In this paper, explore the question of “what has changed”? We note that the emergence\\nof 1) real-time analytic technologies, 2) new governance models that span multiple parties across organizations in a supply chain network, and 3) new digital\\ninnovation requiring partnering with new entities are required to produce end to end analytical capabilities. We offer three new propositions that provide some\\ninsights towards future research areas, and we also note that although interpersonal buyer-seller relationships will remain important, digital transformation is\\nchanging the nature of how these will unfold. Our propositions provide insights on how the role of technology and other shifts in the supply chain ecosystem is\\nshifting the role of buyers and sellers in the industrial landscape. I offer these insights in the hope that they may provide a basis for future researchers to engage in\\nresearch in the field of emerging industrial buyer-seller relationships, and devote this paper to the memory of Christian.\\n\\n\\n1. Introduction\\n\\n\\nIn a paper that became one of the top cited papers in IMM, Christian\\nBechtel and I published a paper on the importance of trust between\\nbuyers and sellers in achieving supply chain agility.1 This study ad-\\nvanced our thesis that creating new relational forms of governance\\nbetween buyers and sellers required an increased reliance on trust,\\nmore so than contractual governance. Our empirical results suggested\\nthat to build relationships based on trust, suppliers had to demonstrate\\na commitment, by investing in in site-specific and human assets dedi-\\ncated to the relationship. In turn, buying companies needed to be more\\nthoughtful in how they structured and engaged in contracts to control\\nfor relative levels of dependence within the relationship.\\n\\n\\nThese developments also included elements such as the degree of\\ndependence, the level of people engaged in the relationship and the\\nlevel of trust that existed between the parties. In the presence of these\\nelements, we found that the outcome was that buyers experienced\\nquicker and improved supply chain responsiveness, with both parties\\nenjoying the benefits of greater volume (for the supplier) and improved\\nperformance (for the buyer).\\n\\n\\nWhat has changed since this paper was published? Although in-\\ndustrial marketing research has explored many of the important con-\\ncepts behind buyer-seller relationships, have more trusting relation-\\nships been fully embraced by industrial buyers during this period? For\\n\\n\\ninstance, the need for greater collaboration and information sharing\\nbetween industrial procurement and marketing is recognized as a cri-\\ntical element for supply chain integration in several literature reviews\\nand special issues of Industrial Marketing Management (Ivens, Pardo, &\\nTunisini, 2009; Johnsen, 2018; Lindgreen, Campello, & Angell, 2016).\\nBut have practices on the part of industrial marketing and procurement\\nreally shifted along with the theoretical shifts proposed in the industrial\\nbuyer-seller literature? And a second related question is whether the\\nrapid shifts in digital supply chains occurring within the last decade\\nhave downplayed the need for of interpersonal and trusting buyer-seller\\nrelationships in the supply chain?\\n\\n\\nIn this paper, I propose that velocity has become the key perfor-\\nmance outcome in modern supply chains. As a result of the need for\\nquicker outcomes, there will be a need for more efficient decision-\\nmaking based on real-time data. Because of these changes in the eco-\\nsystem, we propose three major shifts have permanently changed the\\nway that industrial marketing and purchasing managers work interact,\\nas shown in Fig. 1:\\n\\n\\n• Technology development, brought about by the massive changes in\\ncloud computing, real-time data, social media, “big data”, artificial\\nintelligence, block chain, and smart contracts, have created a need\\nfor more frequent and quicker engagement in buyer-seller re-\\nlationships.

Although documented well\\nin the literature, the need for cross-functional alignment today re-\\nquires that data is shared in real time across multiple stakeholders,\\nrequiring governance mechanisms to promote increased alignment\\nin defining contractual scopes of work, as well as on-going man-\\nagement of contractual outcomes in the face of uncertainty (Toon,\\nMorgan, Lindgreen, Vanhamme, & Hingley, 2016; Wynstra,\\nWeggeman, & van Weele, 2003). This is a significant change in-\\nvolving ways of working.\\n\\n\\n• Suppliers as a source of innovation has been well documented in\\nprior research, but again the need for quicker time to market re-\\ncognizes that shared risks and rewards must be established often in\\nnew industries and domains that do not have strong prior relation-\\nships in place. This includes not only the development and com-\\nmercialization of the product, but also the product launch and life\\ncycle management, which often involves new technology develop-\\nment between industrial buying and supplying parties (Handfield,\\nRagatz, Monczka, & Peterson, 1999; Gonzalez-Zapatero, Gonzalez-\\nBenito, & Lannelongue, 2016).\\n\\n\\nIncreasing shifts to a digital ecosystem have escalated in the last\\n5 years, due to major changes in the global economy and emerging\\ntechnology. The explosion of data, cloud-based computing, and the rise\\nof other forms of technological innovations have allowed organizations\\nto access more data than ever before in real-time. Real-time data can be\\ntransmitted within 15 s or less, a fact that enables managers to under-\\nstand and predict what internal users and customers will need right\\nnow (Handfield & Linton, 2017). During this same period, rapidly\\nshifting demand and global events have led to the recognition that re-\\nsponse velocity is the key ingredient for managing uncertainty in global\\nsupply chains. How have these digital technologies shifted the role of\\nindustrial marketing and procurement? I note in this paper that al-\\nthough the nature of buyer-seller relationships is well understood in the\\nresearch, three major shifts in the ecosystem are new, and the effects on\\nindustrial marketing relationships are still unfolding. I offer some in-\\nsights on how these changes may play out in the years ahead, and\\npresent a framework for exploration of these issues for future re-\\nsearchers.\\n\\n\\nFirst, the ability to disperse supply chain data rapidly has been\\nenabled through development of technological capabilities that provide\\ninexpensive cloud-based computing, distributed computing ‘at the\\nedge’, and the growth of a digital ecosystem (Handfield & Linton,\\n\\n\\n2017). While the issue of visibility has been invoked for many years\\n(Barratt & Adegoke, 2007), we are only now seeing the technology that\\nmakes real-time data a reality (Handfield & Linton, 2017). Even\\nGalbraith (1974) predicted that one day the emergence of online, real-\\ntime structures producing instantaneous information would have\\npowerful ramifications in terms of organization structures that would\\nbe needed to process this change: “Information is a source of power,\\nand so the present power structure is threatened. Most of our attitudes\\nand behaviors still reflect hierarchical and sequential processing of\\ndata.” (p. 42, Galbraith, 1974). As such, collaboration in a velocity-\\ndriven era requires a different set of norms for managing industrial\\nbuyer-seller relationships, requiring differentiated approaches for\\nmanaging event transparency, visibility material flows, and a time-de-\\nfined component (Chen, Preston, & Swink, 2015; Oliveira & Handfield,\\n2018).\\n\\n\\nA second change is that increased response velocity will requires a\\nnew form of governance over buyer and seller relationships, which now\\ntypically consist of multiple stakeholders linked in networked supply\\nchains. Prior industrial marketing research has established that in-\\ndividuals are no longer the sole decision-makers in B2B relationships,\\nbut that multiple stakeholders are playing a role (Handfield, Cousins,\\nLawson, & Petersen, 2015; Rinehart, Eckert, Handfield, Page, & Atkin,\\n2003). Supply management executives themselves recognize that they\\ncannot operate in a void, and have begun to establish contractual\\nperformance objectives that extend to total cost models spanning\\nmultiple entities in supply chain networks. The field of supply man-\\nagement once had a love affair with the notion of strategic sourcing,\\nwhich sought quick price reductions through volume leveraging, to the\\nexclusion of the most important party in the supply chain: the internal\\ncustomer. As this shift has occurred, procurement organizations have\\nmoved more towards a team-based approach to supply management,\\none in which procurement is no longer the sole decision-maker, but acts\\nas a facilitator to lead a team-based decision, that must also convey the\\nupsteam and downstream impacts of performance (This shift was\\ndocumented in a white paper emerging from a workshop we held in\\n2017 of chief procurement offers and business development execu-\\ntives).\\n\\n\\nHowever, technology and governance over procurement decisions\\nare only part of the story. The third leg of the stool is related to the\\nreliance of large companies on new providers of digital services to drive\\ninnovation. The reliance on external suppliers for innovation has been\\nwell documented in industrial marketing research, and has occurred in\\nconjunction due to mergers and growth in the size of Fortune 500\\ncompanies. Many of these companies have begun to shed R&D\\n\\n\\nShifts to Relationships\\nContracts\\n\\n\\nSite Asset Specificity\\n(Human or Otherwise)Trust\\n\\n\\nVelocity as the\\nPerformance Outcome\\n\\n\\nReal-time Analytics\\nReal-time performance\\nMultiple data sources\\nLinkages to customer goals\\nPersonalized views by role\\n\\n\\nMulti-Stakeholder\\nRelationships:  \\n\\n\\nMeasurement\\nCommunication\\nCongruent capabilities\\nQuicker response\\n\\n\\nShared Innovation Risk\\nJoint product life cycle \\nCo-development  - product portfolios\\nShared geographical expansion\\nOn-site suppliers sharing risks\\n\\n\\nShifts to Relationships\\n\\n\\nFig. 1.

Handfield Industrial Marketing Management 83 (2019) 194–206\\n\\n\\n195\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfunctions, and have sought to outsource business processes that once\\nresided within their companies (Ivens et al., 2009). Outsourcing dra-\\nmatically changed the nature of buyer-seller relationships, and the role\\nof procurement as the primary business function responsible for\\nmanaging third party suppliers increased both in scope and importance\\n(Monczka et al., 2018). The practice of servitization emerged as ana-\\nlytical capabilities are now considered a part of product offerings, re-\\nquiring organizations to partner with new providers of “analytics as a\\nservice”, who must become integrated into their value chains. In ad-\\ndition, industrial marketers are awakening to the fact that they are\\ndealing with a much more powerful procurement function, that is more\\ncentralized, reports directly to the Chief Financial Officer, and has a\\nmandate to drive total cost savings (Handfield, Choi, & Jeong, 2019;\\nMonczka et al., 2016). As the outsourcing of product development ac-\\ncompanied a shift of contract manufacturing to Asia, we witnessed the\\nemergence of “original design manufacturers” who became responsible\\nfor both designing and manufacturing goods and services (Handfield\\net al., 1999; Peterson, Handfield, & Ragatz, 2005). More companies in\\nindustries such as automotive, electronics, life sciences and apparel\\nnow rely on overseas suppliers as the primary source of new product\\ndevelopment and innovation (Cousins, Lawson, Handfield, & Peterson,\\n2009). Many are now also relying on digital providers to supplement\\ntheir supply chain capabilities and product offerings. (An excellent\\nexample is the entry of Google and other parties developing automated\\nvehicle technology in Detroit). Yet much of the research on buyer-seller\\nrelationships assumes reliance on established models of supplier-led\\ninnovation, that may not apply in this new context.\\n\\n\\nTo explore the shift in buyer-seller relationships in light of these\\nissues, I begin by revisiting the components of the relationship model\\nthat was explored in our paper published in Industrial Marketing\\nManagement in 2002, and consider them in light of the three shifts\\nidentified here: 1) digital transformation and the rise of big data ana-\\nlytics, 2) the shift in governance models within the procurement\\nfunction in industry, and 3) outsourcing of product innovation and\\nproduction capabilities to global suppliers, In reviewing these shifts I\\nwill highlight prior research in industrial marketing, and augment these\\nfindings in light of recent industry interviews conducted at an executive\\nroundtable in 2017.\\n\\n\\n2. Handfield and Bechtel (2002): revisiting the ties that bind in\\nindustrial buyer-seller relationships\\n\\n\\nIn an effort to better understand this issue, North Carolina State\\nUniversity's Supply Chain Resource Cooperative held a one-day ex-\\necutive summit, to discuss these issues in an open forum. We invited\\neight procurement executives from oil and gas, electronics, business\\nservices, industrial manufacturing, chemicals, and healthcare in-\\ndustries, and brought them in to meet with five sales executives from a\\nlarge third-party logistics provider. In this forum, we asked executives\\nto respond to several gaps identified between sales and procurement\\nexecutives that typically occur, and transcribed all of the comments\\nmade in the ensuing debates and discussions that occurred. These notes\\nwere coded and incorporated into the exploration of issues and pre-\\ndictions proposed in this paper. Both groups shared their internal tools\\nand mindsets around customer/supplier relationships, key issues that\\ndefine strategic relationships, the effective use of performance mea-\\nsurement, and the types of disagreements that occur around contract\\nnegotiations. The outcomes provide a compelling picture of the great\\nmisunderstandings and myths that often exist in both sales executives\\nand procurement executives as they approach one another, and served\\nas the catalyst for this paper.\\n\\n\\nOur work in 2002 noted that buyers and sellers are indeed bound by\\na number of different factors that constituted the “ties” that bind in-\\ndustrial relationships. After 30 years of teaching, research, and con-\\nsulting in the field of supply chain, I still believe these three elements\\nare the foundation of buyer-seller relationships. In Fig. 1, I have shown\\n\\n\\nthe three foundational components explored in the Handfield and\\nBechtel (2002) publication in IMM. In general, we proposed that a tight\\nrelationship exists between buyers and sellers, that are defined by in-\\nvestments in human and site-specific assets, contractual engagements,\\nand trust. These three components form the glue that binds relation-\\nships, producing value in the form of increased responsiveness. As\\nnoted in the introduction, these concepts are still very much in play in\\ntoday's global environment. However, with the shifts in globalization,\\ntechnology, and the changing nature of buyer-seller relationships, we\\nbelieve it is also high time that these relationships be explored in a new\\ncontext. What has changed? In short, we introduce the primary per-\\nformance parameter emerging in the new ecosystem is velocity, and\\npropose how this measure creates the need for different modes of re-\\nlationship management among buyers and sellers:\\n\\n\\n• Real-time analytics define the relationship between trust and asset\\nperformance\\n\\n\\n• Multi-stakeholder governance models supported by analytics are\\nused to establish trust, with “smart” contracts also supporting this\\nlinkage\\n\\n\\n• Shared innovation risks must be assessed to manage asset mobili-\\nzation and intellectual property contractual guidelines, as relation-\\nships will be key to success in this medium.\\n\\n\\n3. Velocity as the new performance outcome measure\\n\\n\\nIn our 2002 article, we noted that “responsiveness” was a key out-\\ncome measure sought from closer buyer-seller relationships. In today's\\nrapidly shifting environment, we propose that a similar measure,\\nVelocity, is a better descriptor for the benefits of improved relation-\\nships, as it refers to multiple attributes of the B2B relationship\\n(Handfield & Linton, 2017). From a financial perspective, velocity is the\\nability of an organization to flow working capital rapidly from suppliers\\nthrough to end customers, and to generate free cash flow. Working\\ncapital generally takes the form of inventory, an asset that doesn't\\nproduce any revenue or cash. Thus, a key benefit of faster decision-\\nmaking is the ability to hold less inventory, and generate more free\\ncash. Supply chains that operate in “real-time” decision-making mode\\nuse velocity capabilities in multiple ways that impact business pro-\\ncesses, which goes beyond generating greater free cash flow (Handfield\\n& Linton, 2017). Real-time data in the supply chain produces faster\\nmanagement responses in:\\n\\n\\n• Determining the volume and mix of product to schedule for delivery;\\n• Scheduling incoming material and communicating with suppliers;\\n• Updating forecasts of products that customers want\\n• Establishing the time and modes of efficient, responsive transpor-\\ntation providers,\\n\\n\\n• Planning and scheduling personnel in distribution and warehouse\\noperations,\\n\\n\\n• Establishing how to move product through global logistics systems\\nmore efficiently and using which modes;\\n\\n\\n• Scaling up production of new products quickly that are “hot” in the\\nmarket;\\n\\n\\n• Communicating instantaneously with personnel who must make\\ndecisions related to unexpected events and disruptions that impact\\nmaterial flow in all roles across the supply chain (suppliers, dis-\\ntributors, customers).\\n\\n\\nThe ability to respond to real-time data and derive supply chain\\nperformance improvements is closely linked to prior work in organi-\\nzational information processing theory (OIPT). According to OIPT, an\\norganization's information processing capabilities must be aligned with\\nits information needs. That is, an organization must be able to gather,\\ninterpret, synthesise, and coordinate information across the organiza-\\ntion (Burns & Wholey, 1993). Processing information in such a\\n\\n\\nR. Handfield Industrial Marketing Management 83 (2019) 194–206\\n\\n\\n196\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstructured and logical way reduces uncertainty and helps various de-\\ncision makers develop a shared interpretation of the information (Daft\\n& Lengel, 1986). This in turn can lead to faster decision-making.\\n\\n\\nThe move towards providing data to others in the supply chain is an\\nimportant component of the research on servitization, a business model\\ninnovation is the product of a servitization strategy, where a manu-\\nfacturing firm with a product business model expands its offering into\\nservices related to its products and, as a result, shifts from the “product-\\nonly” business model to the “service-oriented”model (Cusumano, Kahl,\\n& Suarez, 2014). This is related to the concept of emerging define\\n“business models” (Amit & Zott, 2012), defined as a system of inter-\\nconnected and interdependent activities that determines the way the\\ncompany “does business” with its customers, partners, and vendors.\\nServitization has received growing attention within the innovation\\ncommunity over the recent years (Blindenbach-Driessen & Van den\\nEnde, 2014; Ostrom et al., 2010). While often heralded as a move that\\ncreates value for the customer, there are many performance implica-\\ntions of the business model changes that underpin servitization (Fang,\\nPalmatier, & Steenkamp, 2008; Martinez, Bastl, Kingston, & Evans,\\n2010; Suarez, Cusumano, & Kahl, 2013). Real-time visibility in supply\\nchains is an important part of the service model being required to do\\nbusiness in the new ecosystem. Technology is spawning networked\\nbusiness models, including the demand-based view wherein companies\\nemploy various platform-systems to create value by saving time, effort,\\nand/or investments in learning for their customers, thereby generating\\n“economies of scope in use” (Ye, Priem, & Alshwer, 2012). However, as\\nnoted by Visnjic, Weingarten, and Neely (2016), the performance im-\\npact of servitization is not yet well-defined. This was stated succinctly\\nby a senior executive in our workshop from a global third-party logistics\\nprovider, “After we invest all this capital in real-time data, customers\\nthen expect to receive it for free. There is no good ROI measure of how\\nmuch market share we capture, it is simply now a part of being in\\nbusiness!”\\n\\n\\nThe opposite of visibility is opaqueness, or the absence of visibility\\non what is happening in an organization's upstream and downstream\\nnetworks. When individuals have visibility to events that enable deci-\\nsion-making velocity, minor problems and disruptions are resolved\\nmore quickly and easily before they escalate into bigger problems\\n(Craighead, Blackhurst, Rungtusanatham, & Handfield, 2007). Ex-\\namples of visibility include demand visibility, market visibility, and\\nsupply visibility (Chen et al., 2015; Williams, Roh, Tokar, & Swink,\\n2013). Speed of decision-making increases not just the flow of in-\\nformation, but also the flow of materials, shipments, production, and all\\nactivities in the chain. A metaphor is that of reducing friction, which\\nincreases flow, where friction includes all of the typical delays and\\nproblems that slow material flows and increase inventory. Examples\\ninclude the multiple layers of approvals for purchase orders, delays in\\n\\n\\ndecisions when a forecast deviation occurs, or the lack of response\\nwhen a major disruption shuts down shipments to customers. Friction\\ncan produce bottlenecks in production systems and shipments, which\\ndelays material and causes inventory to build up or shortages to occur\\n(Handfield & Linton, 2017). Examples include the Tianjin explosion, the\\ntsunami in Japan, and the port closure in Los Angeles.\\n\\n\\nThese principles are not new. Many of the concepts around ‘lean\\nproduction systems’ and JIT have emphasized flow and visibility for\\ndecades. For instance, Li, Chung, Goldsby, and Holsapple (2008)\\nmaintain that demand information sharing and visibility enable im-\\nproved supply chain responsiveness, alerting executives to opportu-\\nnities and challenges in the extended supply chain (Dove, 2005;\\nHolsapple & Kiku, 2005). But the emergence of real-time information\\nthat enables the instantaneous visibility of assets across multiple tiers in\\nsupply chains has only been realized in the last two years (Handfield &\\nLinton, 2017). Real-time data is enabled by the emergence of cloud\\ncomputing and mobile devices, which creates ‘big data’ technology\\nplatforms that process higher volumes of internal and external data\\nfrom multiple sources (Chen et al., 2015).\\n\\n\\nAs buyer-seller relationships and the link to increased velocity for\\ndecision-making across not only the internal enterprise, but the ex-\\ntended enterprise which includes buyers and sellers? What are the re-\\nlational components and inter-personal changes that must occur, to\\nensure that a higher volume of real-time data has a meaningful im-\\nprovement in performance velocity? These questions are explored and\\nshown in the context of our original model shown in Tables 1 and 2.\\n\\n\\nAre these shifts unique to a specific industry? The shifts identified in\\nthe book “The LIVING Supply Chain” are taking place across a diverse\\nset of 12 industrial verticals, that are all being impacted by the move to\\nreal-time supply chain analytics. There is evidence to suggest that some\\nindustries are adopting more quickly to the new demands than others.\\nFor example, automotive, electronics, and technology are moving much\\nmore quickly in adopting the move to analytics, whereas oil and gas,\\nutilities, healthcare and life sciences are traditionally much slower to\\nadopt the new technological shifts (Chick & Handfield, 2014).\\n\\n\\n4. Shift 1: technologies that share data through real-time analytics\\n\\n\\nIn the 2002 study, we recognized the important relationship be-\\ntween trust and asset specificity. Specifically, we noted that trust occurs\\nthrough more frequent interaction, as well as assets invested by the\\nseller to the site. In our 2002 study, which is also the case today, the use\\nof long contractual agreements is rarely going to increase trust in a\\nrelationship. Instead, an important proxy for creation of trust in the\\nnew management environment is the sharing of real-time analytics,\\nusing data as the new asset. Technology has emerged to the point where\\nelectronic communication can now occur in real-time, and also through\\n\\n\\nTable 1\\nTranslating Handfield and Bechtel (2002) in light of real-time shifts.\\n\\n\\nHypotheses Empirical\\nrelationship\\n\\n\\nSHIFT: technologies and real-time analytics Predictions /possible impacts\\n\\n\\nBuyer Dependence→ Formal contracts,\\ntrust\\nResponsiveness\\n\\n\\n+*\\nn.s.\\n-**\\n\\n\\n• Real-time data requires joint technology\\ninvestments and contractual commitments\\n\\n\\n• Creation of meaningful analytics requires alignment\\nand trust\\n\\n\\nFormal contracts → trust n.s. • Emergence of block chains and smart contracts\\nlinking events to contract contingencies\\n\\n\\n• Block chains become an enabler for trust and role of\\nsmart contracts may increase\\n\\n\\nSite specific assets → trust\\nHuman assets\\n\\n\\n+*\\n+**\\n\\n\\n• Outsourcing has reduced interpersonal\\ncollaboration\\n\\n\\n• Real-time analytics allow all parties to see\\nwhat is happening\\n\\n\\n• Buyer-seller relationship outcomes become more\\nvisible\\n\\n\\n• Analytics has potential to increase communication and\\ntrust\\n\\n\\nHuman assets→ trust\\nResponsiveness\\n\\n\\nn.s.\\nn.s.\\n\\n\\n• AI, natural language processing, and big data\\ncan be quantified to speed up human decisions\\n\\n\\n• Managers will require skills in interpreting and\\nderiving meaning from data along with their supply\\nchain partners\\n\\n\\nTrust → responsiveness +** • Real-time visibility of events allows increased\\nresponsiveness\\n\\n\\n• Real-time visibility requires trust to build shared data\\nplatforms and governance mechanisms\\n\\n\\nR.

Each of these developments\\nwill have profound effects on how data is exchanged, which allows\\ngreater visibility, and in turn, creates greater trust as both parties are\\naware of how the other is responding to shifts in the supply chain\\necosystem. The emergence of real-time analytics will have profound\\nand unknown impacts on buyer-seller relationships, as the ability to see\\nwhat is happening in real time will change the dynamics of inter-firm\\nrelationships, as shown in Table 1.\\n\\n\\n4.1. Buyer dependence\\n\\n\\nBlind trust is no longer something that organizations function with,\\nand although the internet has expanded the number of suppliers that\\nbuyers can work with, embedded analytics and real-time data can act to\\nimprove tighter relationships between buyers and sellers. As organi-\\nzational analytics have become more mainstream, managers are now\\nrelying much more on real-time performance analytics to monitor\\nsupply chain performance. Sales personnel may also conduct quarterly\\nbusiness reviews with their clients, but must be prepared to deal with\\nthe fact that stakeholders will not want to wait to be informed of per-\\nformance (Krause, Handfield, & Tyler, 2007). In fact, a recent executive\\nnoted that managers want to “push a button to see performance”, and\\naren't willing to wait until the end of the quarter. Buyers and sellers will\\nneed to think about how to create inter-organizational performance\\nanalytics on-demand.\\n\\n\\n4.2. Contracts\\n\\n\\nAlthough the relationship between contracts and trust was not sig-\\nnificant in our prior study, we may yet see a day when block chains,\\nconnected through an Internet of Things sensing system, may be tied to\\n“smart contracts” that link specific events to contractual requirements\\n(Handfield & Linton, 2017).\\n\\n\\n4.3. Site-specific and human-specific assets\\n\\n\\nOur prior study found that site-specific assets and human assets\\nwere important predictors of trust and responsiveness in relationships\\n(Handfield & Bechtel, 2002; Krause et al., 2007). As organizations roll-\\nout real-time analytics, real-time data on current inventory levels, de-\\nmand forecasts, price shifts, and actual order data can facilitate tighter\\ncommunication links between buyers and sellers, and over time, em-\\nbedded analytics can help to also drive the longevity of the relationship.\\nThis may help to avoid having to re-bid the contract every three years\\nor at its termination, as the business case for renewal can be generated\\n\\n\\nif the performance is tracked over time. The capability to create a real-\\ntime supply chain agility relies on the aligned combination of data\\nvisibility, effective data integration and reporting, information sharing\\nand collaborative processes (Frohlich & Westbrook, 2001; Schoenherr &\\nSwink, 2012). Material velocity benefits accrue through ‘real-time data\\nvisibility’, defined as the relative transparency of events, material, and\\nflows to all key decision-makers in the extended supply chain. This\\ndefinition also extends the requirement that real-time data must be of\\n‘high quality’, meaning it is accurate, timely, complete, and in usable\\nforms (Williams et al., 2013). Achieving a high level of real-time visi-\\nbility requires the acquisition of multiple types of high quality supply\\nchain information, which can be classified as either market-level or\\npartner-level information types (Chen et al., 2015). The ability of an\\norganization to derive reliable information about demand and supply\\nconditions allows decision-makers to mitigate uncertainty and antici-\\npate change, enabling improved responsiveness (Reichhart & Holweg,\\n2007). But this in turn assumes that individuals can ‘trust’ the data,\\nwhich is a function of the supply chain's data quality (Pierce, Yonke, &\\nAhmed, 2016).\\n\\n\\n4.4. Trust and responsiveness\\n\\n\\nA prior study found an important linkage between trust and re-\\nsponsiveness. In the current environment, we propose that real-time\\nvisibility may help create a basis for trust, but will not completely re-\\nplace the importance of “face to face” quarterly business reviews\\n(QBR's) between buyers and sellers. Procurement executives who par-\\nticipated in our roundtable event emphasized that they believe QBR's\\nare an important part of the buyer-seller relationship, and believe that\\nprocurement should lead the team, set up the timing of these reviews,\\ninvite the key participants, and follow-up on the outcomes of the re-\\nviews. As such, it is important that key business stakeholders from the\\ncustomer participate, and that the business development lead for the\\nrelationship also be involved. Typically, customer business re-\\npresentatives will be involved in scoring the evaluations for Cost,\\nService, Quality/Safety, Innovation, and Contract Compliance. Data\\ncollection to “feed” the scorecard may be collected through operational\\nsystems outputs, internal satisfaction surveys, external performance\\nmetrics, or other analytics sources. The extent to which the business\\nstakeholder is involved in QBR's is a function of how mature the pro-\\ncurement organization is, and reflects the extent to which the right\\npeople are engaged and attending.\\n\\n\\n4.5. Dependence and data\\n\\n\\nIn our prior study, we found that buyer dependence led to increased\\n\\n\\nTable 2\\nTranslating Handfield and Bechtel (2002) in context of stakeholder shifts.\\n\\n\\nHypotheses Empirical\\nrelationship\\n\\n\\nSHIFT: multi-stakeholder relationships Predictions/possible impacts\\n\\n\\nBuyer dependence → formal\\ncontracts,\\nTrust\\nResponsiveness\\n\\n\\n+*\\nn.s.\\n-**\\n\\n\\n• Sellers are interested in working with\\n“customers of choice”\\n\\n\\n• Buyers are relying more on centralized\\nprocurement teams\\n\\n\\n• Multi-stakeholder performance reviews will become\\nmore important\\n\\n\\n• Decision-making will rely on a broader set of metrics\\nFormal contracts → trust n.s. • Supplier scorecards will be used to assess\\n\\n\\ninformation in quarterly reviews\\n• Supplier scorecards will reflect real-time outcomes\\n• Performance outcomes will be linked to contract\\n\\n\\ncontingencies electronically\\nSite specific assets → trust\\n\\n\\nHuman assets\\n+*\\n+**\\n\\n\\n• Supply base segmentation will define supplier\\nroles\\n\\n\\n• Buyers moving towards local suppliers in a\\nglobal market\\n\\n\\n• Sellers will need to manage multiple stakeholder needs\\n• Centralized and decentralized governance will be needed\\n\\n\\nHuman assets→ trust\\nResponsiveness\\n\\n\\nn.s.\\nn.s.\\n\\n\\n• Shifting roles of procurement and sales in\\ndifferent stages of the relationships\\n\\n\\n• Sales will need to adjust their approach based on the\\ninternal dynamics of buyers organization\\n\\n\\nTrust → responsiveness +** • Trust remains the glue of relationships\\n• Partners must also establish aligned metrics that\\n\\n\\ndrive mutual value\\n\\n\\n• Sellers have an opportunity to leverage their data to\\nembed customer relationships\\n\\n\\nR. Handfield Industrial Marketing Management 83 (2019) 194–206\\n\\n\\n198\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nuse of contracts, trust, and responsiveness. In an emerging digital en-\\nvironment, we believe that dependence is also a factor, in that sellers\\ncan offer access to real-time analytics as a component of the relation-\\nship, offering access to data across multiple-stakeholders, not just the\\nbusiness owner or the procurement manager. In this discussion, it is\\nimportant to differentiate between real-time information technology,\\nand real-time visibility. The difference lies in the degree of control over\\nthe information, and the extent to which the enterprise allows multiple\\ntiers of individuals in the supply chain to view and react to real-time\\ndata. An organization may invest in real-time technology, but exert\\ntight control over its dispersion. In fact, many organizations have in-\\nvested in very tightly controlled systems called ‘control towers’\\n(Handfield & Linton, 2017) that restrict access to real-time data. In a\\ncontrol tower, information from all of an organization's logistics sys-\\ntems, production facilities, inbound shipments, outbound shipments,\\nand inventory levels are dumped into a massive data warehouse (Bentz,\\n2014). The information is then centralized into a ‘control tower’, where\\nindividuals are scanning unfolding events, and senior executives render\\ndecisions, sometimes aided by complicated algorithms and automated\\nordering systems.\\n\\n\\nThe fundamental assumption behind control towers is that senior\\nexecutives removed from the day-to-day have the best knowledge of\\nhow to optimize the entire supply chain, because they are the only ones\\nwho have access to all of the data. Much of the data is ‘integrated’ (e.g.,\\nlumped together) from ERP systems, transportation management sys-\\ntems (TMS's), warehouse management systems (WMS's), distribution\\nrequirement systems (DRPs) and material requirement planning sys-\\ntems (MRP's). Because many of these systems are in a ‘batch mode’,\\nmeaning they are updated on a weekly, or perhaps daily basis, the in-\\nformation being viewed in the control tower is always lagging. As a\\nresult, decision-makers in the control tower are making decisions based\\non what happened a few days ago, and are determining what to do next\\nbased on what they think will happen next. Some may refer to this as\\n‘real-time visibility’, but it is not, as it is limited by the capability of the\\nsystems to generate data as events occur.\\n\\n\\nThe importance of data as a critical asset, and the ownership of data,\\nwill become a central point on which buyer-seller relationships will be\\nconstructed. In an outsourced world, sellers will often be the ones\\nmanaging the customers performance data, including demand in-\\nformation, customer preferences, forecasts, unmet needs, inventory\\nvelocity, and a host of other data. These data can eventually become the\\nbasis for new analytic products, that may be sold as a service to cus-\\ntomers, and which also can become a vehicle to cement and sustain\\nlong-term relationships between buyers and sellers. Indeed, I believe\\nthat analytics generated from prior transactions will also yield im-\\nportant performance metrics, that may be tied to “smart contracts”, and\\nwhich are viewed and managed in real-time. Thresholds on perfor-\\nmance may be established, whereby quarterly review meetings may not\\nbe necessary, facilitated instead by real-time data views. Sales teams\\nwill not have to set about preparing a set of powerpoint presentations\\nsummarizing key data outcomes based on the last quarters' perfor-\\nmance. Instead, real-time views of performance data, coalesced from\\nmultiple sources including Internet of Things sensors, distributed\\ncomputing, real-time feeds from diverse systems, and social media may\\nbe integrated into singular views of customer performance.\\n\\n\\nControl-towers embody the ‘old’ themes of ‘supply chain integra-\\ntion’: batch processing, information updates, ‘control-tower’ thinking\\nwhere only some people see the information, and decisions requiring\\nsignoffs by senior executives. The opposite of a control tower is a ‘data\\ndemocracy’, wherein all members of the supply chain can simulta-\\nneously gain access to the same information on related events. This is\\nparticularly true for sustaining customer-supplier relationships, where\\nembedded analytics will become the foundation for reviewing perfor-\\nmance outcomes, and identifying opportunities for improved colla-\\nboration and innovation. Our review of the research literature reveals a\\ndearth of information that describes how organizations are combining\\n\\n\\nmobile computing and system-wide supply chain analytics to derive\\nreal-time, data democracy capabilities across extended supply chain\\n(Handfield & Linton, 2017; Oliveira & Handfield, 2018). This phe-\\nnomenon is so new (e.g. Flex installed its real-time Pulse Centre in\\n2016) that the research literature has not yet caught up with current\\nevents (Handfield & Linton, 2017).\\n\\n\\nAn executive at a large contract manufacturer we interviewed stated\\nthis as follows:\\n\\n\\n“Real time supply chains are the anti-control tower. ‘Think about\\nvisibility in the context of driving your car. If you are watching your\\nspeedometer, you don't want information on your vehicle's velocity\\nfrom a week ago, an hour ago, or even a minute ago! You want to\\nknow how fast you are moving right now!’ The same principle ap-\\nplies to the supply chain. To make informed decisions based on in-\\nsight pulled from data, we need the data to be as fresh and as current\\nas possible!”\\n\\n\\nAs one looks to the future, the value of Big Data, and the ability to\\ncontrol dimensions of the end to end supply chain, its structure, and\\nfuture business models in demand-supply systems will radically change.\\nWhoever controls buyer-seller data may have the greatest influence on\\nthe structure of business models in the demand-supply systems (eco-\\nsystems), including the impact on current roles, power positions, value-\\ncreation, and value capture. A good example of such a power play is by\\nlarge third-party logistics providers, who are moving to become “Fourth\\nparty logistics providers”, also called a “Lead Logistics Provider”, sug-\\ngesting that they would be capable of capturing and managing data\\nfrom multiple providers, and able to provide a single integrating me-\\nchanism to manage all entities on behalf of the primary customer.\\nCurrent shifts in technology, macroeconomic trends, increased opera-\\ntional constraints crossing borders, and customer-driven service has\\ninspired some companies to create supply chain innovation divisions,\\ntasked with helping to identify approaches to the evolution of supply\\nchain outsourcing. All parties recognize that central focus of being an\\nLLP is on managing big data in real time to produce actionable analy-\\ntics. For instance, a recent study conducted by several academics and\\nconsultants in Germany of Fourth Party Logistics Provider services\\n(Schramm, Czaja, Dittrich, & Mentschel, 2019) reveals several im-\\nportant trends, based on a panel of experts and an online questionnaire.\\nThe results suggest that:\\n\\n\\n• Current 4PL solutions focus on transport management and 3PL se-\\nlection, focusing on service audits, customs management, and en-\\nsuring that logistics operations run smoothly.\\n\\n\\n• There is no “standard” 4PL service offering except for basic trans-\\nport and logistics management services. Future 4PL services will be\\nspecifically targeted at the client's needs with different degrees of\\nresponsibility given to 4PL's.\\n\\n\\n• There is a move towards 4PL's providing an IT platform as part of\\ntheir service. It doesn't appear to matter if the 4PL establishes and\\nhosts the platform, or sources it from an external IT Provider and\\nsupervises operations.\\n\\n\\n• The most important function of 4PL's will be managing internal\\nintegration and end to end solutions. Such integration is the key\\nfoundation for providing further 4PL services related to data ana-\\nlysis.\\n\\n\\n• Value-added analytics services will be important in addition to\\nmonitoring activities.\\n\\n\\n• Partnerships between 4PL's and their clients are transferring from\\noperational to closer strategic relationships. Managing a partnership\\nthrough trust and transparency will be critical.\\n\\n\\n• A clear predictor of 4PL provider success is their ability to adapt\\ndigital technologies and transfer the advantages to their client's\\nbusiness.\\n\\n\\nAs more organizations recognize that logistics is not their strong\\n\\n\\nR. Handfield Industrial Marketing Management 83 (2019) 194–206\\n\\n\\n199\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nsuit, they will be seeking reliable, trustworthy partners that can operate\\ntheir logistics network for them. They will expect a strong suite of IT\\ncapabilities to be provided, even if these are not yet developed or\\navailable in the market. These types of engagements, however, have the\\npotential to create game-changing capabilities in the market if effec-\\ntively tied to client's business strategy and objectives. In light of these\\ninsights, we offer the following proposition that seems to suggest a shift\\nthat may occur through the emergence of digitization and real-time\\ntechnologies:\\n\\n\\nProposition 1. Emergence of real-time digital analytics will produce\\nsupply chain services that will manage end to end integration, to drive\\nimproved understanding of events in the supply chain, and drive\\ngreater collaborative behaviour across multiple tiers in the ecosystem.\\nIn such relationships, trust will be important, but may involve multiple\\nbuyers and sellers from different stages of the supply chain, not just a\\nsingle link.\\n\\n\\nBecause of the novelty of real-time supply chain technology, re-\\nsearch has yet to provide evidence on who will set the standards for\\nsharing data across multiple tiers. We found few empirical studies\\nsupporting the application of real-time data in improving supply chain\\noutcomes to date. Current research on real-time supply chains hint at\\nthe emerging capabilities of being able to access large pools of ‘big data’\\n(Chen et al., 2015; Gandomi & Murtaza, 2015; Geisler, Quix, Weber, &\\nJarke, 2016) supply chain analytics (Acito & Khatri, 2014; Chen, Roger,\\nChiang, & Storey, 2012), and the application of real-time data in control\\ntower settings (Bentz, 2014). Future research is needed to better un-\\nderstand how technologies will shift behaviors in buyer-seller re-\\nlationships. The digital era will also create another shift: the move to-\\nwards multiple stakeholders, not only within bi-lateral relationships,\\nbut across multiple organizations.\\n\\n\\n5. Shift 2: buyer-seller relationships are owned by multiple\\nstakeholders\\n\\n\\nThe relationship between sales and procurement has always been a\\ncontentious one, and since 2002, the introduction of greater competi-\\ntion and transparency through the Internet has made this even more\\ncompetitive. Coupled with the emphasis on greater global competition,\\nthe relationship between buyers and sellers may often be considered\\nunder greater pressure and tension. The issue at the core of this tension\\nis the concept of value recognition.\\n\\n\\nThe ‘cross-functional management of buyer-supplier relationships’\\nhas been evolving since the JIT and multi-tier supplier movement from\\nthe 1990's and has been driven further by the emergence of enabling\\ntechnologies (flexible manufacturing, internet enabled interfaces, etc.)\\nand economic pressure (Monczka, Handfield, Giunipero, & Patterson,\\n2018; Rinehart et al., 2003). The latter relates to the increasing com-\\nplexity and systemic character of the end offerings (product & service\\npackages) leading to increased cost, which drives increased supplier\\ncollaboration and to entire systems outsourcing (Ahuja, 2000; Chen,\\nPaulraj, & Lado, 2004). This long-term evolution has resulted in new\\nforms of ecosystems, including the emergence of OEMs and special\\nservice providers. The latter changes have been driving our third pro-\\nposed shift (supplier engagement in new product development) for over\\ntwo-decades especially in the electronics and automotive fields. In fact,\\ncontract manufacturing organizations have evolved to become “original\\ndesign manufacturers”, where the design, commercialization, and pro-\\nduction of new products is outsourced entirely to a third party. At some\\nof these contract manufacturers, the customer selling the product will\\nhave their brand on it, but may never touch or design the product at all\\n(Handfield & Linton, 2017).\\n\\n\\nThe nature of increased cross-functional decision-making has been\\nresearched extensively in the marketing literature. The original work by\\nWebster and Wind (1972) and Sheth (1973) presented a general model\\nfor understanding organizational buying behavior, which led to\\n\\n\\nhundreds of conceptual and empirical articles. The authors identified\\nthe buying cycle, as well as the situational influences that would occur\\nin this cycle, including issues such as physical, political, economic,\\nsuppliers, technological, legal, cultural, global, group characteristics,\\nand informational characteristics. Role stress and role conflict were also\\nidentified as important later (Vyas & Woodside, 1984). Later work by\\nCampbell and Cunningham (1985) identified the important cross-\\nfunctional roles, including specifiers, buyers, users, sanctioners, and\\ngatekeepers. It is interesting that in current industrial selling models,\\nhowever, we observed in our workshop that marketers displayed a\\nsingular lack of understanding about how purchasing made its decisions\\nin a centralized model, whilst purchasing were also often unaware of\\nhow sellers employed pipeline management and selling models to target\\ndecision-makers. This is not inconsistent with Campbell and Cunning-\\nham's observation that resources are often deployed in relation to the\\neconomic importance of customers, and interpersonal relationships, but\\nseem to ignore the impact of the governance, and context of purchasing\\ndecision-making in the focal firm. For example, one seller noted that “I\\nhad no idea that purchasing is segmenting us in this way.” And a pur-\\nchasing manager observed that “I had no idea that marketing would not\\nrespond to every RFP we put out there.”\\n\\n\\n5.1. Buyer dependence\\n\\n\\nThe movement towards tighter integration in supply chains will\\nlikely increase the dependence of buyers on suppliers, which will make\\nmanagement of these relationships more complicated for sellers in a\\nmulti-stakeholder world. No longer is it acceptable to only work with\\nthe local business representative, and the roles identified in the early\\nwork by Campbell and Cunningham and others has changed sig-\\nnificantly. The new face of procurement recognizes a new set of value\\ndrivers that go beyond cost savings: understanding internal customer\\nrequirements, and codifying these requirements into a coherent state-\\nment of need that can be understood by the external supply market\\n(Handfield et al., 2015; Chick & Handfield, 2014). A framework known\\nas “congruent capability” was introduced by Handfield et al. (2015) as it\\nenables procurement to link internal and external stakeholders that are\\nmutually dependent on one another, imposing a buyer-centric rather\\nthan a seller-centric perspective of the relationship. Congruent cap-\\nability is what an executive we interviewed was referring to when he\\nidentified the ideal of creating a ‘virtual integrated company’ where “…\\nthe existence of suppliers is an explicit outcome of a strategic decision\\nto buy versus make. Implicit in this decision is the question of whether\\nan organization is willing to manage the standards, discipline, execu-\\ntion, fixed capital investments, etc. of the ‘make’ decision, versus the\\nsourcing, negotiation, contracting, and supplier signals associated with\\nthe ‘buy’ decision.” As the primary boundary-spanning interface be-\\ntween the internal and external domains of the enterprise, purchasing\\nhas an exclusive mandate to ensure congruency in performance out-\\ncomes between the stakeholder's expectations and the suppliers re-\\nsulting performance.\\n\\n\\nThe types of congruent contributions that procurement is capable of\\nproviding include product innovation and technology development\\n(Handfield et al., 1999), knowledge sharing and new process capability\\ndevelopment (Dyer & Nobeoka, 2000), multi-tier supplier integration\\n(Choi & Yunsook, 2002), mitigation of supplier risk (Ellis, Shockley, &\\nHenrey, 2011), supplier performance improvement and capability\\naugmentation (Krause & Scannell, 2002; Krause, Scannell, & Calantone,\\n2000), supplier financial disruption avoidance (Wagner, Bode, &\\nKoznol, 2009), and sustainable supply chain improvements (Wieland &\\nHandfield, 2013). Supply management leaders are unanimous in their\\ncall for an evolutionary approach to procurement transformation,\\nthrough the improved alignment of internal stakeholder requirements\\nwith an emerging and growing global supply base (Handfield, 2013;\\nMonczka et al., 2018; Kotabe, Martin, & Domoto, 2003; Chen et al.,\\n2004). In addition, there have been significant shifts in the governance\\n\\n\\nR. Handfield Industrial Marketing Management 83 (2019) 194–206\\n\\n\\n200\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nstructure for buying situations. The nature of cross-functional teams is\\nno longer as simple as it once was, as noted by Johnston and Lewin\\n(1996). In fact, procurement has moved to the use of category man-\\nagement teams, whereby global requirements are often specified after\\nsignificant supply market research, global stakeholder and leveraging\\nmodels, sophisticated total cost of ownership calculations, risk man-\\nagement practices, and shifting supplier evaluation models that account\\nfor these changes (Cousins et al., 2009; Craighead et al., 2007; Krause\\net al., 2007; Oliveira & Handfield, 2018). The nature of these decisions\\nis also impacted more and more by global economics, such as the\\nshifting nature of trade determined by tariffs imposed by the Trump\\nAdministration in 2018–2019. Entire supply chains are being rede-\\nsigned, based on these global economic shifts, which go beyond the\\ninfluence of interpersonal relationships.\\n\\n\\n5.2. Contract governance will become more complex\\n\\n\\nDespite the hundreds of articles discussing how buyers and sellers\\nare becoming more integrated ((Johnston & Lewin, 1996), our work-\\nshop reveals that bi-lateral arms-length relationships are still the norm,\\neven for sectors that are considered “strategic” and involve digital in-\\nnovation. Sales account managers accuse procurement of being purely\\nprice focused, and not recognizing the value of emerging digital solu-\\ntions. Procurement executives on the other hand complain that sales\\naccount managers are always trying to “work around them” to com-\\nmunicate directly engineering, operations, clinicians, or other business\\nstakeholders. “Sales people are always trying to raise prices and ‘design\\nthemselves in’ to our organization, without being competitively ten-\\ndered.” But sales people complain that procurement “does not re-\\ncognize the value we bring to the business, in terms of quality, service,\\nand reducing the total cost of ownership!” In the emerging landscape of\\ndigital technology development, contract negotiation will become more\\ncomplex, and business models and managerial thinking need to adopt to\\nthese conditions.\\n\\n\\nThe bulk of marketing and procurement research since 2002 assume\\nthat value-driven relationships have become the norm. A good deal of\\nresearch in procurement maintains that managers have become more\\n“strategic” in nature. Since the original work by Kraljic (1983) on\\nsupplier segmentation, influential papers have included research on\\nsupply base segmentation (Olsen & Ellram, 1997), as well as classifi-\\ncation of customers for industrial marketers using a variety of frame-\\nworks (Cousins & Spekman, 2003; Krapfel, Salmond, & Spekman, 1991;\\nPark, Shin, Chang, & Park, 2010). On the other hand, procurement has\\nalso recognized that they need to better understand who their suppliers\\nare, as this has often not been an area where sophisticated analysis has\\nbeen done. Today there is more focus on improving supply market in-\\ntelligence (Chick and Handfield, 2016), and more effective commu-\\nnication of this intelligence to other parties in the firm (Handfield et al.,\\n2016). To some extent, an increased focus on supply base risk has\\ndriven this need for intelligence data collection, as supplier disruptions\\noften have significant impacts on buying company operations (Choi &\\nYunsook, 2002; Craighead et al., 2007).\\n\\n\\nIndustrial marketers will need to think differently, in terms of\\nidentifying new approaches to employ digital technologies to reduce\\nend to end supply chain costs for multiple upstream and downstream\\npartners. This is especially true when it comes to the category of in-\\nnovation. About 20% of innovation ideas are cost related, but this level\\nmay not be properly connected into the true sources of business value.\\nIn addition, less than 15% of innovation ideas are ever properly re-\\nsourced and brought to fulfillment. This is because in most cases the\\nROI is greater than 6months. A longer contract planning horizon would\\nundoubtedly translate into a higher proportion of cost savings ideas\\nbeing adopted and implemented. This value proposition clearly needs\\nto go beyond the level of procurement, and engage the business in both\\nservice-level and cost-related performance improvement ideas. One\\nsales executive noted:\\n\\n\\n“We are losing value opportunities by not focusing on the total cost\\nof ownership outcomes of service improvement. Cost is a procurement\\nconversation, and sales team are often not equipped to have this con-\\nversation as they focus more on operational issues. We don't recognize\\nwhat different people want in terms of total cost performance and it\\nmay be an opportunity for us to drive an important source of value.”\\n\\n\\nThe implication is that sales should be educated and trained in the\\napplication of Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), as a means to influence\\nboth procurement and business stakeholders in their customers of the\\npotential savings from operational improvements. Some of the issues\\nassociated with selling through a TCO model might include the fol-\\nlowing:\\n\\n\\n- How do we monetize value from supply chain performance im-\\nprovements?\\n\\n\\n- How do we quantify in dollars the performance value we are\\ncreating and improving on using the current state as a baseline?\\n\\n\\n- How do we aggregate such savings across our volume of product as\\nwell as labor productivity, across multiple tiers of customers?\\n\\n\\n- How do we highlight the financial impacts on working capital, free\\ncash flow, inventory, and other balance sheet items that are a\\nfunction of increased velocity and access to analytics?\\n\\n\\n- What are the primary financial indicators (ROCE, free cash flow,\\netc.) that drives supply chain velocity, and how are we addressing\\nthose?\\n\\n\\nIncreasing value has been shown to lead to improved customer sa-\\ntisfaction, commitment, and trust, which in turns leads to relationship\\ncontinuity (Ulaga & Eggert, 2006). Differentiation in business re-\\nlationships is a key component of value (Ulaga & Eggert, 2006), but in\\nthe context of the digital transformation of the economy, new forms of\\ndifferentiation will become important. Buyers will need to establish\\nincreasing physical and digital linkages with their suppliers, that ensure\\nthey can maintain an essential position in the supply chain network.\\nThis may mean that suppliers too will need to segment their customers,\\nand target those with whom they need to target and segment their asset\\ninvestments around. Complex partnering targeted at generating in-\\nnovative new digital system solutions through a joint value creation\\nprocess will be different than before. These projects are often future\\noriented, and there is no market for a priori assessment of the economic\\nvalue of the inputs of any supplier (Möller & Svahn, 2006; Möller &\\nTörrönen, 2003).\\n\\n\\nWe propose that the following characteristics will need to be con-\\nsidered in targeting industrial marketer's effort to focus on certain\\nsuppliers.\\n\\n\\n• Account Size – Ideally, larger accounts will provide increased op-\\nportunities for digital integration and growth. Note that the size of\\nthe account may not all currently be under a single provider, but\\nshould consider the potential for consolidation of multiple compo-\\nnents of the network (transportation, warehouse, brokering, in-\\nbound/outbound, etc.) that would benefit from a single integrated\\nprovider solution.\\n\\n\\n• Account Complexity – Digital integration is ideally suited for a\\nlarge network, which is often globally spread out, and which pre-\\nsents opportunities for consolidation, global solution partnerships,\\nand brokering solutions.\\n\\n\\n• Key Performance Attributes – Target customers will understand\\nthe value of a Total Cost of Ownership solution that presents itself as\\nan opportunity to optimize across the network, not just within the\\nfour walls of the distribution center or warehouse. Customers will\\nunderstand the goal of reducing working capital and maximizing\\nfree cashflow. Some customers may also have high capital intensity\\noperations (e.g. semiconductors, capacitated manufacturing opera-\\ntions requiring maintenance, specialized FDA compliance require-\\nments, etc.) and understand the value of keeping equipment and\\n\\n\\nR. Handfield Industrial Marketing Management 83 (2019) 194–206\\n\\n\\n201\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfacilities up and running, rather than a low-cost solution which\\nslows down valuable capital operations.\\n\\n\\n• Maturity/Influence of Customer Procurement/SCM – It is not\\nevident that business stakeholders are not the key decision-makers\\nin many organizations, so business development will need to con-\\nsider the role of procurement/SCM. Even in decentralized busi-\\nnesses, procurement may lead category management teams that\\nmay have a high level of influence on the decision. It is important\\nfor business development executives to understand changes in se-\\nnior leadership in procurement, along two dimensions. First, is\\nprocurement likely to understand the importance of adopting a\\nTotal Cost approach to awarding the business? In other words, is this\\na mature procurement function that is not simply going to run an\\nRFQ and award the business to the lowest cost provider on a per unit\\nbasis? Second, does procurement have a strong or weak influence on\\nthe business? Ideally, procurement would have a strong basis for\\nawarding the business based on both a high understanding of the\\ntotal cost, and a high degree of influence on the decision. In such\\ncircumstances, the supplier is more likely to be successful.\\n\\n\\n• Relationship Characteristics – Targeted customers will have a\\nstrong relationship with the supplier, extending several years into\\nthe past. Trust is an important component of success in targeting\\ncustomers, as there are already many barriers that exist in the minds\\nof customers relative to the feasibility of the approach discussed\\nhere (Möller & Törrönen, 2003). Because many of these shifts are so\\nnew, suppliers will need to pilot with customers who are willing to\\ntake on a higher level of risk with this new concept, and be willing\\nto explore how to operate with them in this new mode of business.\\n\\n\\n• Analytics Potential – Establishing “Analytics As a Service” implies\\nthat analytical capabilities will need to be extended beyond the\\ntraditional service-level KPI's associated with third party out-\\nsourcing operations. In addition to prescriptive capabilities opera-\\ntions that may increase efficiency, analytics will need to be devel-\\noped that provide tangible opportunities for improving end to end\\nnetwork performance. This in turn will require buy-in from the\\ncustomer.\\n\\n\\nMany of these issues can be addressed by establishing the proper\\nagenda for Quarterly Business Reviews (QBR's) ahead of time. The\\nagenda should span an overall business view, but also address perfor-\\nmance and cost. An “ideal” agenda that was highlighted by a pro-\\ncurement executive at our meeting was described below.\\n\\n\\n“At _____, we only hold QBR's with our top 20 suppliers. Below the\\ntop 20, there was a six month or annual review held with suppliers. But\\nthe format of the meeting with the top 20 wad the same every time, and\\nwe had a timekeeper to ensure that we didn't go past the two hour\\nmeeting timeframe for each QBR.\\n\\n\\n- State of the Union – what is happening in the business?\\n- Where have we been - an in-depth review of each dimension of\\nperformance in the scorecard, and clarification of where deficiencies\\nare. (30min)\\n\\n\\n- What can we do better? What are the specific actions that need to be\\ntaken to address deficiencies in the next quarter (30min)\\n\\n\\n- Where are we going and where are you taking us? What types of\\ninnovation and suggestions can we consider to drive not only sav-\\nings but improved performance? This might include topics such as\\nvalue analysis, value engineering, productivity improvements, etc.\\n(30min)\\n\\n\\nIn some cases, the review of performance scorecards can produce\\nimportant insights into deficiencies and assumptions regarding perfor-\\nmance that are misaligned, and identify future areas for value creation\\nusing digital innovation and technology. Data and analytics can drive\\nroot-cause analysis, precriptive actions, and predictive modeling for\\nhow to prepare for the quarter and year ahead.\\n\\n\\n5.3. Site specificity and human assets drive trust…But there is a limit\\n\\n\\nOur paper supports the extensive research noting that suppliers\\nneed to dedicate limited resources to customer relationships based on\\nthe return on these investments (Webster and Wind (1972) and Sheth\\n(1973)). With the unfolding of multi-tier integrated business models,\\norganizations will need to recognize that they cannot approach every\\ncustomer in the spirit of partnership. For instance, automotive and oil\\nand gas companies we met with have downsized their supply bases, but\\nare now questioning whether their new tier 1 suppliers have the re-\\nquired capabilities to manage the newly formed tier 2 suppliers. Sales\\nexecutives may need to become more aware of their position in the\\nsupply chain, and how they impact both upstream and downstream\\nparties. A senior sales executive recognized this and noted that “Sales is\\ntrained to over-sell at the expense of the buy. Buyer have to be on high\\nalert with sales people, as they need to be far less relationship-based,\\nand more value based.”\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, it also apparent from our limited sample of buyers\\nand sellers in our roundtable, that both procurement and sales put one\\nanother into a “box”, through their segmentation analysis. Procurement\\nuses a set of strategic segmentation tools that commonly look at a\\nnumber of criteria. Procurement will generally focus on creating cate-\\ngory or “market sector” strategy teams, that seek to create an overall\\nstrategy for a given classification of spending (e.g. castings, professional\\nservices, logistics services, insurance, etc.) The first ‘cut’ is to examine\\nthe business impact of the overall category and the value to be derived,\\nin terms of importance to stakeholders and potential for savings. Next, a\\n“supplier preference” classification attempts to target suppliers that\\ndeem the customer a “core” or “developmental” high potential target.\\nThe next segmentation looks at the level of power in the relationship,\\nand buyers prefer to be in a position of high power to drive a re-\\nlationship (Cousins & Spekman, 2003; Krapfel et al., 1991; Olsen &\\nEllram, 1997; Park et al., 2010). Finally, the degree to which results can\\nbe achieved are highlighted, with difficult complex, low value oppor-\\ntunities receiving less priority. This “filtering” process results in less\\nthan 1% of the supplier population within a market sector being a true\\ntarget for closer relationship meriting performance management re-\\nviews and strategic aligned planning.\\n\\n\\nAn important element to consider here is how sales goes about\\nunderstanding the decision-maker in the procurement relationship. A\\nsenior procurement executive from the electronics industry noted that:\\n\\n\\nIn some cases, procurement does a purposeful job of clouding who\\nthe decision-maker is and how that decision is made. Procurement\\nmay emphasize that sales is forbidden from contacting anyone else\\nin the organization. It is not uncommon for the RFP language to\\ninclude this stipulation, with a specific list of contact people. This\\nlanguage exists not to prevent sales from speaking to decision-ma-\\nkers, but to ensure that procurement provides a fair and balanced\\nview of the proposal to everyone in the organization. World-class\\nprocurement seeks to create transparency of a sales value proposi-\\ntion, and wants to promote the supplier's position to everyone in a\\nbalanced manner.\\n\\n\\nAnother executive, a healthcare procurement professional, also\\nemphasized the importance of internal stakeholder engagement.\\n\\n\\nSales may not be able to create the right relationship with the de-\\ncision-maker to the deal. No procurement team worth its salt be-\\nlieves that a supplier needs to lose money to get their business. In\\nfact, procurement is more of a facilitator, and can actually help you\\nto sell your offering inside the business to multiple stakeholders.\\nAnd I can do it faster than you can without my help. In healthcare,\\nphysicians often have decision-rights on the clinical decision, so\\nsales used to go to them directly and forced procurement to buy it.\\nToday we are implementing clinical category teams led by physi-\\ncians that will sell across multiple hospitals, so you aren't selling it\\n\\n\\nR. Handfield Industrial Marketing Management 83 (2019) 194–206\\n\\n\\n202\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nto one physician at a time. Now we can pull it through, rather than\\ngoing behind our backs and upsetting a lot of people.\\n\\n\\nSales organizations are thus beginning to apply opportunity risk\\nassessments, to consider whether they have a high likelihood of making\\nthe sale. This insight was very surprising to the procurement executives\\nin the room. Only a few could comprehend the fact that sales personnel\\ndo NOT pursue every opportunity (RFQ) that came their way! There are\\nfour primary reasons why customer pursuits are halted in their tracks.\\n\\n\\n1. Limited access to the decision maker – if sales does not have an\\nopportunity to present to the decision-maker, then they won't pro-\\nceed. If a sales manager has the opportunity to make a presentation\\nto the decision-maker (whether it is at the corporate or local level),\\nthey are almost always going to succeed. An important issue here,\\nhowever, is the need to understand WHO the decision-maker is. The\\ninternal procurement-stakeholder relationship is therefore critical to\\nunderstand by sales at this stage, and will thus strongly influence the\\noutcome of the pursuit. Experienced executives note that if there are\\nthree coaches (influencers on the decision-maker) that you can\\nspeak to, than you have a good chance of success to influence the\\nprocess.\\n\\n\\n2. Lack of existing relationship. This is often known as a “cold” re-\\nlationship. If there is no pre-existing relationship with a customer,\\nand no prior engagement, the odds of success are also very low. This\\nmeans that an entire education process has to occur. Also, it is im-\\nportant to recognize the cost of change that the customer will need\\nto go through, and evaluating whether the benefits provided by a\\npotential change in sourcing strategy will outweigh the costs of\\ndoing so. Procurement may not even understand the value propo-\\nsition, and are using the supplier as a “check in the box” to get a\\nthird quote to their RFP, in the hopes of putting more cost pressure\\non the incumbent supplier!\\n\\n\\n3. If the potential customer has never outsourced before, they are\\nunlikely to understand the value proposition of a third-party logis-\\ntics provider. If the decision-maker does not recognize the value\\nstatement, and doesn't understand the value provided, there is a low\\nchance of success.\\n\\n\\n4. If the environment involves a strong incumbent, it is going to be\\nunlikely that you will displace them. If a business development\\nmanager goes into a situation where there are multiple other sup-\\npliers in the running, then they are likely going to be viewed as a\\n“commodity” by the customer, and there is a low likelihood of\\nsuccess.\\n\\n\\nIn all four of these cases, however, there is an education process that\\nmust occur, and an opportunity for sales to help procurement under-\\nstand the nature of the business decision they have to make. The sales\\nteam needs to offer a process and business model that presents an op-\\nportunity that will cover the cost of change. Is there enough value on\\nthe cost of change on their side? An important differentiating feature\\nwill be the analytics around total cost of ownership, as well as uplift on\\nthe revenue side. If there is no access to data to make these analytical\\ninsights, then the sales opportunity is simply not present. On the other\\nhand, if procurement can be convinced of the business case, they will\\nsell the idea up the chain of command.\\n\\n\\nThese insights lead us to our second research proposition:\\n\\n\\nProposition 2. Governance over buyer-seller relationships will become\\nmore complex in the presence of digital technologies, and sellers will\\nneed to differentiate their value through digital technologies to\\nestablish their location in the supply chain network. In such cases,\\nthe outcome will result in a stronger and more embedded position in\\nthe network as digital services become part of doing business in\\norganizational relationships.\\n\\n\\nThis proposition recognizes that working with multiple stakeholders\\n\\n\\nwill make the job of selling more challenging, as there is no long a\\nsingle decision-maker. However, the end result, although it may take\\nlonger to achieve, will result in an aligned scorecard that can be em-\\nployed to capture multiple stakeholder needs in the relationship.\\nUnderstanding the decision-maker in the process is clearly an area that\\nrequires an in-depth assessment, as this can heavily influence the nature\\nof whether to pursue the customer. In the past, sales would rely on\\ninternal relationships with the CEO or COO, who was the presumed\\ndecision-maker. As procurement organizations have matured and come\\ninto their own, sales reliance on C-suite relationships can occur at their\\nown risk. In one healthcare provider, a supplier went to the CEO when\\nturned down by procurement due to performance issues, and was\\npromptly told that they needed to go back to procurement, who held\\nthe decision-rights! Many sales deals in logistics services are $50M+,\\nand these decisions are made carefully and with a great deal of due\\ndiligence. There is often a ‘tactical” element to the procurement pro-\\ncess, especially with the advent of RFQ tools such as those in pro-\\ncurement systems such as SAP. These processes often result in im-\\npersonal interactions, and value-based relationships may be damaged in\\nthe process.\\n\\n\\nIn mature procurement organizations, there is a common and\\naligned view of the supply base that is consistently communicated and\\nemphasized in all business transactions. An example of a typical “seg-\\nmentation” view of the supply base will be a tiered structure, whereby\\nTier 1 suppliers are viewed as strategic partners. If you are in a tier 1,\\nyou are viewed as a strategic resource, who acts as a trusted advisor to\\ndeliver business value and promote organizational objectives. There are\\ntypically only a handful of suppliers who are in this role in most or-\\nganizations. Tier 2 suppliers are strategic, but do not have access to the\\nsame regular performance reviews and in-depth senior executive en-\\ngagements. Tier 3 suppliers are primarily working with local business\\nrelationships, while Tier 4 are purely transactional. In terms of logistics\\nproviders, a Tier 4 is viewed as someone who provides labor and no\\nother value.\\n\\n\\nIt is important for the sales organization to understand how they are\\nviewed by procurement in this context, as a number of assumptions on\\nhow procurement will work with you as a sales organization will follow\\nfrom this perception. However, it is also important for the sales orga-\\nnization to recognize how procurement views them as well!\\n\\n\\nThe final shift is related to the increased responsibilities being ac-\\ncrued by sellers as a function of increased outsourcing.\\n\\n\\n6. Shift 3: increased reliance on partners for innovation\\n\\n\\n6.1. Innovation requires dependence\\n\\n\\nIn the prior study by Handfield and Bechtel (2002), the model\\npredicted that buyers who feel that they are dependent on suppliers,\\nwill likely lead to development of more formal contracts to mitigate\\nrisk, reduced levels of trust, and generally speaking deteriorating per-\\nformance in supplier responsiveness. Our data suggested that more\\nformal contracts were indeed more likely to be used, and responsive-\\nness was also likely to decline. Since this period, several changes have\\nled to major shifts in these proposed relationships. These changes are\\nshown in Table 3.\\n\\n\\nIt is difficult for one firm to possess all of the resources, knowledge\\nand capabilities required to sustain existing technological capabilities,\\nwhile at the same time, to build new ones (Dyer & Singh, 1998; Sarkar,\\nEchambadi, Cavusgil, & Aulakh, 2001). Thus, sharing “breakthrough”\\nknowledge with their supply base provides an opportunity to enable\\nsupply chain partners to help make sense out of ambiguous and un-\\ncertain information about the environment.\\n\\n\\n6.2. Human Asset specificity promotes technology development\\n\\n\\nStrong in-house technological proficiency also provides an avenue\\n\\n\\nR. Handfield Industrial Marketing Management 83 (2019) 194–206\\n\\n\\n203\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfor identifying and valuing information received from the environment.\\nEven where the primary source of technology is external, the firm needs\\nstrong internal capabilities to evaluate the external information and to\\nintegrate it into internal operations (Cousins et al., 2006). However, as\\npreviously stated, many firms are also increasingly reliant on their\\nsuppliers to help process this information. The role of supply manage-\\nment in driving improvements in product development performance\\nhas received increasing attention (Handfield et al., 1999; Monczka,\\nHandfield, Frayer, Ragatz, & Scannell, 1999; Peterson et al., 2005).\\n\\n\\n6.3. Socialization breeds trust\\n\\n\\nSuccessful inter-organizational product development is also depen-\\ndent on the partner's ability to manage, maintain and create knowledge\\n(Cohee, Barrows, & Handfield, 2018; Cohen & Levinthal, 1990). So-\\ncialization between the buyer and seller will become a much more\\nimportant factor, and has been shown to impact both the absorptive\\ncapacity of the buyer, as well as their level of innovation (Cousins et al.,\\n2009; Peterson et al., 2005). As innovation is often shared across firm\\nboundaries, the investigation of how knowledge is acquired and\\ntransferred between buyer and supplier represents an important em-\\npirical question (Ahuja, 2000; Argote, McEvily, & Reagans, 2003).\\nInter-organizational product development requires more extensive co-\\nordination and management than traditional intra-firm development\\nand presents its own set of unique difficulties; such as how to manage\\nappropriation concerns and establish trust with the partner company\\n(Bstieler, 2006; Littler, Leverick, & Bruce, 1995). In this sense, re-\\nlationship commitment is a key to building inter-organizational\\nlearning agility (Carmeli, Zivan, Gomes, & Markman, 2017). Despite\\nthese additional challenges, sharing knowledge with suppliers can often\\nhelp in problem solving, making design and cost trade-offs, improving\\nmanufacturability and producing a higher level of quality (Takeishi,\\n2001).\\n\\n\\nThese insights lead us to the following proposition:\\n\\n\\nProposition 3. Increased digitization will provide competitive\\nopportunities for suppliers to provide digital innovation, that and\\ndifferentiate value through analytics as a service in emerging business\\nmodels, and create opportunities for multi-tier integration.\\n\\n\\nThe need for direct engagement is one of the most important com-\\nponents of new product development and innovation (Chowdhury,\\nJayaram, & Prajogo, 2017; Monczka et al., 1999). The emerging digital\\nenvironment provides an opportunity for creating value that is un-\\nparalleled in the current environment. For new customers, sales per-\\nsonnel have an opportunity to promote digital innovation by ensuring\\nthat they remain on the forefront of a purchasing organization's en-\\nvironmental scans, even if they are not a current customer. This may\\ninvolve engagement in trade shows, technical presentations, and so-\\ncialization mechanisms that provide a venue for procurement to learn\\n\\n\\nmore about what the art of the possible may be, even if the technology\\nis not immediately applicable. Organizations are more interested in\\nidentifying partners for inclusion on their technology roadmaps\\n(Handfield et al., 1999; Handfield et al., 2003). Cousins et al. (2009)\\nargue that firms who actively scan their environment for breakthrough\\ntechnologies will be more successful at integrating and disseminating\\nknowledge within new product development. Knowledge management\\nis a matter of “connecting people so they can think together”\\n(McDermott & O'Dell, 2001: 104). While the effectiveness of the\\nknowledge management process largely depends on how well a com-\\npany manages its resources, assistance from supply managers in ex-\\ntending the reach of knowledge acquisition back into the supply base is\\na critical component for success. Intellectual capital and understanding\\nbusiness needs can lead to innovative digital solutions that will tie the\\nbusiness with data to drive improved end to end supply chain im-\\nprovements. As one supply manager we interviewed stated, “accessing\\nthe knowledge in the heads of 10,000 people in the supply base to improve\\nyour product and come up with new ideas is surely an asset worth working\\nfor!” (Chick & Handfield, 2014).\\n\\n\\n7. Conclusions\\n\\n\\nIn our prior study, we were concerned with the level to which\\ncompanies established site-specific assets ensure access and facilitate\\nrelationships between buying and selling organizations. As more in-\\ndustries such as automotive, electronics, life sciences and apparel\\nsource from low cost countries that are distant from one another, ex-\\necutives are increasingly aware of the potential risks of supply chain\\ndisruption, as well as brand risks, that exist. As suppliers and customers\\ngrow closer, the need to meet more often, to work through contentious\\nissues, has become critical in management of supply chain flows. One of\\nthe barriers that has arisen is the increasing distance between buyers\\nand sellers, as outsourcing has continued to grow. This is particularly\\nthe case as procurement has outsourced to “Low Cost Countries” in\\ntheir pursuit of lower costs.\\n\\n\\nOur updated insights on the current state of buyer-seller relation-\\nships suggest that the need for personal relationships may be on the\\nrise. As noted in our propositions, inter-organizational relationships\\nwill require greater engagement with multiple stakeholders, and whe-\\nther these occur virtually or in-person, the personalities and relation-\\nships that emerge will matter. For example, multiple teams of people\\nmay not be reviewing data in real-time, and conducting more frequent\\nperformance reviews. This may include multiple stakeholders, and may\\ncomplicate the governance of these relationships as different parties\\nneed to come to a resolution on how to address different situations,\\nwhen each has a different point of view on how to achieve this. The role\\nof buyers will also increase, as they may require more frequent meet-\\nings, particularly around new product initiatives and new product roll-\\nouts. All of this will require a new type of seller, one who has strong\\n\\n\\nTable 3\\nHandfield and Bechtel (2002) in light of shifts in product innovation.\\n\\n\\nHypotheses Relationship Shift: shared risks and rewards in product innovation Predictions/possible impacts\\n\\n\\nBuyer dependence → Formal\\ncontracts,\\nTrust\\nResponsiveness\\n\\n\\n+*\\nn.s.\\n-**\\n\\n\\n• Joint investment in new technologies is key\\n• Technology sharing and co-development leads to greater\\n\\n\\ntrust\\n\\n\\n• Less reliance on contracts due to fuzzy nature of\\noutcomes and deliverables\\n\\n\\n• Project review frequency will become key\\nFormal contracts → Trust n.s. • IP and trust issues often conflict\\n\\n\\n• Trust grows as a function of interpersonal familiarity, but can\\nchange with different personnel\\n\\n\\n• Establishing governance mechanisms to manage\\ninformation sharing will be key\\n\\n\\nSite specific assets → Trust\\nHuman assets\\n\\n\\n+*\\n+**\\n\\n\\n• Outsourcing to diverse regions results in cultural\\nmisunderstanding on NPD teams\\n\\n\\n• Local presence on NPD development teams will be\\nkey\\n\\n\\nHuman assets→ Trust\\nResponsiveness\\n\\n\\nn.s.\\nn.s.\\n\\n\\n• Outsourcing to diverse regions results in cultural\\nmisunderstanding on NPD teams\\n\\n\\n• Local presence on NPD development teams will be\\nkey\\n\\n\\nTrust → Responsiveness +** • Engineering in buyers are often adversely influenced to share\\ninformation with suppliers\\n\\n\\n• Defined roles and mutual expectations for parties\\nwill become critical for success\\n\\n\\nR.

The emergence of a single provider with analytical insights\\ncollected from multiple enterprises, leading to a transparent and un-\\nbiased role, is one that is very much new to the research, and which\\ncauses a great deal of discomfort in many parties, will need to be ad-\\ndress. The role of trust verified by data will become much more im-\\nportant in this context.\\n\\n\\nAs a result of these shifts, despite the move towards digitization of\\nsupply chains, we may start to see companies move closer together. In\\nfact, the emerging practice of “localization” is being driven by the re-\\ncent wave towards increased tariffs and protectionism. Organizations\\nare starting to realize they need to “buy where they sell, and sell where\\nthey buy”, which may involve establishing local suppliers to meet local\\ncontent requirements, and avoid tariffs, customs, duties, and other fines\\n(Handfield & Linton, 2017). Long lead times are another characteristic\\nof global sources, and this often involves establishing large inventory\\nbuffers to deal with them. In a world where speed and velocity is im-\\nperative, localization is starting to look a lot more appealing! The push\\ntowards localization thus leads us to propose that buyer-seller re-\\nlationships may again be on the rise, (albeit spanning multiple parties),\\nin an era where the benefits of true globalization are under threat.\\n\\n\\nIn our prior paper in 2002, there seemed to be no relationship be-\\ntween contracts and trust. In fact, contracts were found to somewhat\\nget in the way of creating trust. In the past eighteen years, we have seen\\na significant improvement in the ability of organizations to create im-\\nproved contracts, that are able to better navigate the uncertainties that\\nexist. One of the most important elements is that more stakeholders are\\ninvolved in the contracting process upfront, as we identified in this\\npaper. We believe that in case of joint technology development, this\\nwill also become more important, especially with the entrance of new\\ndigital providers in the supply chain who will become embedded in the\\nphysical supply chains. In tandem with procurement having more sta-\\nkeholders to consider, sales should also be aware that multiple forms of\\nvalue need to be produced through analytics as a service, and explore\\nnew contractual mechanisms for doing so.\\n\\n\\nIn addressing this question, it is important for the sales team to be\\nable to quantify the elements of value and in this case, educate the\\ncustomer. In some cases, the procurement organization may not have a\\nfull level of understanding regarding the different forms of performance\\nand value that a third party outsourced provider is can deliver to their\\nbusiness. In the evolving ecosystem that is unfolding with digital\\ntransformation, new roles for buyers and sellers will undoubtedly prove\\nto be a rich area for future industrial marketing research.\\n\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n\\nAcito, F., & Khatri, V.
