The smart manufacturing systems (SMS) offer several advantages compared to the traditional manufacturing 
systems and are increasingly being adopted by manufacturing organizations as a strategy to improve their 
performance. Developing an SMS is expensive and complicated, integrating together various technologies such as 
automation, data exchanges, cyber-physical systems (CPS), artificial intelligence, internet of things (IoT), and 
semi-autonomous industrial systems. The Small, Medium and Micro Enterprises (SMMEs) have limited resources 
and therefore, would like to see the benefits from investments before allowing adopting SMS. This study uses a 
combination of exploratory and empirical research design to identify and validate the performance measures 
relevant to the evaluation of SMS investments in auto-component manufacturing SMMEs based in India. The 
study found that an Industry 4.0 enabled SMS offer more competitive benefits compared to a traditional 
manufacturing system. The planned investments in SMS can be evaluated on ten performance dimensions 
namely, cost, quality, flexibility, time, integration, optimized productivity, real-time diagnosis & prognosis, 
computing, social and ecological sustainability. Proposed novel Smart Manufacturing Performance Measurement 
System (SMPMS) framework is expected to guide the practitioners in SMMEs to evaluate their SMS investments.   


1. Introduction 


Small, Medium and Micro enterprises (SMMEs) have helped to 
accelerate economic development in Asia (Ndubisi et al., 2020). Along 
with the large enterprises, they are also adopting Industry 4.0 technol-
ogies for improved performance. Industry 4.0 is the latest trend in the 
manufacturing technologies that transform the existing manufacturing 
systems to Smart Manufacturing Systems (SMS) through the support of 
automation, data exchanges, cyber-physical systems (CPS), cloud 
computing, robotics, big data, artificial intelligence, internet of things 
(IoT) and semi-autonomous industrial techniques (Kamble et al., 
2018a). The manufacturing goals achieved by the Industry 4.0 lies in the 
intersection of people, technologies and innovation. With tremendous 
development in the field of manufacturing and data analytics technol-
ogies (Zhang et al., 2019; Qu et al., 2019). Much of these developments 
are focused on digital manufacturing systems and artificial intelligence 
techniques, transforming the systems to become smart and intelligent 


(Edgar and Pistikopoulos, 2018). The SMS generates a considerable 
amount of data; however, the use and volume of the data collected vary 
across the industries, their scale, and operations (Kusiak, 2019). 


Zheng et al. (2018) identified significant applications of SMS in 
design, machining, monitoring, control and scheduling. The use of 
computer-aided design and manufacturing software, immersive and 
non-invasive hybrid prototyping technologies-such as augmented reality 
(AR) and visual reality (VR) and the ability to interact within the 
cyber-physical systems in a manufacturing environment help companies 
to establish smart design architectures (Kamble et al., 2018a). The SMS 
eliminates the need for post-process quality inspections and enables a 
self-optimization control system with the use of sensors, IoT, machine 
learning and cloud computing technologies (Stoyanov et al., 2019). The 
deployment of IoT provides SMS the capability for real-time monitoring 
and control, resulting in the improved quality of operations, reduction in 
product and machine failures and development of optimal schedules (He 
et al., 2019; Liang et al., 2019).

Several organizations are implementing Industry 4.0 technologies to 
address the challenges of increasing manufacturing complexity (Oh and 
Jeong, 2019). The real-time based technologies transform the reactive 
operational approach of the manufacturing facilities into a proactive 
approach (Davis et al., 2012). Jung et al. (2015) report that for the SMS 
to be efficient, they need to be able to respond to the information quickly 
and effectively, and in the process may disrupt the ongoing operations. 


The SMS need to be agile and able to meet the rigorous performance 
requirements to become successful in achieving their implementation 
goals. No doubt that the implementation of SMS in the SMMEs will in-
crease the production activities, but would also result in complex 
operational issues, with concerns for the economic, environment, social 
and resource sustainability (Ndubisi et al., 2020). The literature suggest 
that even though Industry 4.0 has demonstrated significant potential in 
value creation and digital supply chain transformation, the scholarly 
research emphasizing the significance of Industry 4.0 on the 
manufacturing supply chain is still embryonic and the sustainability 
issues has received little attention (Büyük€ozkan and G€oçer, 2018). 


The performance measurement of SMS is one of the most critical 
issues from the managerial viewpoint. The development of an SMS re-
quires support from different supply chain partners in terms of collab-
oration, human resources, coordination, organizational and 
technological capabilities (Kamble et al., 2020c). Further, with the 
implementation of SMS, the SMMEs will expect improvements in the 
areas of productivity, integration, transparency, flexibility and profit-
ability (Ndubisi et al., 2020). To ensure that the SMS will pursue those 
aspects, a performance measurement system plays a vital role in sys-
tematic management (Kamble and Gunasekaran, 2020). However, the 
research in SMS performance measurement is largely scarce. In the past, 
there have been numerous studies in the literature to identify and collate 
performance measures to evaluate supply chain performance. These 
studies classified the performance measures as; ‘qualitative’ or ‘quanti-
tative’ (Beamon, 1999; Shepherd and Günter, 2006); ‘cost’ or ‘non-cost’ 
(Gunasekaran et al., 2001), ‘quality,’ ‘cost,’ ‘delivery,’ ‘flexibility,’ 
‘strategic,’ ‘operational’ or ‘tactical’ (Shepherd and Günter, 2006). Few 
studies classified the measures based on ‘resource utilization,’ ‘visibility, 
’ ‘trust,’ and ‘innovativeness’ (Chan, 2003) and ‘supply chain opera-
tional reference’ framework (Lockamy and McCormack, 2004). 


Continuous review of the performance measures is required to be 
undertaken, as they keep changing with the developments in the 
competitive environment; hence, making the design, development and 
implementation of the performance measurement system a continuous 
process and not a one-time activity (Beamon, 1999; Kamble and Guna-
sekaran, 2020). In traditional manufacturing systems, the performance 
measurement systems are based on historical information that is isolated 
and static (Lapide, 2010). The SMS are highly proactive with the capa-
bility to collect information that is fast-changing and highly volatile. 
Hence, the decision-makers will be interested in anticipating future 
performance instead of reacting to problems that occurred in the past 
(Stefanovic, 2015). Researchers have highlighted the need for studies on 
performance measurement in the changing context of Industry 4.0 and 
smart manufacturing systems (Frederico et al. 2019, 2020; Kamble et al., 
2018a; Ghadge et al., 2020). 


Few research studies have proposed a performance measurement 
framework for Industry 4.0 based manufacturing systems (Shin et al., 
2018; Miragliotta et al., 2018; Bauters et al., 2018; Ante et al., 2018; 
Emmer et al., 2018). However, the proposed performance measures in 
these studies are limited to the evaluation of a specific performance 
dimension; such as data quality, productivity or product quality. 
Moreover, these studies used literature reviews or case study approaches 
and lack in providing empirical validity for the measures. There is a need 
to conduct empirical studies seeking practitioners’ views on the ade-
quacy and applicability of performance dimensions in the Industry 4.0 
context (Frederico et al., 2020). Thus, a significant knowledge gap is 
evident in developing a holistic performance measurement system for 
SMS within the context of Industry 4.0. Accordingly, this paper aims to 


address the research gap in the literature by identifying the performance 
measures using a combination of literature review and empirical vali-
dation. The empirical validation in this study is performed on selected 
Industry practitioners from SMMEs in India. This is relevant considering 
the substantial investment costs in implementing Industry 4.0 based 
SMS and the limited financing options available to the SMMEs 
(Gawankar et al., 2020; Kiel et al., 2017a, 2017b). The SMMEs would 
prefer to apply SMS in gradual steps and see the results before pro-
ceeding further with holistic implementation. The contribution of 
SMMEs towards a country’s economic and social development is high 
(Ndubisi et al., 2020), and SMS implementation will provide a consid-
erable stimulus for the nation’s growth. The performance measures 
identified in this study are expected to support and foster the speed of 
Industry 4.0 enabled SMS implementation in SMMEs. More specifically, 
the following research questions (RQ) were addressed in this study. 


RQ1. What performance measures can be used to evaluate the per-
formance of SMS in SMMEs? 


RQ2. How can these measures be used to evaluate the SMS perfor-
mance in SMMEs? 


The study uses a three-phase research methodology to seek answers 
to the above research questions. Phase-I used a literature review to 
identify the performance measures in the context of SMS. In phase-II, a 
preliminary survey was conducted in 142 auto-component 
manufacturing SMMEs to explore the possible underlying factor struc-
ture of the performance measures. The final study was conducted in 
Phase-III on 254 practitioners from 180 auto-component manufacturing 
SMMEs to validate the factor structure of performance measures iden-
tified in Phase-II. A Smart Manufacturing Performance Measurement 
System (SMPMS) framework is developed based on the findings of the 
study, which will guide the practitioners in the SMMEs on how to 
evaluate the SMS performance. 


The remaining of the paper is structured as follows; section two 
presents the conceptual background of the study and relevant literature 
review on performance measures in SMS. The third section discusses the 
three-phase research methodology adopted in this study. The results of 
the study are presented in the fourth section. The fifth section offers the 
discussions and implications of the study. The SMPMS framework is 
discussed in section six. Finally, in the sixth section, conclusions with 
future research possibilities and limitations are discussed. 


2. The conceptual background of the study 


2.1. Overview of SMMEs in India 


The estimated market growth driven by SMAC (social, mobile, ana-
lytics, and cloud) is expected to be 30% (US$1 trillion) by 2020 
(NASSCOM, 2018). The SMMEs will play a leading role in the adoption 
of SMAC to bring operational efficiency and transform the customer 
experience. The SMMEs are continually looking forward to enhancing 
their competitiveness by adopting Industry 4.0 technologies (Mashelkar, 
2018). There exists a significant economic potential for the SMMEs to 
transform into smart factories, integrating information communication 
technologies (ICT) and CPS with manufacturing, logistics, and supply 
chain planning (Lee and Lapira, 2013; Ndubisi et al., 2020). In India, the 
SMMEs are the major contributors to industrial development, with a 
share of 40% in industrial production and 35% of the total manufactured 
exports (Mathur, 2019). The literature identifies pressure on SMMEs to 
achieve continuous quality improvements, extensive manual in-
terventions in processes, interrupted data flow and lack of skilled 
workforce as the critical barriers for implementing Industry 4.0 tech-
nologies (Kamble et al., 2018b). The Government of India is supporting 
the SMMEs to develop SMS through various initiatives such as ‘Make in 
India,’ ‘Technological up-gradation,’ and ‘Establishment of facilitation cen-
ters.’ The government is in the process of developing a regulatory

framework that is more conducive for enabling an Industry 4.0 
ecosystem in the country (KPMG-AIMA, 2018). 


In India, the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are 
classified in two classes as per the provision of the MSMEs Development 
Act, 2006 of the Government of India. The first class pertains to the 
“enterprises that are engaged in the manufacturing or production of goods or 
employing plant and machinery in the process of value addition to the final 
product having a distinct name or character or use” (Ministry of MSME, 
2019). The second class includes the “enterprises engaged in providing or 
rendering of services and are defined in terms of investment in equipment” 
(Ministry of MSME, 2019). The limit of investments that are used to 
categorize these enterprises into micro, small and medium categories is 
presented in Table 1. 


In spite of several benefits offered by the Industry 4.0 technologies, 
very few SMMEs can afford the smart manufacturing solutions. The ICT 
based technology adoption in the Indian SMMEs can be described in four 
stages. Stage 1 includes organizations that have a basic level of tech-
nology for communication and data processing. In stage 2, the organi-
zations use standalone software to execute functional tasks without any 
cross-functional interactions or linkages. For e.g., the use of accounting 
software to generate profit and loss statements. In the third stage, the 
organizations use enterprise resource planning applications to automate 
and integrate their core business functions. The fourth stage represents 
the highest level of technological maturity with the SMMEs using digital 
networks and real-time decision-making systems. The organizations in 
this stage are willing to invest in innovative IT solutions to enhance their 
value chain integration (Ndubisi, 2008; Ndubisi et al., 2020). 


The present status of SMMEs in India reveals that medium-sector 
enterprises have more matured technology than micro and small-scale 
enterprises (Mathur, 2019). The huge upfront investment cost in tech-
nology is identified as a significant barrier to SMS adoption (Kamble 
et al., 2018b). Understandably, the SMMEs prefers to invest in such 
systems using a step-by-step approach as these SMMEs are constrained 
with the budget and, therefore, would see the benefits from the in-
vestments before allowing their management, customers, and em-
ployees to adopt the technology (Ndubisi, 2008). Thus, the focus of this 
study is to provide a validated set of performance measures and a per-
formance measurement system for the SMMEs to manage successful SMS 
implementation. 


2.2. Performance measures in traditional manufacturing systems 


Performance measurement is defined as “the process of quantifying the 
efficiency and effectiveness of action” (Neely et al., 1995). The perfor-
mance measures should support improving organizational performance 
and create a supportive work environment (Bititci et al., 2005). Majority 
of the previous studies have developed performance measures and 
metrics for overall supply chain management (Gunasekaran et al., 2001; 
Bititci et al., 2005; Shepherd and Günter, 2006). Although these studies 
offered some performance measures for manufacturing systems, the 
primary focus of these studies was supply chain performance measures. 


The measurement of manufacturing performance is a challenging 
task because of the diverse and multi-dimensional nature of 
manufacturing. Hon (2005) conducted a survey to identify widely used 
performance measures in the aerospace industry. The measures were 
classified into five dimensions, namely, cost, quality, flexibility, time 


and productivity. The study identified that most of the organizations 
used overall lead-time, on-time delivery, operating costs, inventory 
level, and scrap rate as relevant measures along with quality. Diego 
Fernando and Rivera Cadavid (2007) combined various metrics 
consistent with the different stages and elements of lean manufacturing. 
They classified 21 performance metrics in six categories that included 
elimination of waste, continuous improvement, continuous flow, pull 
driven system, multifunctional teams, and information systems. The 
high investment and operating costs in developing automated 
manufacturing systems required many organizations to consider Overall 
Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) as one of the critical metrics in perfor-
mance measurement (Mathur et al., 2011). The maintenance perfor-
mance measures, such as condition-based maintenance and 
reliability-centered maintenance were found to create value for the or-
ganizations (Kumar et al., 2013). While classifying 73 measures into 
twelve performance dimensions, Gosselin (2005) found that 
manufacturing organizations prefer financial measures over the 
non-financial measures (Gosselin, 2005). Kamble and Gunasekaran 
(2020) conducted a study in the context of the big data-driven supply 
chain, identifying new measures such as predictive quality, real-time 
fault-finding and predictive machine failure to evaluate the 
manufacturing systems. The study highlighted that the predictive ana-
lytics capability of data-driven manufacturing supply chains provides 
organizations the ability to proactively plan for, what may occur in the 
future instead of analysing the reasons for what has happened in the 
past. 


The measurement systems should be dynamic and align 
manufacturing strategy to drive competitive and innovative perfor-
mance (Hon, 2005). The above discussions suggest that the performance 
measures have evolved with the changing environment, and the recent 
advancements in the Industry 4.0 technologies are offering new possi-
bilities to monitor and control performance in real-time. This justifies 
the need to review and validate relevant performance measures for the 
SMS. 


2.3. Performance measures for smart manufacturing systems 


2.3.1. Cost measures 
The literature reveals that the reduction in manufacturing costs is 


one of the critical focus of SMS. The performance measures used to 
demonstrate the benefits of SMS are general cost measures that are used 
in the traditional manufacturing systems and included profit (Pistolesi 
et al., 2018; Roy et al., 2015), work-in-process cost (Fan et al., 2019), 
energy cost (Gadaleta et al., 2019; Edgar and Pistikopoulos, 2018), 
maintenance cost (Vogl et al., 2019), waste treatment cost (Santos et al., 
2019) and inventory cost (Chen and Kuo, 2019; Castellano et al., 2019). 
Most of the above studies compared the SMS performance with the 
traditional manufacturing systems on the cost measures and claimed 
that an SMS performs far better than a conventional manufacturing 
system offering higher cost-saving benefits (Alqahtani et al., 2019; 
Gadaleta et al., 2019). 


2.3.2. Quality measures 
The use of information and communication technologies such as IoT, 


machine learning and predictive analytics enable SMS to perform real- 
time monitoring and proactive control of the products, processes and 
equipment. The predictive capability of SMS makes them superior to the 
traditional manufacturing systems, enabling the SMS to detect product 
failure in real-time (He et al., 2019; Liang et al., 2019), predict the 
remaining useful life of the machine (Kumar et al., 2019; He et al., 
2019), early process fault detection (Carvajal Soto et al., 2019) and 
process visualizations (Qian et al., 2019). Further, the SMS performs 
efficiently on the measures of warranty claims by the customers 
(Alqahtani et al., 2019), reduced scrap (Chauhan et al., 2019; Rajput and 
Singh, 2019), the defective product (Kucukoglu et al., 2018; Kang et al., 
2018) and inspection errors (Kang et al., 2018; Uva et al., 2018). The

SMS promotes supply chain integration by developing the superior 
quality of supplier relationships, collaborative partnerships (Longo 
et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019b) and improved customer satisfaction 
(Petrillo et al., 2019). 


2.3.3. Computing measures 
The Industry 4.0 technologies and architectures are required to 


connect and extend the physical factory operations with the cyber world 
needing greater information consistency, data reliability, information 
privacy and security (O’Donovan et al., 2019). Zhao et al. (2019) suggest 
the use of advanced ICT and IoT for effective implementation of SMS for 
improved product traceability and information security. Data storage 
capacity, lack of human skills, information privacy and high latency are 
significant challenges that affect the performance of an SMS (Li et al., 
2019). The highly secured network is identified as a critical requirement 
for managing the human-robot collaboration in enhancing SMS perfor-
mance (Khalid et al., 2018). Hence, for the efficient performance of SMS, 
it is critical to have a reliable data management system that includes 
data collection, data transfer, data storage and data analytical 
capabilities. 


2.3.4. Human measures 
The impact of technological advancements on the human resources 


have also received attention in the literature (Pinzone et al., 2019; 
Eimontaite et al., 2019; Kamble et al., 2020c; Tortorella et al., 2020). 
Pinzone et al. (2019) suggest that SMS supports building a robust social 
environment enabling improved employee health, learning and opera-
tive performance. The technologies such as virtual and augmented re-
ality accelerate employee learning, thus reducing the work pressure and 
increase in morale (Uva et al., 2018; Kamble et al., 2018a, 2018b; 
Blanco-Novoa et al., 2018). The other human factors on which the SMS 
performance could be evaluated are reduced human efforts & anxiety, 
improved working conditions and non-invasive interventions (Kamble 
et al., 2018a, 2018b; Roldan et al., 2019; Eimontaite et al., 2019). The 
above studies suggest that the SMS support in developing a 
human-friendly environment by not only offering improved physical 
comfort, but also relieving the psychological stress on the employees. 


2.3.5. Productivity measures 
SMS encourages the use of advanced optimization and simulation 


techniques because of the availability of a considerable amount of data 
that is generated in real-time at different locations in the manufacturing 
supply chains. The literature reveals that the prescriptive analytical 
techniques have been deployed extensively in SMS to optimize the 
machining processes (Liang et al., 2019; Zhao et al., 2019; Biondi et al., 
2017), plant and warehouse layouts (B�anyai et al., 2019; Peruzzini et al., 
2019), use of materials (Chauhan et al., 2019; Meng et al., 2018), 
workstation design (Pistolesi et al., 2018) and workflows (Tufano et al., 
2018). Compared to the conventional manufacturing systems, the pro-
ductivity measures in the SMS relies more on the use of optimization and 
simulation techniques to make the operations productive. 


2.3.6. Flexibility measures 
In the traditional manufacturing systems, flexibility is evaluated on 


various performance measures that include the system flexibility in 
terms of product mix, delivery, process, machine, and volume. However, 
SMS extends these flexibility performance measures to include the 
ability to execute real-time job scheduling (Saif et al., 2019; Fan et al., 
2019; Framinan et al., 2019) real-time design and engineering changes 
(Davis et al., 2012), real-time monitoring of customer orders (Qu et al., 
2019; Petrillo et al., 2019), and real-time supply status of products 
(Longo et al., 2019; Oh and Jeong, 2019). Hence, the SMS performs 
efficiently on providing real-time flexibility to the manufacturing or-
ganizations, enabling them to make real-time decisions on various as-
pects such as interaction with the suppliers, internal customers, and the 
end customers. 


The list of performance measures reviewed from the literature on 
SMS is summarised in Table 2. The dimensions used for classification of 
these measures were based on existing classification schemes used in the 
literature and the discussion with the industry practitioners from the 
auto-component manufacturing SMMEs. 


2.4. Performance measurement of smart manufacturing systems 


The research on performance measurement systems for Industry 4.0 
is scarce, with limited research studies attempting to develop evaluation 
systems for smart manufacturing projects in Industry 4.0 (Ante et al., 
2018). Ante et al. (2018) proposed a performance management system 
for lean production system in the automotive industry in the Industry 4.0 
context. Emmer et al. (2018) proposed a comprehensive measurement 
data management (MDM) system focused on the technological re-
quirements of Industry 4.0 for complex process chains. The proposed 
framework integrated the flow of information within quality assurance 
using neutral data formats and achieved comprehensive interoperability 
of the individual system components. Miragliotta et al. (2018) identified 
the need to measure data productivity in the context of Industry 4.0. 
Inspired by the traditional OEE framework, the data measurement 
model measures data productivity on the performance dimensions of 
data availability, quality and decision-making process. The performance 
measurement model developed by Shin et al. (2018) evaluated the 
quality aspects of an organization in the context of Industry 4.0. The 
framework used the existing performance measures regarding the costs 
of quality items and developed a virtual tool to assess weaknesses in the 
current manufacturing systems. Frederico et al. (2019) developed a 
performance measurement system for Industry 4.0 based supply chains 
using the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) framework. 


Although above discussed studies in the literature have attempted to 
establish measurement systems in the Industry 4.0 context, the measures 
considered by them are not comprehensive and directed towards a 
specific performance dimension. Further, these studies have used con-
ceptual frameworks or case studies within the organization to develop 
the measurement system, lacking empirical validation of the identified 
measures. 


3. Research methodology 


A three-phase research methodology with a combination of explor-
atory and empirical investigations was adopted to propose a validated 
set of measures and to evaluate the SMS performance in SMMEs. As 
shown in Fig. 1, phase one of the study was aimed at the development of 
the measurement items and establish content validity. An extant liter-
ature review and interview with the industry practitioners were con-
ducted in this phase (Flynn et al., 1990). Phase two used a preliminary 
survey to explore possible underlying factor structure of the perfor-
mance measures identified in phase-I, to finalize the measurement items 
(Child, 1990; DeVellis, 1991). The factor structure of performance 
measures determined from Phase-II was validated in Phase III of the 
study. The investigation resulted in the development of a Smart 
Manufacturing Performance Measurement System (SMPMS) framework 
that can be used by the SMMEs practitioners to guide the SMS perfor-
mance in their organizations. 


3.1. Development of measurement instrument (Phase-I) 


3.1.1. Literature review 
The measurement items for the performance measures were devel-


oped using an extant literature review followed by an in-depth un-
structured discussion with the practitioners from the manufacturing 
industry. The discussions with the practitioners helped us to establish 
the content validity of the identified measures. Similar approaches were 
used in the previous studies focused on developing measurement items 
(Parasuraman et al., 1985; Peter et al., 1982). The literature search was

performed on the Scopus database using the keywords; “Smart 
manufacturing” and “Industry 4.0" and “Intelligent Manufacturing” and 
“Digital manufacturing” in pairwise comparison with “Performance mea-
surement” and “Performance management.” The initial search resulted in a 
total of 1469 papers, which was further reduced to 348 articles by 
limiting the search to papers published in academic journals in the 
subject categories: business management, operations management, de-
cision sciences, and computer/technology management. Those papers 
that did not align with the search objectives were not considered for 
further review. In the end, 98 research papers were selected for the final 
review. A summary of the chosen articles is presented in Appendix A. 


3.1.2. Content validity of performance measures 
Twenty-two in-depth interviews with industry participants were 


conducted using open-ended questions to validate the measures identi-
fied from the literature subjectively. The practitioners were selected 
from five Tier-I auto-component manufacturing organizations and had 
prior knowledge about SMS. Out of these five participating organiza-
tions, all of them are using sensor/IoT and cloud computing-based 
manufacturing systems, two of them have adopted additive 
manufacturing, and one of them is using virtual reality for training and 
maintenance activities. The practitioners represented different func-
tional backgrounds that included-manufacturing, maintenance, quality 
and utilities. The selected practitioners varied in experience levels and 
held managerial positions like- Vice-president, Chief Manager, Associate 
Manager, Manager, Director, etc. The practitioners were interviewed on 
a broad range of SMS performance measures (e.g., what measures they 
perceived to be necessary for evaluating SMS performance?, Are the 
performance measures used for traditional manufacturing systems 
relevant in Industry 4.0 environment?) Few measures were added and 
some dropped based on the recommendation of the practitioners. The 
final list of 102 measures was subjectively classified in seven perfor-
mance dimensions namely, cost, quality, productivity, flexibility, time, 
human and computing performance as presented in Table 2. 


3.2. Exploring the underlying factors of performance measures (phase II) 


In this phase, a preliminary study was conducted to establish the 
statistical validity of the measurement items identified from Phase I. 
Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was performed in this phase to 
determine the underlying performance dimensions and finalize the 
measurement items for use in the final survey. The data was collected 
through an online survey of 210 working practitioners from 142 auto- 
component manufacturers in India. The questionnaire for the second

phase of the study included 102 measures. Out of 102 measures, 52 were 
worded positively and 50 were worded negatively. A five-point Likert 
scale with the extreme values ranging from “Strongly Disagree” (1) to 
“Strongly Agree” (5) was developed and the respondents were asked 
about their agreement to what extent the measures could be used for the 
competitive benefits occurring from SMS investments. 


The list of measurement items with the literature source is presented 
in Table 2. 


The success of Indian SMMEs is driven by auto-component 
manufacturing companies because of its high technological maturity 
and massive development prospects. The auto-component industry 
contributes seven percent of India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), 
employing around 19 million people (Arcot, 2017). The auto-component 
industry is expected to achieve a turnover of USD 113 billion by 2020 
and become a significant manufacturing cluster in Asia (Smeventure, 
2017). A report by KPMG states that the Indian automotive industry has 
a high robot density of 58 robots/10000 employees compared to the 
industry density of just three robots/10000 employees (KPMG-AIMA, 
2018). Most of the Indian auto-component manufacturing organizations 
are in the process of adopting Industry 4.0 based SMS (Kamble et al., 
2020c). The potential of auto-component SMMEs and their gradual in-
terest in developing SMS ensured that the sample respondents are aware 
of the opportunities and challenges in developing SMS and qualified to 
participate in the survey. The online survey link was sent to 640 re-
spondents, and 210 completed responses were obtained (32.18% 
response rate) representing 142 SMMEs. The profile of the selected re-
spondents and SMMEs in the preliminary survey is shown in Table 3. 


3.3. Statistical validation of the factor structure of performance measures 


In this phase, the underlying factors from Phase II were used to 
conduct the final survey and confirm the factor structure of the perfor-
mance measures. The measurement items used in this survey were 
restricted to the underlying performance dimensions identified in Phase- 
II. A similar profile of respondents who participated in the second phase 
was approached for the survey. 254 respondents from 180 SMMEs 
participated in the online survey, which was coordinated by a local 
survey agency based in India. The design of the study required re-
spondents to answer all the questions before the final submission, 
eliminating the issue of the incomplete questionnaire and missing 
values. Similar sample sizes were used in the previous studies that 
empirically tested the effects of Industry 4.0 technologies on an orga-
nizational performance involving around 100 measurement items 
(Tortorella et al., 2020; Kamble et al., 2020c). The statistical analysis in 
the Phase I and II was performed after averaging the items with multiple 
responses from a single organization to obtain a single value for each 
item (Venkatraman and Grant, 1986). Hence, the effective sampling unit 
for analysis was the number of participating SMMEs. The profile of the 
selected respondents and SMMEs in the final survey is shown in Table 3. 


The measurement items were tested for convergent and discriminant 
validity using Composite Scale Reliability (CSR) and Average Variance 
Extracted (AVE) as per the suggested guidelines (Hair et al., 2014). CFA 
was used to validate the measurement model and model fit indices such 
as Chi-square value (χ2), degrees of freedom (df), Comparative Fit Index 
(CFI), Tuckers Lewis Index (TLI) and Root Mean Square Error of 
Approximation (RMSEA) was used as per the guidelines (Hu and Bentler, 
1999; Fan et al., 2016). 


4. Analysis and findings 


4.1. The underlying factors of performance measures 


The measures derived from the literature review exhibited some 
overlap across the different performance dimensions and showed a 
possibility of combining a few of them. This might be due to the 
exploratory nature of this phase and subjectivity of the experts while 


validating these measures. An EFA was conducted to overcome the 
subjectivity involved in identifying the performance and determine the 
underlying dimensions (Dick and Hagerty, 1971). 


4.1.1. Resolving the multi-dimensionality issues 
Skewness was used to measure the symmetry of data and Kurtosis to 


test whether the data are heavy-tailed or light-tailed relative to a normal 
distribution. The maximum absolute values for Skewness and Kurtosis 
were 1.139 (standard error of 0.181), and 2.564 (standard error of 
0.359) were within the permissible limits (Skewness < 2, Kurtosis <7) 
indicating that the data followed a normal distribution (Curran et al., 
1996). The possibility of multidimensionality of the performance mea-
sures imposed the need to compute Cronbach alpha (α) for all the seven 
dimensions separately. The α values helped to ascertain the measures 
that contributed to making up each dimension. The α values ranged from 
0.54 to 0.72. Selected measures from each dimension were dropped to 
improve the α values within the acceptable range (above 0.70) as per the 
guidelines suggested for the development of new measures (Hair et al., 
2014). An iterative procedure was used to increase the α values, deleting 
those measures with very low correlations and recomputing the new α 
values with a revised set of dimensions. The repeated procedure resulted 
in a set of 84 items, with the α values ranging between 0.76 and 0.94 
across the seven dimensions. 


The next step was to examine the dimensionality of the 86 perfor-
mance measures for which EFA with varimax rotation, constrained to a

fixed number of factors (seven), was used. The varimax rotation is found 
to maximize the squared factor loadings variations for each component, 
providing a linear transformation to components (Dillon and Goldstein, 
1984). No clear dimensions emerged from EFA as many of the items 
(performance measures) loaded simultaneously on several dimensions 
signifying that the measures overlapped or were dependent on each 
other. To overcome this problem, the EFA was re-run allowing the in-
tercorrelations among the dimensions by removing the fixed factor 
constraint. The EFA resulted in evolving a validated set of ten perfor-
mance dimensions re-assigning many of the measures from the previous 
dimensions. The inclusion of a performance measure in a dimension was 
made, if the factor loading score was above 0.5, ensuring that only the 
measures that contributed highly to the formation of a given factor were 
considered. The final list included 59 performance measures. The factor 
loading details of the 74 performance measures and their assigned 
dimension are presented in Table 3. As shown in Table 3, five of the 
seven dimensions developed in the first phase of the study-cost, time, 
flexibility, quality, and computing performance were retained with a 
reduced number of measures. Additionally, five new performance di-
mensions were evolved from the findings of the EFA viz., optimized 
productivity, integration, real-time diagnosis & prognosis, social and 
ecological sustainability. 


4.2. Validation of the factor structure of performance measures 


Although the EFA established the convergent validity of the mea-
surement items in Phase II; it was necessary to confirm the statistical 
significance of the measurement model involving 59 performance 
measures in 10 dimensions. The results presented in Table 5 indicated 
that the measurement items have no convergent validity concerns (CSR 
> 0.70, and AVE > 0.50). Further, for all the constructs the square root 
AVE was higher than the correlations between that specific construct, 
and all the other constructs indicating that the performance dimensions 
had no discriminant validity issues (Cooper and Zmud, 1990; Hair et al., 
2014). The CFA indicated a satisfactory model fit for the ten perfor-
mance dimensions with positive degrees of freedom ¼ 1280, χ2 ¼
3199.32, χ2/df ratio ¼ 2.49, CFI ¼ 0.912, TLI ¼ 0.897, and RMSEA ¼
0.081. All the above findings indicated that the identified performance 
dimensions were unidimensional. 


5. Discussion and implications 


This study presented relevant performance measures and a perfor-
mance measurement system that can be used for the assessment of SMS 
investments in SMMEs. The measures were identified using a combi-
nation of the exploratory and empirical validation process in the auto- 
component manufacturing sector. The study found that the SMMEs are 
convinced that the implementation of SMS will provide them with the 
competitive benefits of improved costs, quality, time, flexibility, opti-
mized productivity, real-time diagnosis and prognosis, computing per-
formance, integration, social, and ecological sustainability dimensions. 
SMS contributes to achieving improvements in the overall performance 
of the organization. Tortorella et al. (2020) identified that emerging 
technologies lead to an improvement in the quality of the products and 
customer service level satisfaction, thereby increasing the overall effi-
ciency of the organization. However, to achieve these benefits, organi-
zations are required to create an environment of learning and knowledge 
sharing. The present study statistically validated ten performance di-
mensions. These measures can be used by the practitioners to evaluate 
their SMS and build a performance-oriented manufacturing system. 


In this section, we first discuss the findings, including implications 
for theory and practice. Following this, a smart manufacturing perfor-
mance measurement system (SMPMS) is proposed which is expected to 
guide practitioners from the SMMEs to plan, measure, and control their 
SMS for the improved performance. 


5.1. Theoretical implications 


The SMMEs significantly contributes to the economic and regional 
development of a country. SMMEs are continually looking forward to 
enhancing their competitiveness by adopting innovative technological 
solutions. However, during the implementation of these technologies, 
SMMEs face issues related to economic, social, and ecological sustain-
ability that discourages them from proceeding with the investments. The 
previous studies in the literature have focused on identifying the 
implementation drivers and barriers of such technologies in SMMEs; 
however, they fail to provide a comprehensive system to guide and 
evaluate the implementation (Kamble et al., 2018a). The main contri-
bution of this study is to identify and develop a complete system that 
guides the implementation of Industry 4.0 enabled SMS in SMMEs. The 
Smart Manufacturing Performance Measurement System framework 
(presented below) is novel contribution of the study. The study extends 
the literature in two significant ways. Firstly, it contributes to the 
research of SMMEs by offering a performance measurement system that 
can be used to guide and evaluate the investments in innovative tech-
nologies such as Industry 4.0. Secondly, it extends the literature on In-
dustry 4.0 by identifying a set of empirically validated performance 
measures to evaluate SMS performance. It is expected that the findings 
of the study will lead to more focused research on innovative technology 
evaluations and investment opportunities in SMMEs. 


5.2. Managerial implications 


The ‘cost’ have been one of the critical performance criteria, which 
finds its origin from the discipline of cost accounting. This study found 
ten significant cost measures that are related to the productivity and 
efficiency of the organizations and provide a straightforward interpre-
tation of SMS performance. The quality measures focused on the 
objective parameters such as scrap, defects, and inspection quantities. 
The quality measures identified for evaluation of SMS investments were 
less in number compared to the conventional manufacturing systems, 
because SMS enables continuous monitoring and control of the products, 
processes and actors that lead to reduced quality issues. Although the 
exploratory study had identified twenty measures under the quality 
dimension, the empirical validation clustered many of these measures to 
form new dimensions such as real-time diagnosis & prognosis and 
optimized productivity, which were not observed in the previous 
studies. Similar findings were observed for the flexibility measures 
wherein only five out of eighteen measures identified in the exploratory 
phase were retained in the empirical validation. The measures in the 
optimized productivity dimension focused on the optimized use of re-
sources such as labor, materials and machines. 


The integration dimension evaluates the extent of influence SMS has 
on improved internal and external relationships. The finding implies 
that SMS should use a suitable IoT platform to integrate the suppliers, 
distributed manufacturing services, and manufacturing facilities to 
reduce the complicated manufacturing tasks. The IoT based SMS enables 
collaboration between the manufacturing services that are geographi-
cally distributed; and optimize the logistics routes on the dimensions of 
time, cost, and reliability (Wang et al., 2019b). The Industry 4.0 para-
digm supported by CPS offers the SMS promising capabilities leading to 
effective and flexible manufacturing. It is implied that to exploit the 
benefits of collaborative sharing and networked manufacturing re-
sources, the organizations should focus on automatic control of 
manufacturing equipment adaptively and effectively (Kamble et al., 
2018a). 


Blockchain technology is recommended for reducing information 
asymmetry, which has led to overcoming the issues of trust and 
collaboration among the supply chain partners (Longo et al., 2019; 
Kamble et al., 2020b). Blockchain adoption discourages counterfeiting 
of data and poor information quality, which have a negative influence 
on manufacturing performance. The use of blockchain, together with

other technologies such as IoT and big data, can provide manufacturing 
organizations the benefit of traceability, information security, and sus-
tainable manufacturing (Kamble et al., 2019a). However, for effective 
implementation of blockchain, the organizations will be required to 
overcome the barriers of information storage capacity and scalability, 
high cost of implementation, regulatory issues, and lack of skills (Zhao 
et al., 2019; Kamble et al., 2019a, 2019b). 


The Industry 4.0 technologies and architectures are expected to 
perform high on parameters of latency and reliability or resilience of 
cyber-physical interfaces. These interfaces support SMS applications 
required for data storage, analysis, and transfer (Zhou and Yao, 2017). 
The measures identified in the computing performance dimension im-
plies that the SMMEs should consider beyond cloud computing tech-
nology and consider the decentralized fog computing architectures to 
provide higher data consistency, reliability, privacy, and security 
(O’Donovan et al., 2019). Fog computing is found to be an efficient 
technology for enabling real-time monitoring and control, reducing the 
delay in transmitting the information, reduced energy consumption, 
improved memory utilization, and throughput (Wu et al., 2017). The 
SMMEs have to develop an efficient computing system to provide a high 
level of controllability and security from vulnerable cyber-attack (Khalid 
et al., 2018). Frameworks based on edge computing and artificial in-
telligence are found to improve the resource efficiency of computing 
services and improve the quality of diagnostic and prognostic perfor-
mance in SMS (Li et al., 2019). The SMMEs should consider moving 
some critical services and data from the centralized data server to the 
data source for enhanced computational efficiency (Yen et al., 2019) and 
consider use of proactive caching strategy in edge computing environ-
ment for improved goodput and real-time performance (Li et al., 2019). 


The results of the study also identified the need to evaluate SMS 
investments on the benefits of social and environmental sustainability. 
With the evolution of emerging technologies, the major challenge for 
organizations is to integrate people within the CPS. The finding implies 
that SMS must include the unique characteristics of the human labor and 
the CPS, addressing various scenarios of irregularities such as detection 
of machine failure or identification of process bottlenecks and guide the 
managers in developing human resource strategy (Fantini et al., 2018). 
Industry 4.0 capabilities offer an adaptive, continuous interaction be-
tween the operator and the machines improving operator safety, per-
formance, well-being, and satisfaction (Golan et al., 2019). The SMMEs 
should use immersive interface systems such as AR, VR based systems, 
process mining tools, and expert guidance received from the knowl-
edgeable workers to improve the performance of the product assemblies 
(Rold�an et al., 2019). The innovative virtual prototypes consisting of 
eye-tracking and wearable sensor devices are being developed for 
improved interactions between the workers and the digital factory. Such 
a human-machine interaction system should be formed by SMMEs to 
assist in the improvement and optimization of shop-floor operation, 
process workflow, workstation design, and layout (Peruzzini et al., 
2019). The other developments which should be considered by the 
MSMEs to improve work performance and reduce the worker’s anxiety 
include use of collaborative robots (Eimontaite et al., 2019), wearable 
digital assembly gloves to find defective products and processes using 
the vibrations and force values on the fingers ((Eimontaite et al., 2019). 


The emerging technologies provide an overload of environmental 
information to the SMMEs. The main challenge for the SMMEs is to 
select the relevant ecological data and relate it to the productivity of the 
organization (Santos et al., 2019). High consumption of energy acts as a 
critical barrier for the use of industrial robots in SMS, affecting the 
manufacturing process sustainability. It is, therefore, essential to reduce 
the energy efficiency of the robotic cell, maintaining high productivity 
levels and manufacturing quality (Gadaleta et al., 2019). SMMEs should 
realize the role played by IoT in analyzing the remaining life of the as-
sets, plan product warranty and maintenance schedules of the rema-
nufactured products (Alqahtani et al., 2019; Meng et al., 2018; Pistolesi 
et al., 2018). 


The twelve performance measures identified in the real-time diag-
nosis & prognosis dimension focused on proactive performance man-
agement. The study implies that the SMS has replaced most of the 
diagnostic analysis that is based on an off-line review, human inter-
vention, relying mainly on the past experience of the operator and 
knowledge on the known parameters (Lu et al., 2019). The SMS uses 
powerful data-driven prognosis techniques that are more agile and 
adaptable to complex situations (Bagheri et al., 2018; Jung et al., 2015; 
Kamble et al., 2020a). The SMMEs may consider the use of image pro-
cessing techniques to automate the observation and evaluation of the 
manufacturing process (Zhao et al., 2019) and fault diagnosis (Fu et al., 
2019). Machine learning algorithms and artificial intelligence are found 
to be highly useful to predict process performance (Huang et al., 2019; 
Jia et al., 2018). The real-time monitoring capabilities provide SMMEs 
with insights into possible states, operating, and failure modes that can 
occur and support the improvement of the existing manufacturing pro-
cesses (Rivera Torres et al., 2018). Learning effects can be exploited for 
preparing batches by grouping customized orders based on similarities 
in the production process, reducing the average throughput time (Cas-
tellano et al., 2019). The existing planning and scheduling methods in 
mixed-model production industries are not efficient enough to be uti-
lized in SMS. There is a need to update the plan and schedule in real-time 
(Saif et al., 2019). The simultaneous rate for the arrival of orders and the 
product delivery schedule in SMS are identified as the two significant 
complexities in scheduling (Fan et al., 2019). Efficient scheduling sys-
tems result in a reduced number of works in process and less pressure on 
the buffer. One of the important aspects of SMS is regarding when and 
how the information is used for decision making. The real-time infor-
mation on the completion of jobs may be used for rescheduling of jobs. 
However, the SMMEs should understand that the efficiency of these 
schedules will be dependent on the variability in the processing time and 
the quality of the initially generated schedules (Framinan et al., 2019). 


The diagnosis & prognosis measures also support redundancy plan-
ning and reducing the quality inspections at the manufacturing shop 
floor. Renna (2019) suggests that the cyber-physical interface, combined 
with the use of artificial intelligence and self-adapting activities, can 
enable a station of the automated flow line, reducing the time 
consuming and costly setups for the SMMEs. Quality control is a crucial 
aspect of any manufacturing organization and includes product in-
spection at different stages of manufacturing. The SMMEs with the in-
vestments in the SMS can aim to minimize the inspection cost, improve 
the outgoing quality, and reduce inspection requirements (Kang et al., 
2018). The time consuming and costly product qualification testing, 
which is performed using conventional standards and user-defined re-
quirements, can be made efficient by using predictive analytics (Stoya-
nov et al., 2019). 


The above discussions and implications provide valuable informa-
tion to the SMMEs on the crucial performance dimensions and the 
measures they need to consider for managing SMS performance. Based 
on the above discussions and implications of the study, a general 
framework on how to use the identified performance measures and 
evaluate the SMS performance is presented in the following section. 


6. Smart manufacturing performance measurement system 


The study identified ten performance dimensions, namely, cost, 
quality, flexibility, time, integration, optimized productivity, real-time 
diagnosis & prognosis, computing, social and ecological sustainability, 
that can be considered as the competitive benefits resulting from an 
investment in SMS. Based on above findings, this study proposes a Smart 
Manufacturing Performance Measurement System (SMPMS) framework. 
The framework presented in Fig. 2 is expected to guide SMMEs in 
evaluating SMS investments. 


Although the study was specific to auto-component manufacturers, 
the SMPMS framework can be used by any Industry after validating 
these performance dimensions. The study found that the benefits offered

by SMS are far more significant than the narrow focus of traditional 
manufacturing systems on dimensions of cost, quality, flexibility, and 
optimized productivity. The SMPMS framework proposes that the 
evaluation considers the impact of SMS on all the ten performance di-
mensions relative to their importance to achieving the business objec-
tives. Typically, there will be trade-offs engaged in adopting an SMS. For 
e.g., an SMMEs may consider implementing AR for employee training. 
This may improve the performance of the SMMEs in developing an 
excellent social eco-system with satisfied employees and non-invasive 
machine interaction. However, this may impact the SMMEs more by 
increased cost than is gained by the development of a social eco-system. 
Once the SMMEs selects the appropriate performance dimensions, the 
next step is to set the performance target using suitable performance 
measures from Table 4. Usually, several performance measures are 
needed to describe broader or more aggregated performance dimensions 
adequately. The performance targets are set against historical standards, 
future improvement goals or level of competition in market. The 
manufacturing goals and the performance targets guide the develop-
ment of an SMS action plan, that may involve the implementation of 
Industry 4.0 technologies such as IoT, Blockchain, additive 
manufacturing, Big data analytics, AR/VR, etc. On application, the 
performance targets are needed to be closely monitored continuously 
and any deviations from the manufacturing goals should be addressed 
with an improvement plan. 


A brief illustration of the SMPMS framework is presented below. 


6.1. Manufacturing goals 


The manufacturing goals should be aligned with the overall business 
objectives of the SMMEs and should be guided by the competitive 
benefit the SMMEs would like to achieve. The manufacturing goals 
could be one or several performance dimensions. However, the decision- 
maker should take care that the selected dimensions are not conflicting 


with each other. For e.g., Integration would be the most appropriate 
manufacturing goal for SMMEs to address the changing needs of the 
customer proactively. Accordingly, the SMMEs may also select real-time 
diagnosis & prognosis as the supporting goal to become highly 
proactive. 


6.2. Performance measures 


The relevant measures to evaluate the performance of SMMEs for 
achieving the manufacturing goals should be selected (Refer to Table 4). 
For e.g., most of the measures would be selected from the integration 
dimension; however, relevant measures from the dimensions of real- 
time diagnosis & prognosis and computing performance will also be 
chosen. Let us assume that the SMMEs decides to select the measures 
real-time design & engineering changes, real-time monitoring of sup-
pliers, real-time monitoring of customer orders, dynamic line balancing, 
and dynamic order allocation to react proactively to their customers. 


6.3. Performance targets 


The targets set for the performance measures should be measurable 
and realistic. These performance targets should be communicated to all 
the functional managers to guide their operational decisions. This will 
help the SMMEs to collect all the relevant information for performance 
evaluation without any disruption. For e.g. the SMMEs may want to 
achieve dynamic order allocations to be executed in 20 min. 


6.4. SMS action plan 


In SMPMS, the action plan revolves around the implementation of 
suitable Industry 4.0 technology to develop SMS. For e.g., the best action 
plan to achieve the performance targets on the measures of real-time 
design & engineering changes, real-time monitoring of suppliers, real-

time monitoring of customer orders, dynamic line balancing, and dy-
namic order allocation could be to implement a system involving ad-
ditive manufacturing, IoT, cloud computing and big data analytics. 


6.5. Performance evaluation and monitoring 


The performance evaluation and monitoring are done by comparing 
the actual performance with the target performance as per the schedule. 
Based on the assessment, the SMMEs may come across the following 
situations.  


� No change in the performance measures, targets, and the SMS action 
plan: This is possible when the selected measures and targets 
contribute towards the achievement of manufacturing goals without 
deviation.  
� Removal or revision of performance measures: The SMMEs may identify 


after the first stage of evaluation that few measures need to be 
replaced or removed, as they are found to be irrelevant or insignif-
icant with no contribution to the manufacturing goals.  
� Revision in performance targets: The SMMEs may realize that the set 


targets are not measurable due to the unavailability of relevant in-
formation or they are unrealistic. In such scenarios, the targets need 
to be revised. 


Following above structured approach, it is believed that the SMPMS 
will support the SMMEs in developing a robust SMS, aligned with the 
manufacturing goals and the business objectives. 


7. Limitations and future research 


SMS is different from the traditional manufacturing systems in terms 
of the way operations are performed, quality is checked, maintenance is 
performed and employees’ relationships are developed; and therefore, 
requires different measures for performance evaluation. The study had 
few limitations, which provides opportunities for future research. 


Although the study setup is based on the India-based empirical data, 
India is a unique economy being one of the largest economies in Asia, 
with a large number of SMMEs, and many diaspora Indian entrepreneurs 
scattered around Asia and the Globe, there is some potential for gener-
alizability, albeit this is not the main objective of the study. Nonetheless, 
focus on India creates significant future research opportunities for 
scholars, and we invite them to test the measures in other economies in 
and outside Asia. 


The measures used in this study are statistically validated using data 
collected from medium-sized auto-component manufacturing organi-
zations based in India. Therefore, it would be necessary to conduct 
similar studies and confirm the findings in other industries such as 
pharmaceuticals, chemicals, FMCG, etc. It would also be interesting to 
find out which performance dimensions are more powerful or more 
fundamental than others while evaluating SMS. 


The SMS is a change initiative and needs different technologies such 
as IoT, cloud computing, CPS to be implemented. Therefore, SMS 
implementations will differ from one organization to the next due to 
differences in the market being served, technological maturity, 
competitive and regulatory environment. The previous studies have 
identified barriers to implementation of SMS and provided solutions to 
overcome them (Kamble et al., 2018b). However, it is presumed that 
SMS being a huge transformation process, it is sure to be influenced by 
the organizational culture, its values, and traditions. The present study 
has not considered this aspect, requiring future studies to investigate the 
influence of organizational culture on SMS performance and provide 
insights on how to measure them for effective implementation of SMS. 


The study identified a set of sustainable dimensions, namely, social 
and ecological, that influence the SMS. However, the extent of influence 
these measures have on the SMS is dependent on the existing practices of 
the organizations. The literature reveals that lean and circular economy 
practices provide a facilitating environment for Industry 4.0 and data- 
driven supply chains, leading to sustainable organizational perfor-
mance (Kamble et al., 2019a, 2019b; Belhadi et al., 2020). Therefore, it 
would be interesting to investigate how the identified performance
