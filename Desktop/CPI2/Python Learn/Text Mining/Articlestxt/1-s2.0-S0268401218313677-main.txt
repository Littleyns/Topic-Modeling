Since changes in job characteristics in areas such as Industry 4.0 are rapid, fast tool for analysis of job adver-
tisements is needed. Current knowledge about competencies required in Industry 4.0 is scarce. The goal of this
paper is to develop a profile of Industry 4.0 job advertisements, using text mining on publicly available job
advertisements, which are often used as a channel for collecting relevant information about the required
knowledge and skills in rapid-changing industries. We searched website, which publishes job advertisements,
related to Industry 4.0, and performed text mining analysis on the data collected from those job advertisements.
Analysis of the job advertisements revealed that most of them were for full time entry; associate and mid-senior
level management positions and mainly came from the United States and Germany. Text mining analysis resulted
in two groups of job profiles. The first group of job profiles was focused solely on the knowledge related to
Industry 4.0: cyberphysical systems and the Internet of things for robotized production; and smart production
design and production control. The second group of job profiles was focused on more general knowledge areas,
which are adapted to Industry 4.0: supply change management, customer satisfaction, and enterprise software.
Topic mining was conducted on the extracted phrases generating various multidisciplinary job profiles. Higher
educational institutions, human resources professionals, as well as experts that are already employed or aspire to
be employed in Industry 4.0 organizations, would benefit from the results of our analysis.


1. Introduction


The fourth industrial revolution, also called Industry 4.0, has
brought numerous changes in organizational processes, methods of
work, and staff structure in organizations (Vogel-Heuser & Hess, 2016).
Macurova, Ludvik, and Žwakova (2017) point out that organizations
transitioning to Industry 4.0 will be at risk of having workers who are
not skilled at preparing, implementing, and using technologies asso-
ciated with Industry 4.0, since higher educational institutions lag be-
hind in developing adequate educational programmes, both formal and
informal. In the same time, Industry 4.0 could have a short-term ne-
gative impact on the decreased demand for the low-skilled workers
(Weber (2016). A future challenge will be to restructure jobs and
educational programmes (Kane, Palmer, Phillips, & Kiron, 2015) si-
multaneously. Therefore, it is crucial for manufacturing organizations,
not only to prepare for the restructuring of their production processes
(Ivanov, Dolgui, Sokolov, Werner, & Ivanova, 2016), but also to analyse
job profiles prevalent in Industry 4.0 organizations, in order to de-
termine the required employee competencies for such an organization
(Imran & Kantola, 2018; Pecina & Sladek, 2017).


Due to the relevance of Industry 4.0, it has become of the upmost
importance to develop a deep insight into the required knowledge and
skills for this rapid changing area. Nevertheless, how we should gain
up-to-date insight into the skills and competencies relevant for Industry
4.0 organizations? What is the best way, not only to gain insight but
also to monitor trends in this area? In our paper, we shed some light on
these questions using text mining approach to analyse job advertise-
ments published on a website, for the purpose of uncovering required
knowledge and skills of Industry 4.0.


Current research of the skills and knowledge needed by the Industry
4.0 is scarce. Several authors wrote about the job profiles in Industry
4.0, based on secondary sources, such as scientific papers (Hecklau,
Galeitzke, Flachs, & Kohl, 2016; Pecina & Sladek, 2017). Pinzone et al.
(2017) develop job profiles for Industry 4.0, based on the in-depth in-
terviews and focus groups with managers working in Industry 4.0 or-
ganizations in Italy. However, these researches generate their conclu-
sions mainly using the literature review analysis, but due to the fast
changes in Industry 4.0 organizations, an approach that is more dy-
namic is needed. Since changes in job characteristics in areas such as
Industry 4.0 are rapid, fast tool for analysis of job advertisements is

needed. Job advertisements are a relevant source of information about
the required skills and knowledge, which can be used in order to pro-
vide fast insight into the changes in job profiles. Two main methods for
analysing job advertisements are manual content analysis (e.g., Todd,
McKeen, & Gallupe, 1995) and automated text analysis, often referred
to as text mining (Amado, Cortez, Rita, & Moro, 2017). Text mining has
relevant advantages compared to manual content analysis, such as less
required time and human work needed for the analysis (Guo, Vargo,
Pan, Ding, & Ishwar, 2016). In addition, with this paper we contribute
to the growing body of research focusing to the utilization of social
media for extracting knowledge relevant for gaining competitive ad-
vantage in various organizations (Kapoor et al., 2018; Shiau, Dwivedi,
& Yang, 2017), as well as improving the efficiency of marketing efforts
(AlAlwan, Rana, Dwivedi, & Algharabat, 2017; Dwivedi, Kapoor, &
Chen, 2015). Text mining methods has been widely used for the pur-
pose of analysing the information stored at social media websites, such
as Facebook posts (Shiau, Dwivedi, & Lai, 2018).


Against on this background, the purpose of this paper is to clarify
the competencies required for Industry 4.0 specialists, using a text
mining analysis of job advertisement from LinkedIn, the leading web-
site that publishes job advertisements (Skeels & Grudin, 2009). We have
downloaded job advertisements published on LinkedIn, which con-
tained on of the two key-terms: Industry 4.0 or Smart Factory. Down-
loaded data was cleaned and transformed, using lemmatization algo-
rithm. The list of key words has been extracted, which were further
classified into phrases and topics. Text mining has been conducted
using the specialized text mining software WordStat Provalis ver. 8.
Results of the text mining analysis were discussed in relation to the
landscape of knowledge needed in Industry 4.0 organizations.


The rest of this paper is structured in the following manner. In the
second section, we introduce the background for the research done in
this study, by looking at concepts of Industry 4.0, research done on
future job profiles in Industry 4.0, as well as the use of text mining
techniques to study online job profiles. In the third section, the meth-
odology for data gathering is outlined. The fourth section focuses on the
results, which consist of descriptive analysis, text mining, phrase ex-
traction, and topic mining. The fifth section presents the discussion of
our results in the context of the theoretical and practical contributions.
Finally, in the concluding section, we summarize the results and look at
the limitations of the study and recommend further research.


2. Background


2.1. Industry 4.0 and the concept of smart factory


The concept of Industry 4.0 is based on the vision of future manu-
facturing, embedded in the notion of a smart factory, which could be
considered as the next step in the evolution of factories (Ivanov et al.,
2016; Lucke, Constantinescu, & Westkämper, 2008; Radziwon, Bilberg,
Bogers, & Madsen, 2014; Wang, Wan, Li, & Zhang, 2016).


A smart factory describes a factory that utilizes the cyberphysical
systems (CPS) for carrying out the production tasks, based on in-
formation gathered by sensors about the environment in which the
production is occurring, as well as gathered information about the en-
vironment. CPS can be interlinked through the Internet of things (IoT),
creating a flexible, agile and decentralized production system
(Ghobakhloo & Azar, 2018; Lucke et al., 2008; Yoon, Shin, & Suh,
2012). Through AI or machine-learning, CPS devices have the potential
of becoming self-organizing, self-learning and self-adapting, as well as
capable of cooperating with other CPS devices through a broader IoT
network (Stojmenovic, 2014; van Gerven, 2017; Wan et al., 2013). In
addition, during the production process, the massive amounts of data
are collected from smart objects and are transferred to the cloud, where
advanced analytic techniques could be used the improvement of man-
ufacturing performance (Flynn, Dance, & Schaefer, 2017; van Gerven,
2017).


Machine-learning algorithms, which enable machines to execute
various functions autonomously, have an important role in the auto-
mation in Industry 4.0 organizations (Flynn et al., 2017; van Gerven,
2017). Although the complete automation is yet a far-reaching goal,
important emerging concepts utilizing machine-learning algorithms are
already being actualized in practice, mainly in regards to interoper-
ability and mass customization (Gruber, 2013; van Gerven, 2017).


2.2. Future job profiles of industry 4.0


Because of these technological changes, Industry 4.0 brings changes
in the knowledge and skills that employees should possess in smart
factories (Jerman, Pejić Bach, & Bertoncelj, 2018; Morlock, Wienbruch,
Leineweber, Kreimeier, & Kuhlenkoetter, 2016). Lorenz, Rüßmann,
Strack, Lueth, and Bolle (2015) investigated 40 families of jobs in 23
industries and found that in the Industry 4.0 »more jobs will be gained
than lost, but workers will require significantly different skills«. It is
projected that by 2025 in Germany, as one of the leading countries in
using advanced production technologies, Industry 4.0 technologies will
decrease the number of assembly and production jobs by 610.000,
while jobs in data science and information technology will increase by
approximately 960.000 (Lorenz et al., 2015). Other authors provide the
same conclusions. Achenhagen and Zeller (2011) expect that there will
be an increase in machine operation, software maintenance, and
hardware maintenance jobs in the future. A decrease will be seen in
repetitive, routine and physically demanding jobs, while those re-
quiring a higher level of education, flexible responses, problem solving
and complexity will see an increase (Hecklau et al., 2016; Lorenz et al.,
2015).


According to Lorenz et al. (2015), the number of interdisciplinary
programs that would incorporate the optimal skill set for Industry 4.0 is
lower than required. Although an increasing number of worldwide
higher educational institutions are starting graduate or bachelor’s
programs focused on Industry 4.0, the number of these programmes is
still too low. For example, several authors mention the lack of pro-
grammes in mechatronics engineering (Barger & Gilbert, 2018; Lorenz
et al., 2015), which would incorporate the broad knowledge relevant
for the automation, as well as an interdisciplinary skill set that would
support the implementation of this knowledge, such as project man-
agement. These and similar new programs would be better able to
prepare the student for work in smart factories (Barger & Gilbert, 2018;
Kozák, Ružický, Štefanovič, & Schindler, 2018; Meek, Field, & Devasia,
2003).


The impact of Industry 4.0 on the job market is controversial. Weber
(2016) discuss that technological changes in the past often triggered the
fear of job loss. Expectations for the Industry 4.0 range from the opti-
mistic ones, which envision an increase in employment and work
conditions, to the pessimistic ones, which envision decrease of em-
ployment opportunities due to the replacement of human work with
robots. Although both scenarios seem unrealistic, Weber (2016) points
out that the previous industrial revolution had a strong impact on the
job opportunities for low-skilled workers, which is likely to repeat in
the Industry 4.0 era. Sommer (2015) expresses the same concern for
SMEs, which will not be able to adapt as fast as needed.


Currently, the research on the skills and knowledge needed for
Industry 4.0 has been scarce. Most of the research use secondary
sources or qualitative research in order to shed some light to the
competencies needed for Industry 4.0 organizations (Hecklau et al.,
2016; Marnewick & Marnewick, 2019; Pecina & Sladek, 2017).


2.3. Usage of online job advertising for job profiling


Job advertisements are used in various areas as the important
source of information about the changes in required knowledge and
skills in a particular area, such as information systems (Todd et al.,
1995), and project management (Ahsan, Ho, & Khan, 2013). Analysis of

job profiles has been conducted using the two approaches: manual
content analysis and text mining. Several years ago, the usage of text
mining in the development of job profiles was still rare. For example,
Harper (2012) point out that only 4% of the researches used text
mining, among the analysed 70 research studies in the area of library
and information systems. However, the relevance of text mining for the
analysis of job advertisements in order to develop job profiles is in-
creasing (Palshikar et al., 2019). Text mining techniques are already
being used, to gain insight into job profiles, such as big-data in mar-
keting (Amado et al., 2018), to classify online job advertisements
(Boselli, Cesarini, Mercorio, & Mezzanzanica, 2018; Karakatsanis et al.,
2016), match resources with job profiles (Gonzalez et al., 2012), as well
as to predict future performance of employees (Chamorro-Premuzic,
Winsborough, Sherman, & Hogan, 2016).


Text mining has been used in numerous studies that analyse the job
advertisements in order to extract the information useful for decision
making. For example, text mining can be used in order to detect
emerging talents in organizations, and to foster their employment or
career advancement (Chamorro-Premuzic et al., 2016), to change the
system of job classifications from the traditional to the one more ad-
justed to the market changes (Amado et al., 2018), or to make rapid
decisions based on the observed changes at the job market
(Mezzanzanica, 2017). Text mining uses algorithms, such as latent se-
mantic analysis or average linkage, in order to extract meaningful in-
formation from the vast amount of textual data. In comparison with
manual content analysis, text mining is less time consuming and less
expensive (Guo et al., 2016).


Text mining involves various steps of pre-processing that are used
for cleaning the text, using techniques such as tokenization, stop word
removal, stemming, chunking, parts of speech tagging, which removes
unnecessary words and letters from the text. After pre-processing, text
mining algorithms extract words from the cleaned text of job adver-
tisements. Extracted words are combined into phrases and topics, using
various algorithms, such as cluster analysis (Kino, Kuroki, Machida,
Furuya, & Takano, 2017), latent semantic analysis (Karakatsanis et al.,
2016; Müller, Schmiedel, Gorbacheva, & vom Brocke, 2016), support
vector machines, random forest, neural networks (Amato et al., 2015;
Boselli et al., 2018), explicit rules and latent dirichlet allocation (Amato
et al., 2015). Text mining has been used for varous purposes, such as
investigating the consumer perceptions of hotels based on the online
customer textual reveiws (Xu, Wang, Li, & Haghighi, 2017), utilization
of social media posts (Facebook and Twitter) for conducting competi-
tive analysis (He, Zha, & Li, 2013), usage of social media posts for
product planning (Jeong, Yoon, & Lee, 2017), and big data analysis in
financial sector (Pejić Bach, Krstić, Seljan, & Turulja, 2019).


Text mining research that analyses job advertisements could be
consolidated into three groups. The first group of studies uses text
mining for analysis of job advertisements in order to develop a new
classification scheme of job advertisements and compare it with the
standard classification system of occupations (e.g., Amato et al., 2015;
Karakatsanis et al., 2016). For example, Mezzanzanica (2017) used text
mining for investigating Italian job advertisements in the field of
marketing in Italy. Authors used ESCO job classification taxonomy and
machine-learning algorithm over 1.9 million of job advertisements,
with the result of observed trends and dynamics in the evolution of the
labour market, and identified several emerging potential occupations.
The second group of researchers used text mining in order to improve
the quality of job matching with the potential candidates, according to
the ‘commute time, job location, job type, hourly rates, the skill set of
candidate’ (Kino et al., 2017, p.1523). These researches take into ac-
count that suboptimal matching of candidates to job positions can se-
verely cost organizations and that for this reason, higher quality-
matching techniques, such as text mining are needed. Third group of
research used text mining algorithms in order to develop job profiles for
specific vertical areas, such as business process managment (Müller
et al., 2016), knowledge management (Chang, Wang, & Hawamdeh,


2018) and big data (de Mauro, Greco, Grimaldi, & Ritala, 2017;
Gardiner, Aasheim, Rutner, & Williams, 2018), or horizontal areas, such
as lean managment (Kregel, Ogonek, & Matthies, 2019).


3. Methodology


Our methodology consists of two major steps: data extraction and
machine-learning analysis, following the approach of Jimenez-
Marquez, Gonzalez-Carrasco, Lopez-Cuadrado, and Ruiz-Mezcua
(2019). In order to present a procedure that could be useful to other
interested researchers, experts of human resource specialists, we pro-
vide the detailed description of the used data sources, and the used
analytical approach (descriptive analysis and text mining).


3.1. Data source


Job advertisements are the most important channel for attracting
new employees. Traditionally, job advertisements have been published
in printed newspapers, while in the last two decades; they are dom-
inantly published online, either on specialised sites or on social media.


In our work, we use LinkedIn as a source for job advertisements for
several reasons. First, LinkedIn has become one of the most prominent
leaders in publishing job advertisements covering a broad range of
organizations, countries, and job types (Bradbury, 2011). Second, their
job advertisements have a semi-structured form, which is suitable for
text mining analysis (Gassler, Zangerle, & Specht, 2014). Third, Lin-
kedIn can be considered a suitable open source for sampling (Žmuk,
2017).


Selection of job advertisements has been conducted in the following
manner. In order to extract relevant advertisements, we focused on job
advertisements that contain one of the two phrases strongly related to
the new trends emerging in manufacturing: “Industry 4.0” or “Smart
factory”. The following Boolean word combination was used when
searching for the relevant work (“Industry 4.0” OR “Smart factor*”).


The data for the text mining consisted of texts found in job adver-
tisements published on LinkedIn, in a period of three months, between
the 1st of April and 1st of July 2018. In this period, the total number of
2566 job advertisements that contained the word Industry 4.0 or Smart
Factory were published on LinkedIn. However, text mining was only
conducted on 1460 job advertisements that were in English. Although
one of the possible limitations of our work is the usage of too short
observational period, we consider our approach as relevant, following
other researcher’s approach who also collected job advertisements
during a period of several months (e.g. Boselli et al., 2018), or even
collected job advertisements using a one-time research session (e.g.
Müller et al., 2016).


Job advertisements have been traditionally examined using either
content or text mining analysis, but as Guo et al. (2016) state, content
analysis requires more time and more human work, which limits the
number of advertisements that can be analysed, although more rich
information about the advertisements can be gathered by human ex-
perts. On the other hand, text mining is appropriate for the big data
sets, where unstructured automated analysis of relevant information
should be conducted in order to extract useful information. Guo et al.
(2016, p.2) implicate that ‘the criterion to evaluate whether a dataset is
“big” is a function of the amount of time required for a human to make
a decision on a given unit’, concluding that the dataset measured in
thousands of items may be considered as “big”. According to this cri-
terion, our data set could be treated as a big data set, and such a con-
clusion provides the additional argument for using text mining for
analysis of job advertisements.


LinkedIn job advertisements are semi-structured. Job advertise-
ments published by these organizations contain the following fields:
company, Job title, Location, Job function, Employment type, Company
industry, Seniority level, Job description. The structure of these fields is
presented in Table 1. The research team added the following field:

418






Language of the ad.
As is visible form the Table 1, most of these fields have the free style


text input. For the purpose of our analysis, we have used the following
fields:


• Location
• Employment type
• Seniority level
• Job description


The information about the language in which the job advertisement
was published was generated manually. In some cases, job advertise-
ments were published in more than one language. However, we only
used in our analysis the advertisements published in English.


The field Location has been recoded so that it contains only the
country in which the job is placed. This recoding has been conducted
manually.


The field Employment type is a structured field, with the following
predefined modalities: Full-time, Part-time, Contract, Temporary,
Volunteer, Internship. Only one modality can be chosen. This field has
been recoded into two categories: Full-time and Other, due to the small
number of advertisements in the categories Part-time, Contract,
Temporary, Volunteer, and Internship.


The filed Seniority level is a structured field, with the following
predefined modalities: Internship, Entry level, Associate, Mid-Senior
level, Director, and Executive. Only one modality can be chosen.
Among 1460 English job advertisements, 199 job advertisements had
an empty field, and these were coded manually by two researchers
independently into one of the predefined modalities.


The field with the richest information is a Job description, which is
unstructed and was the only field used for text mining, which will be
described in the following subchapter.


Other fields (Job function, Company industry, and Skill words) had
a large number of predefined modalities. In addition, these fields could
have multiple values (3 job functions, 3 company industries, and 10
skill words could be selected for one job advertisement). For example,
possible values for the field Company industry are Construction, Civil
Engineering, Human Resources, Space Computer Software or
Information Technology and Services, while for Job type, examples are
Management, Information Technology, Project management,
Manufacturing, and Customer Service. However, these fields were not
used in the analysis, since a number of modalities is very high, which
would result in a too large number of categories per job advertisement,
which is not suitable for the analysis, due to high sparsity of the data. In
addition, some of the modalities of Company Industry are too general,
such as Services, or highly specific, such as Space Computer Software.
The same conclusions refer to the fields of Job function and Skill words.


3.2. Data analysis


The collected data were analysed in two steps: descriptive analysis
and text mining analysis.


Descriptive analysis was conducted in order to analyse the job ad-
vertisements according to the Location, Employment type, Seniority
level, and language of the job advertisement. Additionally, we in-
vestigated the relationship between the seniority level and contract
type, as well as the country of job placement, and language of the job
advertisement. We aimed to investigate.


Electronic documents have become the primary means of storing
and retrieving written communication. Data mining is focused on ex-
tracting useful knowledge (e.g., trends, patterns) from unstructured or
semi-structured files, databases, XML files in order to create data-driven
models, such as classification, regression analysis or clustering (de
Mauro et al., 2017; Gandomi & Haider, 2015). Text mining is a parti-
cular type of data mining focused on the handling of unstructured or
semi-structured text documents. Text mining can be used to identify
research trends by identifying relevant words and relationships in order
to categorize or draw conclusions.


The text mining approach was used to determine topics most often
emerging in online job advertisements related to smart factories and
Industry 4.0. We have conducted text mining using WordStat Provalis
software ver. 8.0.


In the first step, text pre-processing has been conducted, using
lemmatization and exclusion. Lemmatization pre-processes words so
that plural words were transformed into singular words, and verbs were
transformed into present tense versions from other tenses (e.g., past
tense). Exclusion process is based on using the exclusion list. For our
purpose, we used the exclusion list of standard English words provided
with the Wordstat, which was expanded with additional words, which
occur often in job advertisements, but are not relevant for our analysis
(such as a word “to expect”), or are too general (such as a word “skill”).
These additional words were selected by the researchers themselves,
based on their knowledge of Industry 4.0 organizations.


In the second step, the most frequent words that occur in more than
10 job advertisements were extracted. Using this large process number
of words was extracted. However, analysis based on words is often not
useful, since phrases that consist of two or more words are richer in
meaning. For example, the words “big” and “data” do not have any
specific meaning in the context of smart factories, but the phrase “big
data” is highly relevant. In total, 96 words were extracted.


In the third step, the most frequent phrases that consist of a max-
imum of 5 words and occur in more than 50 job advertisements were
extracted. This approach resulted in 52 phrases that were used for the
description of the required skills and knowledge for the Industry 4.0
jobs.


In the fourth step, the topic extraction has been conducted using

cluster analysis, where the extracted phrases are put through an
average-linkage hierarchical clustering algorithm, for creating a simi-
larity matrix that sheds light on phrases (topics) that occur close to each
other.


Distances between clusters are based on the Unweighted Pair Group
Mean Averaging method, which calculates the averages of the distances
between each phrase of one Cluster to every other phrase of a different
Cluster.

Jaccard’s coefficient similarity measure was used to determine the


association between phrases that occur close together. Phrases that are
associated together are represented by a dendogram. This allowed for
increased focus on the most meaningful and strongest associations
among phrases. Branches within clusters can be rotated, as the dis-
tances are represented temporally and not linearly. This means that it is
more important to look at which clusters connect to other clusters,
instead of looking at the sequence of phrases within clusters.


4. Results


First, we present the results of the descriptive analysis. Second, we
present the most frequent phrases extracted from the job advertise-
ments related to Industry 4.0 and Smart factories. We provide cluster
analysis on these phrases in order to develop the landscape of knowl-
edge needed in Industry 4.0 organizations. Finally, we analyse ex-
tracted phrases and topics according to the seniority level of the job
vacancy.

Table 2 presents the seniority level and contract type of employment
in job advertisements related to Industry 4.0 and Smart factories. More
than 90% of all contract types were full time, for all levels of man-
agement, except for internships, which were full time in 56% of cases.
The most job openings were available for entry level (32%), associate
level (29%) or mid-senior level (27%), accounting for 88% of all the job
advertisements.


Most of the job advertisements (48%) for Industry 4.0 come from
Germany (30.48%) and the United States (17.46%) (Table 3). The
United States, Great Britain, Singapore, Ireland, and South Africa are
the only countries that had all of their advertisements in English
(Table 3). Several other countries came close to having all of their


advertisements in English, such as India (98%), Norway (96%) and
Spain (91%). The least amount of English advertisements came from
Korea (12%), Italy (17%), Russia (17%) and Germany (20%). The rest
of the countries, Netherlands, China, Switzerland, Belgium, Sweden,
Canada, France, Austria, the Czech Republic, and Poland, had between
21 and 90% of their advertisements in English.


4.2. Text mining analysis


Text mining generated numerous results related to the most fre-
quent words, phrases, and topics. However, we shall present the most
relevant results, which include the most frequent phrases and extracted
topics.


Table 4 presents the most frequent phrases reflecting knowledge in
job advertisements related to Industry 4.0 and Smart factories. The
Column Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF*IDF) of
Table 4 contains values of metrics for an estimation of the importance
of a phrase in a collection of documents. The importance is based on the
ratio between the frequency at which a phrase occurs in a document
and the total number of phrases in the document (TF), along with the
logarithm of the ratio between the total number of documents the
phrase occurs in and the total number of documents present in the
collection (*IDF). Within the context of this research, TD*IDF refers to
documents consisting of job advertisements related to Industry 4.0. The
TF-IDF metric is used to pre-process the collection of documents to
exclude phrases that cannot be considered as key phrases.


The top ten most important phrases according to their frequency,
are “supply chain”, “project management”,” machine-learning”,” big
data”,” computer science”,” internet of things”,” software develop-
ment”,” digital manufacturing”,” product development” and” business
development”.


Extracted phrases can be divided into two groups: the phrase de-
scribing general and specific knowledge. Most of the extracted phrases
are related to specific knowledge, such as “supply chain management”,
“big data”, or “lean manufacturing”. However, there are several phrases
that reflect general knowledge that is transferable across different

business areas, such as “project management”, “innovative solutions”,
and “customer satisfaction”. Some of the extracted phrases also overlap,
such as “innovative solutions” and “drive innovation”, and “supply
chain” and “supply chain management”.


4.3. Usage of phrases for weak-signal detection


Day and Shoemaker (2009) stress the need for organizations to
scope, scan, interpret, probe and act on subtle information (i.e. weak
signals) that is not easily accessible with traditional methods, which
would in turn work as an early warning system, with which the orga-
nization can respond to opportunities or threats in their business en-
vironment. One method that is recommended for this purpose is ad-
vanced analytics, which can help an organization gain insight and


explore hidden trends in the vast amount of unstructured, as well as
structured data, gathered from various sources, such as cyberspace.
Advanced analytic digital technologies, such as topic mining, have
become an indispensable resource for managers, consultants, human
resource professionals, and researchers, for gaining up-to-date in-
formation on the job market and required profession-specific skills and
knowledge.


In order to detect the phrases that could be used as weak signals, we
extracted the phrases that occur in not less than 10 cases, and not more
than 30 cases. The results here are abundant since we extracted more
than 900 phrases. Manual analysis of the phrases is conducted by the
researches, and some examples of relevant phrases that indicate weak
signals are presented here. These phrases refer to the emerging fields
such as: “connectivity in harsh environments”, “image processing”,

“robotics and advanced materials”, “production lifecycle management”,
and “ability to communicate complex ideas”. Although these phrases
occurred in a small number of advertisements, they provide examples of
skills that could be highly relevant to the competitiveness of Industry
4.0 organizations.


4.4. Topic mining


As previously stated, we used the Jaccard’s coefficient similarity
measure in order to determine the association between phrases ex-
tracted from job advertisements related to Industry 4.0 (Fig. 1). Results
present the group of phrases that occur together in job advertisements.
For example, project management and supply chain appear together in
relation to continuous improvement, lean manufacturing, and opera-
tional excellence.


Fig. 2 presents the mapping of clusters, where the size of the circle
reflects the frequency of the phrase in job advertisements, and grouping
of circles reflect the strength of the relationship between the phrases in
the clusters. As previously noted, two phrases stand out according to
their frequency: supply chain and project management.


The cluster analysis identified eight topics regarding job advertise-
ments related to Industry 4.0 and Smart factories, which are presented
in Table 6. The second column presents the job profiles that were


extracted using cluster analysis. We gave the titles to the job profiles in
relation to the phrases grouped in the cluster (presented in the third
column). The fourth column presents the distribution of job advertise-
ments grouped in a cluster according to the seniority level. It can be
noted that three job profiles have the highest ratio of mid-senior posi-
tions, four job profiles have the highest associate positions, and only
one has the highest ratio of entry-level positions.


4.5. Cluster 1 - supply chain analyst


The first cluster is described using specific knowledge phrases
(“supply chain management”, “business processes”, and “advanced
analytics”) and several general knowledge phrases (“digital tech-
nology”, “digital transformation”, and “drive innovation”) needed to
support core process of supply chain management. The following
phrases reflect the knowledge required for supply chain management
from the Industry 4.0 standpoint: “advanced analytics”, “digital trans-
formation”, “continuous improvement“, and “lean manufacturing“.


Advanced analytics, such as big data analytics, has a strong con-
nection to supply chain management. Big data analytics can help or-
ganizations decrease costs and risks present in supply chains, for ex-
ample, decreased operational costs resulting from the use of sensors and
data analytics (Arunachalam, Kumar, & Kawalek, 2018; Govindan,

Cheng, Mishra, & Shukla, 2018). There are several potential applica-
tions of big data in supply chain management, such as using data col-
lected from RFID tracking devices attached to commodities, in order to
optimize inventory policies. Within supply chain management, big data
analytics can also help improve logistics/production planning and
scheduling, as well as enhance forecasting and demand planning
(Govindan et al., 2018). Big data analytics for supply chain manage-
ment is also called supply chain analytics (SCA) (Arunachalam et al.,
2018). The main sources of big data generation in SCA are enterprise
information systems, sensors, and RFID devices coupled through IoT
(Arunachalam et al., 2018).


4.6. Cluster 2 – supply chain engineer


The second cluster combines the knowledge and skill relevant for
the “supply” chain and “project management”, which both have a re-
lationship with “lean manufacturing”, “continuous improvement” and
“operational excellence”.


Lean manufacturing helps factories to organize production and
processes in such a way as to achieve the shortest lead time and in-
crease productivity by up to 25%, while keeping costs at a minimum
and maintaining or increasing quality and customization of products
(Brettel, Friederichsen, Keller, & Rosenberg, 2014; Kolberg & Zühlke,
2015; Küpper, Heidemann, Ströhle, Spindelndreier, & Knizek, 2017). In
addition to reducing waste, continuous improvement of business pro-
cesses and employee skills plays a key role in lean manufacturing and
its corresponding potential for operational excellence. According to
several experts from academia and industry, digitalization concepts,
such as data acquisition, storage, and analytics have a slight to strong
influence on continuous improvement (Hambach, Kümmel, &
Metternich, 2017; Kolberg & Zühlke, 2015; Küpper et al., 2017).


4.7. Cluster 3 - cyberphysical systems (CPS) and the internet of things (IoT)
for a robotized production engineer


The third cluster is described using specific knowledge phrases
supporting the notion of Industry 4.0: “advanced manufacturing “, “big
data“, “artificial intelligence“, “cloud computing“, “internet of things“,
“data analytics“, “machine-learning“, “computer science“, “electrical
engineering“, “industrial engineering“, “smart manufacturing“, “soft-
ware engineering“, and “data science“. Since these skills are central to
the notion of Industry 4.0, the concepts related to this job profile will be
described in details.


In regards to CPS and IoT, which are the backbone of Industry 4.0,
job candidates for this job profile are be expected to have academic and
work experience in electrical engineering, software engineering and/or
industrial engineering. Skills from these three engineering areas are
combined in the new area called mechatronics engineering (Barger &
Gilbert, 2018; Benešová & Tupa, 2017; Fernández-Miranda, Marcos,
Peraltam, & Aguayo, 2017; Kozák et al., 2018; Leminen, Rajahonka, &
Westerlund, 2017; Meek et al., 2003; Sackley & Bester, 2016;).


IoT software knowledge is necessary for supporting numerous
Industry 4.0 jobs. According to Taivalsaari and Mikkonen (2018), most
IoT developers use open source code. Several open source technologies
for cloud development are used in the following areas: security (HAP-
roxy, NGINX), data acquisition (Apache Kafka), data analytics (Apache
Storm/Spark, Apachi Hadoop), and monitoring (Graphite, Ichinga).
Since current manufacturing networks do not have a far range across
the factory, gateways are needed to pass the information to the cloud.
However, recent advances in cellular radio technologies, such as NB-
IoT, show potential for eliminating or decreasing the need for gateways
(Taivalsaari & Mikkonen, 2018).


Low-end IoT devices within the context of cyber physical systems
are actuators and sensors, for example, air quality sensors, thermostats,
and automated door locks, used in various fields (e.g., Elhoseny et al.,
2018). Low-end CPS devices are typically programmed with the pro-
gramming languages C or C++, however other languages, such as
assembly can also be used (Barr & Massa, 2006; Soulier, Li, & Williams,
2015; Taivalsaari & Mikkonen, 2018). Some low-end devices might
have a real-time operating system (RTOS) sensors. In contrast with low-
end devices, higher-end devices can have support for application de-
velopment, dynamic programming, and full operating systems, for ex-
ample, a Linux-based operating system. Such high-end devices are ty-
pically used to do advanced analytics by interacting with the cloud,
with the help of web & mobile applications, as well as administrative
and monitoring tools for CPS devices. They can be programmed with
several programming languages, such as Python or JavaScript.


Big data analytics looks for patterns, trends and associations in big
data sets, which in some cases can comprise of more than a petabyte of
data (Govindan et al., 2018; Lorenz et al., 2015). In the Industry 4.0
organizations, such experts are required to understand and use ad-
vanced computational algorithms, such as machine-learning on data
sets generated by the machines, e.g., IoT generated datasets.

4.8. Cluster 4 – digital manufacturing engineer


The fourth cluster contains the following specific knowledge phrases
supporting the notion of Industry 4.0: “digital manufacturing“, “per-
sonalized products“, “industrial automation“, “operating systems“, and
“real time“. This job profile needs to have the skills that support the
organization of various digital manufacturing processes, such as mass
customization.


The notion of personalized products is the prerequisite of mass
customization. To cater the clients with mass customization, production
control has to meet certain scheduling and machine operation needs. In
these operations, the material flow needs to be monitored and analysed,
particularly to increase synchronization of material flow and to conduct
predictive maintenance (Foidl, Felderer, & Felderer, 2016; Sanders,
Elangeswaran, & Wulfsberg, 2016; Zawadzki & Żywicki, 2016).


4.9. Cluster 5 – smart product designer


The fifth cluster contains the following specific knowledge phrases
supporting the notion of Industry 4.0: “control systems“, “product
management“, and “design and development“.


Smart product design can be delivered through various channels.
For example, customers can use web applications in order to provide
their desired product configurations. These configurations are then sent
to Computer Aided Design software for 3D modelling and product
lifecycle management, which makes all information about the product
design available throughout the whole value chain (Schuh, Potente,
Wesch-Potente, Weber, & Prote, 2014). These product designs can be
prototyped and tested among various alternative solutions, through
virtual reality or other forms of simulation, which is called the object
oriented prototyping, with objects as a virtual model of specific pro-
ducts. Virtual reality can simulate operations, services, assembly and
disassembly, workplace and product configurations, as well as visualize
products for sales and marketing purposes (Flynn et al., 2017; Zawadzki
& Żywicki, 2016). These above-mentioned approaches are referred to as
mass customization, which has the goal to produce products customized
according to customer preferences and simultaneously minimize the
production time and the production costs.


4.10. Cluster 6 – ICT specialist for factory automation


The sixth cluster contains the following specific knowledge phrases
supporting the notion of Industry 4.0: “data management”, “object or-
iented”, “engineering experience”, “product design”, “product devel-
opment”, “product lifecycle”, “factory automation”, “software devel-
opment”, and “life cycle”. This job profile is related to various aspects of
factory automation.


Product design and production control are significantly changed in
smart manufacturing, since the production system in smart production
collects data through CPS devices, and distributes this knowledge
through the IoT (Zawadzki & Żywicki, 2016). In addition, predictive
maintenance can determine faults and anomalies in products and
equipment and fix them on time for just-in-time delivery (Lee, Kao, &
Yang, 2014; Sanders et al., 2016). The usage of RFID tags also con-
tributes to the automation of production and personalization of pro-
ducts (Sanders et al., 2016).


4.11. Cluster 7 – customer satisfaction management


The seventh cluster contains the following general knowledge
phrases supporting the notion of Industry 4.0: “business development“,
“customer satisfaction“, and “quality management“. In the context of
Industry 4.0 the general knowledge related to “business development,
““customer satisfaction, “and “quality management “describe a job
profile that is in charge of aligning business processes with the needs of
customers, resulting in increased loyalty and drive for the organization.


Various aspects of Inustry 4.0 contribute to customer satisfaction.
On-time delivery and mass customization influence customer satisfac-
tion, as high ration of products are tailored directly to the needs of the
customer (Foidl et al., 2016; Sanders et al., 2016; Schuh et al., 2014;
Zawadzki & Żywicki, 2016). Predictive maintenance and digital supply
chain monitoring can drive business development, through its use of
real-time analytic capabilities of monitoring up-to-minute changes in
production, as well as up-to-minute changes in demand. Consequently,
this increases supply chain visibility, inventory forecasting, and de-
livery reliability, which in turns enhanced quality management (Brettel
et al., 2014; Elshendy & Fronzetti Colladon, 2017; Foidl et al., 2016;
Kache & Seuring, 2015). With this respect, the goal of this job profile is
to manage the big data analytics, CPS and mass customization in order
to drive innovation in areas of organizational processes, integrated
products, and service offerings, focused on customer satisfaction (Lee
et al., 2014). However, the insight into the full text of the job adver-
tisements for this profile indicates that the required knowledge and
skills are not related to the technical issues, but to management issues.
In line with that is that most of the jobs in this profile are for the mid-
senior (41%) and director (7%) positions.


4.12. Cluster 8 - enterprise software specialist


The eight clusters contain the following specific knowledge phrases
supporting the notion of Industry 4.0: “agile development”, “discrete
manufacturing”, “SAP digital”, “enterprise software”, and “en-
trepreneurial spirit”.


In Industry 4.0 organizations, the relevance of enterprise software is
increasing, since numerous specialised solutions are emerging. SAP
digital is enterprise software for discrete manufacturing and Industry
4.0, which support discrete manufacturing and agile development. SAP
digital suite, for example, contains SAP Leonardo, which through its
cloud based analytics capabilities, provides an application that smart
factories can use for predictive maintenance and supply chain man-
agement, for enhancing quality management and customer satisfaction.
SAP digital provides manufacturing execution systems (MES) and en-
terprise resource planning (ERP) applications (SAP, 2017b, 2017b; SAP,
2018; SYSTEMA, 2018).


4.13. Distribution of phrases and clusters according to management level


Table 5 presents the most frequent phrases reflecting knowledge in
job advertisements related with Industry 4.0 and Smart factories (+50
cases), which are to a greater or lesser degree, associated to different
management levels of employment.


The first line of the table presents the distribution of job adver-
tisements according to the management level for all the advertisements
included in the analysis, with most of the job advertisements falling
under the category of Associate (29%), Entry level (32%) and Mid-
Senior level (27%) positions. A smaller number of job positions are for
Director (5%) and Executive (2%) positions.


It can be noted that some phrases are more often related to Director
and Executive positions than others are, such as “project management”,
“digital transformation”, and “quality management”, which are general
knowledge phrases. The phrases more often related to Associate posi-
tion are in most of the cases reflecting specific knowledge, such as “big
data”, “software development”, “product development”, “digital man-
ufacturing”, “data analytics”, “artificial intelligence”; however, several
general knowledge phrases also occur for Associate position: “digital
transformation”, and “digital technologies”. The same conclusion can
be made for the Mid-Senior level positions. Phrases “entrepreneurial
spirit” and “innovative solutions” are also more often present for
Associate and Mid-Senior level positions, indicating that the candidates
should not also have specific knowledge of Industry 4.0 solutions, but
instead should be able to put that knowledge in the context of new
products and services, as well as inter-organizational innovations, such

as process innovations.
Fig. 3 presents the distribution of job advertisements according to


the management level within the cluster. It can be noted that in most of
the jobs, the prevailing management level is mid-senior level (Cluster 1,
Cluster 2, Cluster 7, and Cluster 8). In Cluster 3 and Cluster 5, the
prevailing management levels are Entry Level. In Cluster 4 and Cluster
6, the prevailing management level is Associate. Directors are the most
prevailed in Cluster 1 (7%), Cluster 2 (9%), and Cluster 7 (7%), and
Executive in Cluster 1 (5%). It is worth to note that in these clusters,
most of the general knowledge phrases are present.


5. Discussion


The objective of this work was to provide a detailed insight into the


knowledge and skills relevant for the Industry 4.0 organizations. The
first contribution of our work is in the area of Industry 4.0 relevant
knowledge and skills. The previous work is based mostly on secondary
sources and qualitative research. Pecina and Sladek (2017) used the
literature review approach in order to analyse the impact of new
technologies, such as robotics, virtual and augmented reality, automa-
tion, and 3D technologies, on engineering education. Marnewick and
Marnewick (2019) also used the literature review approach in order to
reveal the needed competencies of project managers and project team
members in Industry 4.0 organizations. Hecklau et al. (2016) used a
literature review on the challenges in Industry 4.0 organizations in
order to develop four groups of competencies: technical, methodolo-
gical, social, and personal. Only a few papers are using empirical re-
search in order to develop Industry 4.0 competencies. For example,

Pinzone et al. (2017) used literature review, in-depth interviews and
focus groups with managers from organizations operating in Industry
4.0, in order to in developing the job profiles relevant for these orga-
nizations. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to use
machine-learning alogirthms, particularly hierarchical cluster analysis,
to study job advertisements in regards to Industry 4.0 and smart man-
ufacturing. As such, our study contributes to the growing field of re-
search into Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing, by shedding light


into the most frequent phrases that occur in job advertisments, devel-
oping job profiles for Industry 4.0 organizations.


Pinzone et al. (2017) identified the five job profiles relevant for
Industry 4.0: Operations Management, Supply Chain Management,
Product-Service Innovation Management, Information technology-Op-
erational technology (IT-OT) Integration Management, and Data Sci-
ence Managment. Table 7 presents the overlapping of Pinzone et al.
(2017) approach and job profiles extracted from the job advertisements

in this study. Several differences are present. For example, our analysis
divides the area of the supply chain into two job profiles: a supply chain
analyst and supply chain engineer. In addition, these two job profiles
combine the area of supply chain management, operation management,
and data science management. This result indicates that current ap-
proach that is using literature review in order to develop job profiles for
Industry 4.0 organizations is limited since it does not take into account
multidiscliplinarity that is highly relevant for the organization of work
in such organizations.


The second contribution refers to the multidiscliplinarity of the
skills and knowledge required for the jobs in Industry 4.0 organizations.
The analysis of the phrases for the job profile Cyberphysical Systems
(CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT) for Robotized Production
Engineer indicates that professionals aiming to be employed in this area
should have skills typical for three areas (industrial engineering, elec-
trical engineering, and software engineering). Software engineers
should have skills, which are more traditional in this area, such as
managing gateways, cloud software, and databases, but also skills re-
lated to smart manufacturing, such as programming CPS devices.
Industrial engineers should have competencies that are related to tra-
ditional production, such as optimization and machine maintenance,
but from the perspective of augmented reality systems and human-
robot collaborations. These specialists should also be able to use si-
mulation modelling, which is typically a software engineer skill.
Electrical engineering use software engineering skills for the conduc-
tion of typical tasks for the smart factory, such as IoT device manage-
ment (Benešová & Tupa, 2017; Fernández-Miranda et al., 2017;
Taivalsaari & Mikkonen, 2018). This overlapping is likely to results in a
decrease in some of the traditional skills required of industrial en-
gineers, due to the automation of production, mostly in regards to
production planning, optimization of repetitive and simple tasks, tra-
ditional process control and manual parts assembly (Sackley & Bester,
2016).


Third, we extend the work of previous authors that used LinkedIn
for their research. LinkedIn is an example of a big data ecosystem,
which contains various information related to careers, such as profes-
sionals’ profiles, organization profiles, networking groups, and job ad-
vertisements (Sumbaly, Kreps, & Shah, 2013). LinkedIn has been used
in several research papers for developing new knowledge based on its
users’ profiles (e.g., Dai, Nespereira, Vilas, & Redondo, 2015; Dai, Vilas,
& Redondo, 2017a; Dai, Vilas, & Redondo, 2017b). However, in their
work, authors have been focused on user profiles, but not to job ad-
vertisements published over LinkedIn.


Fourth, we also contribute to the area of using text mining as a
weak-signal that can provide an insight into emerging knowledge and
skills. Yoon (2012) developed a text mining application that is used for
the identification of weak signals based on keyword extraction. They
used the application on the sample of Web news articles, which are


related to solar cells; since the method revealed a convincing result, it is
proposed to include it into long-term planning in order to support
business experts in the identification of new trends based on weak
signals. Although these methods are still in their early use, they show
potential as a way to support decision-making, that is fact-based and
rely less on intuition and its accompanying biases (Chamorro-Premuzic
et al., 2016). Our contribution follows their work with providing the
successful example of using text mining for detection of weak signals
from the job advertisement analysis.


5.1. Implications for practice


Our research has important managerial implications for Industry 4.0
practitioners. Job advertisements are a relevant source of information
that could be utilized by three groups of stakeholders: human resource
professionals, higher educational institutions, and experts already em-
ployed or aiming to be employed in Industry 4.0 organizations. These
stakeholders can benefit from the results of our research, but can also
engage in developing their text mining project themselves.


The presented methodology in our study is described in details and
is fairy simple, but useful, and it can be used by human resource
practitioners to do their own text mining of relevant job postings. We
propose three types of analysis: word frequency, phrase extraction, and
topic extrations. Each of these anylysis provides a different type of
useful information. The most frequent words and phrases can be used
for the detection of the most often required skills of the jobs in Industry
4.0 organizations. On the other hand, the least freqent words and
phrases can be used for the detection of emerging and rare skills, but
which could be crucial for the competitiveness of Industry 4.0 organi-
zations, i.e. those organizations which employ experts with rare skills
may be more efficient in various tasks neded for the fast reactions at the
market, such as data mining.


Practical implications of our research are primarily focused on the
job of human resource professionals, who can benefit from our detec-
tion of prevalent job profiles required for Industry 4.0 organizations:
Supply Chain Analyst, Supply Chain Engineer, Cyberphysical Systems
(CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT) for a Robotized Production
Engineer, Digital Manufacturing Engineer, Smart Product Designer, ICT
Specialist For Factory Automation, Customer Satisfaction Manager, and
Enterprise Software Specialist. Using this job profile, human resource
professionals in Industry 4.0 organizations can make more informed
employment decisions. As previously proposed, they can also use the
text mining software in order to develop a text mining project for their
specific purpose, e.g., focusing to a narrower market (e.g., Germany or
South Korea), or to a narrower type of job (Industry 4.0 jobs related to
supply chain management). For that purpose, they need to acquire text
mining skills which will become a necessity for human resource experts
in Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing, along with an understanding

of the key concepts discussed in this research.
Higher educational institutions can also benefit from this research in


the development of future programmes and courses. Our results in-
dicated that there is a significant demand for experts with multi-
disciplinary skills in the three traditional areas (industrial engineering,
electrical engineering, and software engineering). Job profile for the
Cyberphysical Systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT) for
Robotized Production Engineer combines these three fields. Therefore,
new educational programmes should be designed by higher educational
institutions, which would include such interdisciplinary knowledge and
skills. However, these educational programmes should be both formal
(e.g., Master studies), and informal (e.g., Life-long learning online
courses).


Experts already employed or aiming to be employed in Industry 4.0
organizations can use the results of this research in order to check the
level of their skills relevant for their current or targeted jobs. For ex-
ample, graduates of industrial engineering may be based on the results
of our research, pursue to gain additional skills related to software
engineering, such as machine learning or IoT programming. For that
purpose, they may participate in the life-long learning online courses,
developed by the higher educational institutions, or engage in some of
the massive open online courses (MooC) that has recently become a
relevant source of education in various fields related to software en-
gineering (Chang, 2016; Huang, Zhang, & Liu, 2017).


6. Conclusions


Industry 4.0 has already brought about a restructuring of jobs in
manufacturing. For example, like automation of the manufacturing
process increases, jobs in assembly and production will truly decrease,
as control of assembly and production is taken over by highly educated
data scientists and information technology specialists. Therefore, the
fast tool that can track the changes in relevant knowledge and skills
required in Industry 4.0 organizations is needed. Our study presents a
detailed procedure of online job advertisements analysis for the
Industry 4.0 jobs, by outlining the data structure, required manual
transformation and text mining process (pre-processing, word and
phrases extraction, and topic extraction). We have analysed more than
1400 current Industry 4.0 advertisements using the text mining ap-
proach, for extracting new job profiles. Extracted job profiles indicate
that Industry 4.0 organizations are looking not for the traditionally
educated industrial, software or electrical engineers, but for the experts
with the multidisciplinary skills, which can help factories to create and
improve low-end and high-end machine and device capabilities, using
knowledge and skills in embedded and distributed system development.
The study contributes to the existing knowledge in the Industry 4.0 by
(i) proposing a new typology of job profiles in Industry 4.0; (ii) pro-
viding a practical guidance for human resources professionals on how
to track changes in knowledge and skills needed in Industry 4.0; (3)
providing a current information for higher educational institutions on
how to update their curricula; and (4) presenting the usefulness of text
mining approach for exploratory analysis of job advertisements.


6.1. Limitations


Our research has several limitations. First, the limitation stems from
the selection of data source. The presented research has been conducted
in a limited time-frame since the historical data of the job advertise-
ments related to Industry 4.0 is not available. This limitation could be
overcome by the periodical collection of job advertisements during a
longer period, e.g., several years. In addition, we analysed the job ad-
vertisements published on one website (LinkedIn). Although LinkedIn is
one of the leading websites for advertising jobs, the selection of this
source increases the risk of bias. Instead of just using LinkedIn.com, our
study, as well as future studies, could have used other job postings
websitres, such as Monster, Dice, Indeed, glassdoor and careerbuilder


(Radovilsky, Hegde, Acharya, & Uma, 2018). In addition, we analysed
only the job advertisements published in English, which could be
overcome in the future with the usage of automatic translation tools.
Therefore, future research should include more websites that publish
job advertisements, including those published in languages other than
English.


Second limitation results from the usage of job advertisements as
the source of the data for making conclusions about the knowledge and
skills required in Industry 4.0 organizations. The text of job advertise-
ment can be biased itself. For example, the text of the job advertisement
could be written using the phrases that human resource specialists
could consider as understandable by the potential job candidates,
without consulting the domain experts in Industry 4.0. For example,
Granville (2014) points out that management and human resources
sometimes do not fully understand what data science is, or what skills
are needed for big data analysis, resulting in job advertisements that are
not specific enough or do not list relevant skills that are needed for the
data scientists in the Industry 4.0 organization. Due to this, the results
of our study could be biased in that they do not represent specific skills
and experience expected from job seekers, but instead, represent a basic
idea of what skill could be needed by organizations for their Industry
4.0 needs.


The third limitation arises from the usage of our methodological
approach. Although the text mining has many advantages over the
manual data analysis, the text mining process itself and the usage of its
algorithms can also create bias. Bias can be the result of various deci-
sions in different stages of text mining analysis. First, in our work, we
pre-processed the initial list of extracted words with lemmatization
approach, while it is also possible to use stemming. However, we have
conducted the initial analysis with both approaches, and lemmatization
approach resulted in richer information in relation to extracted phrases.
Second, we decided that the cut-off for most frequent phrases in job
advertisements would be 50, due to many phrases repeating themselves
as synonyms, however. As a result, a number of the less frequent
phrases were lost, which could have been of interest to the reader of
this paper. Nonetheless, the authors believe that the most important
frequent phrases were included in the study. Third, in our work we use
Unweighted Arithmetic Average Clustering, while other approaches
have also been proved useful for the purpose of topic extractions from
job advertising, such as Latent Semantic Analysis (e.g., Müller et al.,
2016). Fourth, results that are more comprehensive could stem from the
combination of different methodologies. For example, by using a Delphi
study with experts from various Industry 4.0 organizations and regions,
this study could benefit from the relevant expert knowledge, and at the
same time reduce bias.


6.2. Implications for research


Several opportunities for future research are opened by this study.
First, phrases typical for Industry 4.0 relevant knowledge and skills are
empirically extracted from online job advertisements, which could be
considered as an initial dictionary of such skills. However, we analysed
job advertisements only from one website during a limited period.
Therefore, our dictionary provides a snapshot of the current state in this
area. Several authors indicate that the development of data dictionaries
based on the text mining of job advertisements would be a useful tool
that would allow the tracking of changes in rapidly developing in-
dustries (Granville, 2014; Amado et al., 2018). In order to provide a
sustainable tool with minimum bias, which could be used by human
resources professionals and higher educational institutions, our ap-
proach should be repeated over several years, using more online sites
that publish job advertisements, in various languages. Such an ap-
proach would allow that trends in Industry 4.0 jobs are identified in a
timely manner.


Our approach did not allow complete automation. In our work, we
used manual coding of countries, recoding of several fields (e.g.,


M. Pejic-Bach, et al. International Journal of Information Management 50 (2020) 416–431


428






Employment type) and manual identification of languages. However,
this approach is time consuming and allows the analysis of smaller
samples of job advertisements, for which reasons such analysis are less
likely to be repeated on a regular basis. In addition, manual filtering of
the words and phrases increases the likelihood of bias in our research.
Future research should aim towards the examination of various ap-
proaches towards these challenges (e.g., automatic language recogni-
tion, building a dictionary of general phrases in job advertisements,
which are not specific for any industry).


We have identified knowledge and skills in the job advertisements
that describe soft-skills and knowledge relevant for a specific area. Our
results indicate that most of the job profiles are described using the soft-
skills or general skills phrases (such as project management), besides
the phrases typical for mechanical, software or electrical engineering.
Soft skills were also more often detected in job profiles for which the
higher seniority level of employment was indicated. This indicates the
need for the development of the dictionary of soft skills relevant for a
specific Industry 4.0 jobs. Such a dictionary could be developed by
using further analysis of a broader database of job advertisements
collected from various websites, using unsupervised text mining. The
usage of the existing catalogue of soft skills and matching them with the
descriptions in job advertisements, coupled with the qualitative re-
search (case studies or Delphi study) could add the value to such a
dictionary.


Finally, our approach could be used for detecting emerging jobs
profiles in specific branches of Industry 4.0, such as the automotive or
aviation industries.
