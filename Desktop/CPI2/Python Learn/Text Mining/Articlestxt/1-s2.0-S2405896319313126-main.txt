Abstract: This paper deals with the vehicle routing problems for urban good distribution. The mix fleet 


size problem is a variant of the vehicle routing problem called Heterogeneous Fleet Vehicle Routing 


Problem (HFVRP). The objective is to design a set of routes in order to minimize the sum of the costs. The 


purpose of this study is to develop a Tabu search (TS) heuristic to solve the HFVRP. The initial solution is 


obtained by a modified Clarke & Wright saving algorithm than treated by some fundamental and others 


new concepts of the TS algorithm. Our Tabu search algorithm uses a new procedure called Fusion in 


parallel with the split procedure in order to explore new search spaces. In addition, a number of 


neighborhood structure are combined together in a process for intensifying the local search. Besides, the 


proposed algorithm is boosted with an adaptive memory algorithm, known as probabilistic diversification 


and intensification. On several benchmark instances, the TS produces high-quality solutions, including two 


new best solutions for small sized instances. The results obtained illustrate the effectiveness of the approach 


and its applicability to routing problems.

1. INTRODUCTION 


In urban contexts, due to industrial strategies, urbanization and 


city design; local authorities, logisticians and citizens face 


many challenges related to freight transport externalities, 


accessibility, space management and delivery delays (Rao et 


al. (2015), Cattaruzza et al. (2017)). Therefore, to achieve 


socio-economic and environmental sustainability in city 


transportation, a major intervention on the last mile logistics is 


needed. Previous research has shown how routing 


optimization can lead to significant economic savings 


(estimated between 5 to 30% by Hasle and Kloster (2007)). 


Moreover, mutualization and consolidation strategies improve 


as well urban good distribution sustainability. Since they 


impact the network topology of last mile delivery by means of 


consolidation platforms (Cardenas et al. (2017)). Furthermore, 


these strategies are influenced by supply chain 4.0 that consists 


in Physical Internet (PI) and data exchange, relatively novel 


notions to developing nations, in order to improve the current 


unsustainable freight transportation (Ambra et al. (2018)). 


The present work is part of an urban logistics project that deals 


with the case of the city of Casablanca -Morocco-. According 


to a study conducted by the Moroccan Agency for Logistics 


Development (AMDL) in (2015) the city knows several 


problems related to the transport of goods and doesn’t have an 


actual Urban Consolidation Center (UCC), which directs the 


project towards a strategic level of decision. Such as, defining 


the size and the composition of the fleet to be located in a 


future UCC by solving the HFVRP where the fleet is 


considered unlimited, with a fixed and a variable cost of each 


type of vehicle. Therefore, in this study, the HFVRP is adapted 


to an urban setting that consists: (i) in considering the depot as 


an Urban Consolidation Center (UCC), which is a 


transshipment points that involves physical resources pooling 


(warehouse/ platforms, vehicles) Choi and Tcha (2017) Zhou 


et al. (2011); and (ii) in promoting the use of small vehicles. 


The Heterogenous Fleet Vehicle Routing Problem (HFVRP) is 


one of the several variants of the well-known Vehicle Routing 


Problem (VRP), which is considered as an NP-Hard 


combinatorial problem, hence difficult to solve. It can be 


defined mathematically as follows. Let the graph G= {A, E} 


where A is the vertex set containing n clients in addition to the 


depot (vertex 0), and E= {(i, j): i, j ϵ A; i ≠ j} is the set of edges

depot. Each vehicle k has a maximum capacity Dk, a fixed cost 


Fk, a unit travel cost Mk and a three-dimensional loading space 


of length Lk, width Wk and height Hk such that Sk= Lk. Wk. Hk. 


The variable cost of moving the vehicle k= (1, ..., m) from i to 


j is given by Cij
k = Mk x Rij such that Rij is the distance between 


the customer i and j. The demand of each client i= (1, ..., n) is 


expressed in terms of the total weight of his order. The 


objective of the HFVRP is to build a set of routes (one per 


vehicle) so that the cost is minimized. The cost consists of a 


fixed cost related to the use of the vehicle and a delivery cost. 


A feasible route must meet the following conditions: (1) Each 


customer should be served by exactly one vehicle and visited 


only once (Eq. 2); (2) Each vehicle route should start and end 


at the depot (Eq. 3); (3) The total weight capacity of the lots in 


each vehicle must not exceed the load capacity of the vehicle 


(Eq. 4).  


The purpose of this paper is to introduce a developed tabu 


search heuristic for the HFVRP presented earlier. Due to the 


fact that the HFVRP is NP-Hard since it’s a variant of the basic 


VRP; The adoption of a metaheuristic turns out to be necessary 


for obtaining optimal solutions in a reasonable amount of 


computation time. Here the basic tabu search is boosted with

neighborhood.  


In the following section of the remainder, literature is 


reviewed. The proposed tabu search heuristic is described in 


section 3. In Section 4, the parameter tuning is discussed and 


experimental results are explained. Final conclusions and 


discussion are found in Section 5. 


2. LITERATURE REVIEW 


The heterogeneous fleet vehicle routing problem has different 


variants in the literature, depending on whether the fleet size 


is limited or unlimited and whether the costs are considered 


fixed or variable or both Escobar et al. (2017). The HFVRP 


with unlimited fleet was introduced by Golden et al.  (1984) as 


The Fleet Size and Mix VRP (FSMVRP). On the other hand, 


Taillard (1999) proposed the HFVRP with fixed fleet size 


called Heterogeneous VRP (HVRP). Although the similarity, 


each one is applied in a specific situation: the FSMVRP help 


determining the best fleet composition and its optimal routing 


scheme. Whereas, the HVRP help optimizing the uses of 


vehicles among an existing fleet. 


Golden et al. (1984) developed two heuristics to solve the 


HFVRP based on the Clarke & Wright Saving algorithm 


(1964) and the giant tour algorithms. Besides, they proposed a 


set of benchmark data sets to validate the heuristics. In the 


same field, Gendreau et al. (1999) introduced a new tabu 


search approach, which makes use of the GENUIS algorithm, 


initially developed by Gendreau et al. (1992) for the Travel 


Salesman Problem (TSP), and the adaptive memory 


programming (AMP) technique developed by Rochat and 


Taillard (1995). Taillard (1999) presented a column generation 


method to solve initially the HVRP then was adapted to solve 


limited fleet problem. In addition, he proposed a set of 8 


instances with only variable costs. Wassan and Osman (2002) 


proposed as well an algorithm based on tabu search, which 


consists of many variants of TS such as variable 


neighborhoods and hashing functions. In (2007), Choi and Cha 


outperformed the pervious algorithms by means of a column 


generation algorithm based on a linear programming model 


and a branch and bound procedure. Moreover, Li et al. (2007) 


put forward a record-to-record travel algorithm. A combined 


approach between TS and set partitioning (SP) was developed 


by Lee et al. (2008) in addition to a new set of large instances 


for the HFVRP. 


More recently, Brandão (2009) has proposed a heuristic 


algorithm based on TS that makes use of three different 


procedures to obtain initial solutions. Besides, a Variable 


Neighborhood Search (VNS) algorithm was developed by 


Imran et al. (2009). The heuristic makes use of Dijkstra’s and 


sweep algorithms for obtaining an initial solution and several 


neighborhood structures in the local search phase. In the same 


year, Prins (2009) developed two memetic algorithms based 


on a hybridization of genetic algorithms with local search for 


all FSM variants. Furthermore, Penna et al. (2013) is the most 


recent work treating the same FSM variant discussed in this 


paper. They proposed an algorithm based on the Iterated Local 


Search (ILS) metaheuristic which uses a Variable 


Neighborhood procedure, with a random neighborhood 


ordering (RVND), in the local search aspect.  


Although all the works listed previously treats the same 


problematic, only four of them considered all FSM variants. 


The rest of papers have considered the fixed costs and the 


variable costs separately when testing the performances of 


their heuristics, whereas the other four considered both of 


them. 


3. THE PROPOSED TABU SEARCH ALGORITHM 


In this study, a developed Tabu Search (TS) algorithm is 


proposed to solve the HFVRP presented earlier. The proposed 


algorithm (Fig. 1), not only combine the ability of the TS to 


better explore the neighborhood of a local optimum with the 


basic AMP algorithm that consists in feeding the TS with a 


new solution in each iteration so that new promising regions 


are explored. But also adopts a perturbation strategy called 


Split procedure by Lee et al. (2008) in addition to a new 


proposed strategy called Fusion as a local diversification phase 


within the TS in order to diversify the search to other 


promising area. Furthermore, a robust neighborhood structure 


is proposed and enhanced with a new route refinement method. 


Towards the end of the search the best solution found is 


shacked with an improved shaking approach.

Search (ILS) metaheuristic which uses a Variable 


Neighborhood procedure, with a random neighborhood 


ordering (RVND), in the local search aspect.  


Although all the works listed previously treats the same 


problematic, only four of them considered all FSM variants. 


The rest of papers have considered the fixed costs and the 


variable costs separately when testing the performances of 


their heuristics, whereas the other four considered both of 


them. 


3. THE PROPOSED TABU SEARCH ALGORITHM 


In this study, a developed Tabu Search (TS) algorithm is 


proposed to solve the HFVRP presented earlier. The proposed 


algorithm (Fig. 1), not only combine the ability of the TS to 


better explore the neighborhood of a local optimum with the 


basic AMP algorithm that consists in feeding the TS with a 


new solution in each iteration so that new promising regions 


are explored. But also adopts a perturbation strategy called 


Split procedure by Lee et al. (2008) in addition to a new 


proposed strategy called Fusion as a local diversification phase 


within the TS in order to diversify the search to other 


promising area. Furthermore, a robust neighborhood structure 


is proposed and enhanced with a new route refinement method. 


Towards the end of the search the best solution found is 


shacked with an improved shaking approach.

An initial solution is constructed with the modified Saving 


algorithm. Subsequently, the AMP memory is updated with a 


simple TS method using a relaxed local search procedure. 


Afterwards, at each iteration, the AMP generates an initial 


solution before starting the phase of TS optimization. Besides, 


towards the end of the TS phase the best solution found is 


updated to the AMP memory. The search is repeated until the 


max iteration is reached. 


Fig. 1. Proposed Algorithm. 


3.1 The modified Clarke and Wright (CW) Saving Algorithm: 


The Saving algorithm of Clarke and Wright (1964) was chosen 


due to its simplicity to be implemented and flexibility to be 


adapted to new practical considerations. In addition, to being 


used in so many works related to routing problems and 


considered as an excellent method for constructing the initial 


solution (Zhang et al. (2015), Wei et al. (2014)…). The saving 


algorithm consists in allocating for each customer a route that 


can contain its demand. The constructive heuristic proceeds by 


merging two routes in one with a better saving cost until no 


more feasible merging exist. The saving cost is defined as the 


total cost of two old routes minus the cost of the new one. 


Besides, the new merged route needs to respect all the 


constraints; otherwise it is not considered.  


Each time a route is modified, either by adding a new customer 


or deleting an existing one, the vehicle allocation method is 


performed. The method keeps the vehicle already affected to 


the route if the capacity occupied by the orders of the current 


route is near to the capacity supported by the vehicle. 


Otherwise, the most suitable vehicle with just sufficient 


capacity to load the orders of the concerned route is assigned. 


The same procedure is adopted to a new route. 


3.2. Neighborhood Structure: 


The performance of any Tabu search algorithm is related to its 


neighborhood structure (Local search procedure), by which the 


quality of promoting regions to be visited is determined. The 


proposed neighborhood structure is composed of six inter-


routes operations axed on two basic but effective moves 


according to Brandão (2011): insertion and swap. The six 
operations are performed in every iteration so the algorithm 


doesn’t miss any promoting region to explore; in contrary, if 


they are performed separately. The details of the neighborhood 


moves are presented below:  


1)  Customer-insertion: in which a customer ck randomly 
chosen is deleted from its current route ri and inserted in 


another route rj. The destination route rj should contain 


at least one of the µ-nearest neighbors of ck. the value of 


µ will be defined later on. The µ-neighborhood 


restriction introduced by Gendreau et al. (1994) 


contributes to avoid unnecessary moves and to find 


better solutions. Therefore, the computational time will 


be reduced.    


2) Swap-operation: consists in exchanging a customer ck 
belonging to ri with its neighbor cl from a route rj. The 


swap is feasible if and only if the destination route rj 


contain at least one of the µ-nearest neighbors of ck and 


one of the routes has more than one customer. 


3) Double-insertion: A two consecutive customers from a 
random route are deleted and inserted in another route. 


The destination route should contain one of the µ-


nearest neighbors of one customer among the two 


selected 


4) Triple-insertion: in which three neighbor customers 
from the same route are selected instead of two. 


5) 2-1 swap:  consists in exchanging two consecutive 
customers belonging to the same route ri with one 


neighbor of the two customers. The 2-1 swap is 


considered only if the neighbor belongs to a different 


route than ri. 


6) 3-2 swap: Three consecutive customers are selected and 
exchanged with 2 other consecutive neighbors. The 


same swap conditions are kept. 


After each operation, the vehicle allocation method is applied 


to the new generated routes. For example, after a successful 


insertion move, a smaller vehicle is assigned to ri and a larger 


one to rj if the new order doesn’t fit in the existed vehicle.  


Another particularity of the proposed neighborhood structure 


remains in sweeping all the µ-nearest neighbors. Since the best 


movement of a customer may not be the one with it closest 


neighbor. Consequently, the concerned neighborhood 


operation performs trial moves of all the µ candidates and 


consider only the best one. 


3.3. Mathematical formulation: 


For each solution, R, an objective function, called score, is 


calculated and denoted as S(R). A solution, S, might contain 


many routes and each route is served by only one vehicle. 


However, the score of a solution is the sum of the scores of all 


the routes of a solution S. The decision variables considered in 


this formulation are explained below: 


𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑘𝑘   Equal to 1 if the road (i, j) is served by the vehicle k, 
0 otherwise. 


𝑦𝑦𝑘𝑘  Binary, 1 if the vehicle k is used, 0 otherwise.

the volume of the vehicle k. 


3.4. Route improvement procedure: 


Clarke and Wright saving algorithm, besides being used to 


generate the initial solution, is as well applied as a refinement 


procedure. Here, after performing an operation, the new 


generated routes are improved by the CW procedure. The CW 


algorithm has been modified and adapted to generate a new 


client sequence of a route if there is any. However, there are 


some cases where the route improvement procedure doesn’t 


obtain the best route organization. Therefore, towards the end 


of the search an intra-route swap procedure is applied to the 


best solution found.  


3.5. Split & fusion procedure:  


For each iteration of the TS algorithm, the split or the fusion 


procedure is applied after the local search phase in order to 


introduce a new search space. The split procedure consists in 


splitting the longest route by two sub routes. Therefore, two 


new routes are generated better in term of cost than the initial 


giant route. The procedure was considered by Lee et al. (2008) 


as a second phase of the tabu search to diversify the search and 


explore new wide space. In contrast with the split procedure, 


the fusion procedure consists in merging two routes in order to 


intensify the search by reexploring some search spaces. 


3.7. Adaptive memory programming: 


The adaptive memory programming was first introduced by 


Rochat and Taillard (1995) as a method to boost the TS to 


solve the VRP. The main idea of the AMP consists in the 


possibility of constructing a good solution from different 


components of other good solutions. As in genetic search 


where two offspring are created from two parents Goldberg 


(1989).  


In contrast with the traditional AMP, where memory 


initialization is done in advance, the memory is initialized 


through a relaxed TS during the phase 1 of the developed 


algorithm, where good solutions are stored and sorted based 


on their score. Thereafter, in each iteration of the second phase 


a new solution is created using the data in the memory and 


improved by the tabu search. The best solution found is 


updated in the memory. The details are given below: 


Step1. Memory initialization using a relaxed local 


search. Then all the route of the different solutions in 


the memory are updated and sorted in the route 


memory 


Step2. A new solution is constructed by combining 


components of the route memory. The selection of a 


route follows a probabilistic principle which promote 


the route with the higher score. The process is 


repeated till no more routes exist in the memory. As 


for the remaining customers the CW algorithm is 


applied to complete the new solution. 


Step 3. Memory update by the storage of all routes of 


the best solution found in the TS provided that they 


aren’t already in the memory pool. 


4. COMPUTATIONAL RESULTS 


In this section the adopted parameter calibration is presented 


within the computational results on benchmark instances   


4.1. Parameters tuning: 


As any heuristics, parameters affect directly the performance 


of the algorithm. Thus, finding the right value for these 


parameters is crucial. However, there is no way of determining 


the most effective value of the parameters. Hence, they were 


set according to the literature and preliminary experiments as 


described by Gendreau & Potvin (2019). Although better 


setting could exist, the proposed one here allowed good results. 


A synthesis of all the parameters used in the algorithm is 


presented below: 


• The tabu tenure value θ; 
• The µ-neighborhood restriction that contributes to 


avoid unnecessary moves and drive the search to 


explore promising region. Therefore, it helps 


reducing the computational time. The value of µ is 


changed during the search; 


• Adaptive memory size limit T; 
• Maximum number of iterations in the algorithm K; 
• Limit of the TS phase KTS; 
• Limit of the local search procedure inside the TS 


phase KLS;

The two most influential parameters of the TS algorithm are 


the tabu tenure θ and the neighbourhood size µ. The values of 


both parameters are set according to the number of customers. 


Regarding θ, a range between 5 to 10 is used so cycling are 


evited as well as forbidding good movement. Regarding 


parameter µ, a common sense will opt to fix a large value of µ 


to increase the efficiency of local search. However, a balance 


between efficiency and effectiveness is needed, since large 


values of µ may result in excessive computational time 


consumption. A range between 8 to 15 was found to provide a 


good compromise.  As for the memory limit, it was fixed at T 


= 300 according to Gendreau et al. (1999). 


4.2. Comparative results: 


The algorithm was programmed in JAVA and executed in an 


Intel Core™ i7 Processor 2.50 GHz with 8 Go of RAM 


memory running in Windows 10. The described heuristic 


considers both fixed and variable cost and was tested on twelve 


instances taken from Golden et al. (1984) and Taillard (1999). 


The numbering system of these instances is kept the same as 


these authors, to simplify the comparison. Choi and Tcha 


(2007) generated the data set for both costs by taking vehicle 


fixed costs from Golden et al. (1984) and variable costs from 


Taillard (1999), since each study consider only one type of 


costs. For each instance, the algorithm was executed 10 times 


and the computational results of the best run are presented in 


Table 1. The best solution found is compared to: Choi and 


Tcha (2007), Prins (2009), Imran et al. (2009) and Penna et al. 


(2013). The best-known solutions are marked in bold 


characters and the new best one found are underlined. Besides, 


the new solutions are detailed in Appendix A.  


According to the results presented in Table 1, the developed 


algorithm failed to equal the results of four instances but it was 


capable of finding better results for two other ones. The 


underperformance of the algorithm is remarkable when the 


number of customers is superior to 50 where the results are 


slightly worse than the best ones in the literature, but still 


optimal. As for the CPU time, although its comparison isn’t 


obvious under different machines, it is clear that the proposed 


algorithm isn’t the fastest due to memory initialization and the 


execution of all six moves in each iteration. 


5. CONCLUSION 


This paper treated a variant of the well-known NP-Hard VRP 


called the Heterogeneous Fleet Vehicle Routing Problem 


(HFVRP) for urban good distribution. The fleet was 


considered unlimited with a fixed cost and a unit variable costs 


for each vehicle. A developed Tabu Search algorithm has been 


proposed to solve the HFVRP and tested on twelve benchmark 


instances with up to 100 customers. However, the heuristic 


was outperformed when the number of customers is superior 


to 75, the results obtained illustrated the effectiveness of the 


approach and its applicability to routing problems. 


Furthermore, two new best solutions were introduced. 


As perspective, an enhancement of the proposed algorithm is 


possible to improve its efficiency to solve large sized 


instances. In addition to adding some other variants to the 


HFVRP as time windows, split deliveries, multi-depots…etc.
