Abstract 


The world is moving extremely fast towards creating a superintelligence that will go far beyond human capabilities. Proper use of this 
superintelligence in enterprises will result in developing conditions in which their potential is fully exploited. In the context of the above, research 
has been undertaken to recognize the level of knowledge maturity in the domain of IT tools based on the artificial intelligence algorithm. In other 
words, it is about recognizing whether the enterprise knows IT tools supporting management operating on the basis of the artificial intelligence 
algorithm. It was assumed that in the fourth generation industry era such tools should be implemented by Polish manufacturers operating in the 
agricultural machinery sector. To assess  the level of business knowledge of IT tools based on AI algorithms maturity the self-evaluation 
questionnaire was developed and the research was conducted among manufacturers of parts, subassemblies and ready-made agricultural machines.

1. Introduction 


Contemporary producers have to operate in a specific, turbulent environment. Permanent social, political and economic changes 
have contributed to the fact that hitherto valid and commonly used methods of mass production and management strategies adjusted 
to them are not applicable in the present times. There is a new economy with three essential attributes - it is global, it favors 
intangible resources (ideas, information, connections and knowledge) and is strongly interconnected. These three characteristics 
constitute a new kind of market and society rooted in the ubiquitous network of connections. The global trend that enabled coming of 
the next revolution was primarily the increase in the amount of available data and computing capabilities. Thanks to them, it was 
possible to manage company's resources better, plan production and manage the entire life cycle of the product. Data analytics gave 
companies the opportunity to deepen cooperation with suppliers, as well as better responding to customer needs  [1].

1. Introduction

When observing business practice, it can be noticed that the current use of information systems in management in enterprises is 
insufficient. This is for two reasons. First of all, the functionalities of the IT systems available on the market are sometimes so 
complicated that a lot of enterprises have serious difficulties adapting their processes to them and subsequent mapping of analyzes in 
a given IT tool. Secondly - in the course of a detailed analysis of manufacturing processes that require reliable and up-to-date data, it 
may also turn out that the functionality of IT systems is insufficient in a given case, which necessitates the use of additional IT tools 
or dedicated systems supporting these sub-processes that require the most detailed data. In connection with the above, it should be 
emphasized that there is a growing demand for systems that will enable not only current running of the company, but also support 
strategic decisions. 


The interest of engineers in human intelligence has resulted in the research into the functioning of the neural mechanisms of the 
human brain. Developing such research tools as: connectionism, expert systems, artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, genetic 
algorithms, hybrid systems, leads towards developing advanced artificial intelligence. The development of information technologies 
using artificial intelligence enabled effective support and partial automation of the decision making process. Data stored in typical 
transaction systems is characterized by high detail, usually reflecting fragments of a specific field of activity, while aggregated data is 
needed to plan or consider development strategies. Additionally, the problems related to different data formats, completeness and 
reliability of the data themselves, their transformation to the required form or with insufficient efficiency of creating advanced 
reports intensify the need to develop technology based on artificial intelligence methods and techniques [2]. 


In the context of the above, research has been undertaken, the main goal of which was to recognize the level of knowledge of IT 
tools based on the artificial intelligence algorithm maturity. In other words, it is about recognizing whether the enterprise knows IT 
tools supporting management, operating on the basis of the artificial intelligence algorithm. Authors believe that in the fourth 
generation industry such tools should be known and implemented by Polish manufacturers operating in the agricultural machinery 
sector. To assess the level of business knowledge maturity in the domain of IT tools based on the artificial intelligence algorithm, 
self-evaluation questionnaire was developed; the research was carried among manufacturers of parts, subassemblies and ready-made 
agricultural machines. 


The following observations were made before the research was launched: 
 IT tools supporting management and based on artificial intelligence algorithms are not clearly comprehended by entrepreneurs; 
 There are barriers that limit entrepreneurs willing to implement and develop IT tools supporting management and based on 


artificial intelligence algorithm 
 The literature offers partial approach to managerial tools based on artificial intelligence. 


The following assumption were made for the research purposes: 
A1) Key management support tools - based on the artificial intelligence algorithm –described in the literature do not have to be 
identical and consistent with the indications of the sector's experts. 
A2) Management support tools based on the artificial intelligence algorithm should be adapted to the market requirements and the 
specificity of the adopted business model. 
A3) Only entrepreneurs and managers as well as representatives of science, characterized by a high level of general and sectoral 
knowledge, are subjected to expert and survey research, which is to ensure the reliability of research 
The work is the result of analysis of literature on the subject and individual research on the scientific and practical ground. It also 


results from numerous discussions with representatives of the sector under research. It is the result of many professional meetings, 
consultations and exchange of experiences. The considerations contained in the publication are located in the social sciences, and 
more specifically in the sciences of management and quality, in the area of computerization in business management. 


2. AI algorithm – Industry 4.0 perspective 


Artificial intelligence is defined as the field of computer science, which deals with methods, techniques of symbolic inference by a 
computer and symbolic representation of knowledge used during such inference [3]. In artificial intelligence methods, the data 
processing is transferred to knowledge processing. 


The main task of research on artificial intelligence is the construction of machines and computer programs capable of realizing 
selected functions of the mind and human senses that are not subject to numerical algorithmization. 


Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be captured in short as ‘solving tasks like humans do’. The concept is more than sixty years old as 
the term was coined at Dartmouth in 1956 by McCarthy and colleagues [4]. At that time, a new science field was envisioned for AI 
as “science and engineering of making intelligent machines.” (see [5], [6]). 


Today smart technologies are changing every aspect of human lives, from the way they work, to health care, education, travel and 
transportation. Nowadays, most of the production processes are partly or entirely based on automation and robotics devices equipped 
with selected mechanisms of AI. Dedicated manufacturing processes based on CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing) aimed at the 
implementation of specialized orders (Smart Factory), are supported by control devices that have the ability to recognize the very 
complex and individual features of items. Such quality control will be based on machine learning algorithms, gaining experience and

looking for potential defects in the entire product class [7]. Another production domain in which artificial intelligence algorithms are 
already applied is solving complex optimization problems concerning material flow planning and management [8], [9]. For this 
purpose, it is necessary to identify and locate the product in real time. The current RFID system will be supported by Industrial 
Internet of things (IoT) elements using the 5G network with high operational requirements[10], [11], [12]. 


It is believed, that by 2025 the processes and enterprises will be smart and to a great extent automated. They will benefit from AI 
technology that simulates the nuances of human behavior [13]. 


Nevertheless, AI implementation outside of the tech sector is at an early, often experimental stage. Few firms have  employed it at 
scale. In McKinsey survey of 3,000 AI-aware C-level executives, across 10 countries and 14 sectors, only 20 percent said they 
currently use any AI related technology at scale or in a core part of their business [9]. 
According to Accenture AI could double annual economic growth rates by 2035 by changing the nature of work and creating a new 
relationship between people and machines, in which people are firmly in control and technology increasingly adapts to our wants and 
needs. 


Accenture has identified three channels through which AI can reverse the cycle of low profitability across industries: intelligent 
automation, labor and capital augmentation, and innovation diffusion [14]. 


What is the future of artificial intelligence in 4.0 industry? According to Deloitte, another industrial revolution will be based on 
close cooperation of people with machines equipped with cognitive capabilities. This is what the authors of the report "Exponential 
technologies in manufacturing" concluded after examining the opinion of leaders in the area of new technologies and production 
directors in the largest companies operating on the global market. According to the authors of the report, human and artificial 
intelligence will be complementary to each other – providing a unique value resulting from its strong, unique sides. Tedious, 
repetitive activities will be performed by the machines, while the employees of flesh and blood will take care of what is creative, 
requiring critical thinking, prediction and a dose of sensitivity. What is also important for the labor market is the fact that robots 
cannot do without maintenance, and so far they are completely dependent on human. The more machines, the more repairs and, 
consequently, more employees needed [15]. 
The advanced machine learning algorithms, easy-to-use interfaces and manual control systems that can be used to teach a robot to 
perform specific tasks will contribute to development of co-bots to perform new tasks and operate in a variety of work environments. 
The programming is done by memorizing sequences of movements made by man and does not require conventional coding. Such 
machines are already available on the market, they are able to move so as not to pose a threat to people, and for safety reasons they 
are equipped with special protectors. For the same reason, the strength with which they perform tasks has been severely limited. They 
will probably become more and more common solution in the future [15]. 


3. Material and method 


The goal of the research was to recognize the level of knowledge on IT tools based on AI algorithm maturity. Research, which 
was referred to the era of the fourth generation industry, was conducted from the perspective of manufacturing companies operating 
in the agricultural machinery sector. The research scheme is depicted in Figure 1.

The fourth industrial revolution is a concept regarding the use of automation and data processing and exchange [1], as well as the 
implementation of various new technologies allowing the development of the so-called cyber-physical systems and introducing 
innovation to production methods [16], [17], [18]. In order to comprehensively address the subject matter, the literature on the 
subject of new technologies was recognized, including the Internet of Things [19], [20], cloud computing [21], [22], [23], [24], Big

Data analysis [25], artificial intelligence as well as incremental printing, augmented reality [26] or co-bots [27]. 
The analysis of the literature was used to define the catalogue of tools, potentially representing IT tools based on AI algorithm, 


that was subject of verification by the group of selected experts. 
It has been assumed that the most important criterion for experts selection will be practical application of knowledge. In the 


context of the above, the experts were practitioners of management (29 people). However, representatives of academia (3 people) 
were also invited to express their views. 


Exploration of the literature and discussion among experts was aimed at compiling a research tool in the form of an assessment 
sheet.  


Participants of the study individually identified tools that in their opinion should be used in the assessment of the maturity of 
knowledge on IT tools based on the artificial intelligence algorithm. Having phenomenological character (based on experience) - 
expert research allowed to recognize opinions, feelings and associations, which were caused in the analyzed case by a number of 
factors referring to the problem of IT tools based on the artificial intelligence algorithm. 


Based on expert opinion, guidelines for quantitative research have been established. As a result of the research, the accuracy of 
language selection was verified; it was important to verify what are the terms used by practitioners. These studies, to a great extent, 
have facilitated the researchers' closeness to the natural world of the respondents, understanding their attitudes and language, which 
greatly helped to carry out quantitative research properly while ensuring full understanding of the phenomena investigated among 
potential respondents.  


The basic survey (self-assessment) was conducted on a sample of 71 enterprises representing the agricultural machinery sector.  
The respondents were the owners (45.07%) and managers (54.93%) representing: micro - 9 people (12.68%), small - 25 people 


(35.21%), medium - 31 people (43.66%) ) and large - 6 people (8.45%) production companies operating in the agricultural machinery 
sector. 7.04% of population surveyed were people under 30 years old, 33.80% were between 31-40 years old, 26.76% between 41-50 
years old, 23.94% between 51-60 years old and 8.45% over 60 years old. Considering only the group of owners (32 people), more 
than 40.63% were over 50, the age of 34.38% was in the range of 41-50 years, while 25% of the owners were under 40 years of age. 
In the case of managers, as many as 25.64% of the respondents were over 50, the age of 20.51% was in the range of 41-50 years, 
while 53.85% was under 40 years of age. Among the respondents, the majority were secondary and university graduates (62 people), 
43.75% of the owners were university graduates, 31.25% -high school/secondary school graduates, and 25% - vocational school 
graduates. In the case of managers, 69.23% of respondents were university graduates, 28.21% high school/secondary school 
graduates, and 2.56% vocational school graduates.  


To conduct the research, the five levels scale of maturity was implemented, with the levels of maturity characterized by 
knowledge and experience with AI tools (table1).

The respondents were asked to assess their knowledge maturity with respect to the identified AI tools, applications and systems 
with the maturity scale presented in the table 1. The results of the research are presented in the next chapter. The authors are aware of 
the fact that on ordinal scales, the average value of a given feature should not be taken into account. Nevertheless, in the research 
methodology, it is used in the questionnaires and thanks to it one can get an answer regarding the degree of acceptance of a given 
phenomenon or view. Therefore, it is appropriate and can be used in this research. 


The next stage of the conducted research is a description of the results obtained and their interpretation.

In the era of shortage of executive staff, the ability to transfer the entire function of managing the manufacturing process to 


specialized devices, most often to computers, gains special importance, while partially leaving some scope of executive functions to 
people. Following the indicated trend, the surveyed enterprises show a relatively high level of maturity in the knowledge of modern 
technologies and automatic devices (CNC numerically controlled machines, welding robots, conveyors, feeders) operating on the 
principle of self-regulation and working without human participation or with its limited participation (average rating 4.35, 52.1% 
indications of 5th level of maturity). Proper tools save costs, make people's work easier, minimize the risk of errors, give new 
opportunities, optimize and automate customer service processes. The effect of implementing the right tools to support 
communication with the customer is the increase in sales, which contributes to an increase in revenues and profitability of the 
company. That is why knowledge is so important. Enterprises are aware of the fact that new conditions require them to prepare and 
implement strategies for multi-channel communication with the client and the use of modern marketing automation and call / connect 
center tools; they indicate high level of knowledge maturity in this area (average rating 4.30, 46.5% indications of 5th level of 
maturity). The new conditions are the challenge for the sales departments, but at the same time an excellent opportunity for fully 
personalized customer service. Attention is drawn to the need to implement IT tools that enable integrated product design; enterprises 
demonstrate knowledge, awareness and extensive experience in this area (average rating 4.20, 36.6% indications of 5th level of 
maturity). 


Customer service is the ability to meet the requirements and expectations of customers mainly regarding the time and place of 
ordered deliveries, using all available forms of logistic activity, including storage. Errors in warehousing logistics often result in the 
loss of customers for competition. In order to avoid them, it is necessary to implement tools supporting warehouse service in terms of 
four main dimensions: time, reliability, communication and convenience. IT systems supporting the work of a warehouse in Poland 
are used in almost every enterprise, and their importance is constantly growing due to the economic growth, also associated with 
increased trade in goods. There are completely new challenges and needs. The answer to such needs are systems operating on the 
basis of the artificial intelligence algorithm. However, the availability of the systems, their effectiveness, and above all the 
knowledge about their implementation is very diverse, in the case of the surveyed enterprises relatively mature (average rating 4.18, 
31.0% indications of 5th level of maturity). 


Among the companies seeking contact with clients, the interest in the social media increases. While there is no doubt that skillful 
activities conducted on the basis of social media support sales, what is the knowledge level in this area? The widespread presence of 
social media in the practice of the surveyed enterprises is a manifestation of relatively well-established knowledge in the applications 
that give the opportunity to interact with the participants, thus becoming a space for community development (average rating 4.13, 
39.4% indications of 5th level of maturity). Nevertheless, the challenges faced by social media researchers, such as the combination 
of the quantitative and qualitative aspect, or the problem of complexity and the selection of indicators, prove the need to constantly 
expand knowledge in this area. 


Building a customer relationship requires the use of a system that will also provide the user (manufacturer) with the necessary 
feedback on the basis of which he will be able to make strategic decisions. E-commerce has created an effective platform for 
producers to obtain information, which forced them to constantly gain knowledge on the possibilities of using tools that support

electronic customer service, including exchanges, refunds and complaints (average rating 4.07; 33.8% indications of 5th level of 
maturity). 


Until recently, purchasing systems were the domain of a small group of professional buyers. Meanwhile, electronic offer inquiries 
and purchase auctions improving work, increasing the transparency of purchases and enabling measurable savings, often significantly 
exceeding the expectations of users have become commonplace. The trend of digitization of purchasing processes is unstoppable, of 
which entrepreneurs are aware of the significant knowledge in the field of the possibility of using tools supporting procurement 
processes (average rating 4.07, 35.2% of indications of 5th level of maturity). 


Striving for optimal stock levels is a constant search for a compromise between two opposing needs. On the one hand, enterprises 
want to maintain constant and free access to the raw materials they need, on the other hand, they try to minimize the costs associated 
with their possession and storage. In effective warehouse management, the key element is the ability to instantly collect, control and 
present reliable information about them. Implementing the functionality of dynamic management of stock updates requires the 
implementation of warehouse management systems, of which entrepreneurs know more and more (average rating: 4.06, 31.0% of 
indications of 5th level of maturity). In the era of industry 4.0, inventory management is of particular importance. Attention is given 
to ensure maximum availability at a minimum cost. This forces the necessity to implement modules for centralization and automation 
of inventory management. That is why the algorithm, which adapts selectively the optimal stock level of individual materials in order 
to minimize lost sales cost is being used more and more often. Attention is drawn to the relatively high level of knowledge and 
awareness regarding the possibility of using an application that will automate both generation of orders to suppliers and internal 
orders (average rating of 4.03, 33.8% of indications of 5th level of maturity). Therefore, it is crucial to implement a dynamic track 
management module in production with the customer's order (flexible client panel, statuses, notifications, feedback tools, etc.), which 
in turn is conditioned with "mature" knowledge on the basis of which the manufacturer will be able to take strategic decisions on its 
implementation (average rating 4.01, 31.0% indications of 5th level of maturity). 


A common way to support production control is the use of hierarchical information systems built on the basis of various decision 
support tools, integrated with common databases. In enterprises, there is currently growing interest in computational algorithms 
enabling production planning taking into account the availability of tools required to carry out the production process at a given time. 
Manufacturers face a complex decision problem consisting in answering the question of how much and when to produce in order to 
minimize the cost of setup. The entrepreneurs seem to have specific knowledge, required when using production planning tools 
implemented in contemporary integrated management systems (average rating 4.00, 29.6% indications of 5th level of maturity). 


In order to guarantee availability of information throughout the enterprise, the database should be synchronized with partial 
resources in other systems. Therefore, knowledge of comprehensive and open to integration sales platforms (orders, statistics panels, 
analytics panels, control panels) that enable integration with the production department is important (average rating 3.97, 26.8% 
indications of 5th level of maturity). The need for analytical and forecasting information, which can be the basis for assessing the 
state of the enterprise, in all aspects of its operations, is undeniable regardless of the size or nature of the production enterprise. 
Enterprises aware of their controlling needs should make the decision about computerization. Attention is drawn to the need to 
broaden knowledge on integrated tools supporting analyzes in the field of production controlling (average rating 3.96, 26.8% 
indications of 5th level of maturity). 


It is important from the marketing 4.0 point of view to achieve the effect of priority, diversification, uniqueness or exclusivity on 
the market. Therefore, attention is paid to the knowledge of applications that enable the management of material and raw materials 
turnover in relation to the commercial offer and goods flows (average rating 3.96, 29.6% indications of 5th level of maturity), 
including software supporting internal logistics management.  


The problem of managing a huge amount of product information and the possibility of their transparent presentation is a 
significant challenge in the context of the industry4.0. It is crucial to make product information important for the customer efficiently 
- preferably in the form of a positively distinguished competition. Significant savings potential and streamlining of purchasing, 
production and sales processes opens up a wider recognition and implementation of the software platform for managing product and 
catalog information to enterprises. Although IT systems in this area are known and widely used, there is a possibility to improve 
knowledge in terms of their functioning and implementation. (average rating 3.86, 21.1% indications of 5th level of maturity).  


In the Industry 4.0, planning of actions and the response to irregularities is very important in order to ensure maximum 
availability at a minimum cost. Attention is drawn to the necessity of a wider recognition of tools supporting the elimination of errors 
and guaranteeing a continuous increase in quality and a system of automatic handling of product defects at the level of inventory 
management. This will allow elimination of mistakes, errors, poor product quality, incorrect markings, etc.  


From the Industry 4.0 point of view, multi-directional communication and information flow, including correlation of data from 
correspondence with data from systems is important. Therefore, it is reasonable to implement a module that gives the opportunity of 
electronic exchange of documents between counterparties according to EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) standard. In the face of 
fourth generation industry attention is paid to the need to gradually implement applications that provide the ability to integrate with 
forwarding computer systems in generating printouts according to specific templates, generation of individual shipment labels for 
each of the shippers, or automatic settlement of collection amounts. Attention is drawn to the need to implement applications that

enable management of production equipment [1]. A tool, application or IT system based on the artificial intelligence algorithm is 
well known and used in the indicated areas; nevertheless, there are opportunities to improve knowledge about the possibility of their 
use and use, which is a key message of the philosophy of continuous improvement.  


5. Conclusion 


Contemporary ideas, concepts and theories stress the role of knowledge in effective enterprise management. Numerous research 
on the interdependence between the level of knowledge maturity and enterprise development contribute to the development of 
theoretical and empirical achievements, while generating consistent results regarding the direction and strength of this relationship. 
Hence, the development of an appropriate method for assessing the maturity of domain knowledge and, on this basis, its assessment, 
should be the subject of research; confirms the desirability of their implementation. The development of technology leads to the 
situation in which knowledge about tools, applications or information systems  based on the artificial intelligence algorithm  becomes 
an indispensable attribute of all activities and intentions; knowledge possession determines the conduct and effectiveness of 
undertaken activities. 


In order to implement and maintain modern systems using the artificial intelligence algorithm, on which the idea of Industry 4.0 
is based, not only knowledge in the field of management, but also automation or IT is needed. As these fields become more and more 
intertwined, it will be necessary to train interdisciplinary specialists - management engineers. 


An important barrier related to the implementation of solutions specific to Industry 4.0 will not only be the acquisition of the right 
technology, but - related to this - the need to acquire new knowledge. Therefore, the authors undertook research which main goal was 
to recognize the level of knowledge maturity in the domain of IT tools based on the artificial intelligence algorithm. In other words, it 
was about finding out whether IT tools based on AI supporting management are recognized and implemented. 


The conducted assessment was an excellent opportunity to verify the views held in the context of participant observation. The 
results of the research confirmed the authors’ belief that knowledge in the domain of IT tools based on the artificial intelligence 
algorithm, however high, in some areas still needs to be improved. The observations and interviews conducted by the authors 
predispose them to stating that in the majority of surveyed entrepreneurs, in their activity, they perceive the necessity to implement 
modern IT solutions supporting management; they see the threat of not knowing about the available applications, tools or systems. 


The authors are aware of the fact that the presented areas of evaluation do not fully cover the discussed issues, but it is important 
that they become any indication and basis for those who want to assess the level of knowledge maturity in their company. The 
authors hope that the development will affect the development of management and quality sciences.
