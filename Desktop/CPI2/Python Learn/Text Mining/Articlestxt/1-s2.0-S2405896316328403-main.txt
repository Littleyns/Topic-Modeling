1. INTRODUCTION 


Industry 4.0 has been highlighted as one of the key issues of 


global industry, and a concept of smart factory is emerging as 


a means of achieving Industry4.0 by incorporating recent 


Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in 


manufacturing system, especially Internet-of-Things(IoT). 


Factory-of-things using wireless technology and Service 


Oriented Architecture(SOA)based automation is suggested as 


one of smart factory model(Zuehlke 2010), and Cyber-


Physical System is being highlighted as means of achieving 


industry 4.0 (Lee et al. 2015). There are many definitions and 


description of the smart factory, but most have the following 


aspects in common: 1) Components in smart factories are 


networked and it is possible to collect useful data from them; 


2) The current status of manufacturing components can be 


determined and visualized in real time; 3) Autonomous and 


automatic processes can be executed based on optimized 


manufacturing plans; and 4) Advanced manufacturing 


services can be provided on shopfloor and to external 


systems.  


Cyber Physical Manufacturing System (CPMS
PS


), developed 


by POSTECH Center for Ubiquitous Manufacturing, 


provides well-organized architecture to realize smart factory 


for Industry 4.0 into in an optimized and systematic fashion 


(Fig. 1). CPMS is composed of four components: 1) smart 


shop floor, 2) smart manufacturing execution system (MES), 


3) smart factory service, and adoption engineering. Smart 


shop floor is a key driver for making the manufacturing 


system smart based on IoT and factory things. Smart MES is 


capable of carrying out legacy functions as well as smart 


functions. Smart factory service provides advanced factory 


applications as service item through enterprise network. 


Smart factory adoption engineering provides methodology 


about how to adapt and develop the smart factory in a 


systematic way. 


In terms of information, the essence of a smart factory is how 


data are acquired, analyzed, and applied for the various 


internal and external stakeholders. To access the full potential 


of the IoT for efficient data and information flow, a 


specialized information service bus is needed for 


manufacturing in a smart factory, as described in Fig. 1 as 


Enterprise network for office floor, and Real-time Network

 and industry 4.0. 


Previous research on data and information technology has 


been concerned with information content such as the design 


and exchange of product, process, resource (Lee and Jeong 


2006; Suh et al. 2008; Wang and Xu 2012), manufacturing 


(Lee et al. 2012; Yoon et al. 2012), monitoring (Bogdanski et 


al. 2012), and maintenance (Espindola et al. 2013). As far as 


information services are concerned, the ubiquitous product 


lifecycle support (UPLS) system has been proposed (Lee and 


Suh 2009). UPLS is an information middleware that supports 


product related activities in the product lifecycle with product 


data models. However, since UPLS deals with product-


oriented data, it is not suitable to be adapted as a smart 


factory information middleware. Smart factories aim to 


improve the overall manufacturing performance, so the data 


target should cover machine, factory and enterprise levels. 


As far as information content is concerned, previous research 


has mostly used productivity as the key performance 


indicator (KPI). However, the manufacturing information and 


architecture should be designed to cover various KPIs 


comprehensively. In this research, productivity, environment, 


and social impact are used as the components of the total 


performance index (TPI) of a generic smart factory, rather 


than focusing on specific KPIs. 


Based on the state-of-the-art outlined, this paper proposes a 


reference architecture for an information bus or middleware 


as a means of network system for CPMS. The middleware 


can be used for information acquisition, analysis, and 


application by the various stakeholders at machine, factory, 


and ERP levels. This paper suggests characteristics and 


architecture of the information service bus, and 


implementation procedure. 


2. ARCHITECTURE OF INFORMATION BUS 


In this section, a conceptual model of MIB will be developed 


that reflects its role and significance in delivering smart-


factory services. 


2.1  Vision of Information Bus 


A smart factory is expected to provide various services for 


improved manufacturing performance based on 


manufacturing information. However, it is not easy to find 


the desired service among numerous sources because the 


services are scattered all over the manufacturing system. 


MIB acts as an intelligent information middleware that helps 


users to find the desired information and deliver the 


corresponding service by collecting, linking and summarizing 


distributed services as shown in Fig. 2. MIB provides 


services in a well-structured form, and users can request 


services and get results easily and quickly.  


2.2  Characteristics of Information Bus 


In order to realize the vision of MIB, four major functions are 


required: 1) Connect to the manufacturing services; 2) 


Itemize the services in a well-defined structure; 3) Describe 


the detail of each service; and 4) Manage service requests and 


their subsequent provision. In this section, the characteristics 


of MIB for implementing each function will be introduced. 


First characteristic is conceptual aspects. If user-specific 


smart-factory services are provided by the middleware, rather 


than by separate and specific service providers, then the user 


feels as though the middleware is providing all the services. 


This is a simple description of the conceptual aspects of MIB.

target should cover machine, factory and enterprise levels. 


As far as information content is concerned, previous research 


has mostly used productivity as the key performance 


indicator (KPI). However, the manufacturing information and 


architecture should be designed to cover various KPIs 


comprehensively. In this research, productivity, environment, 


and social impact are used as the components of the total 


performance index (TPI) of a generic smart factory, rather 


than focusing on specific KPIs. 


Based on the state-of-the-art outlined, this paper proposes a 


reference architecture for an information bus or middleware 


as a means of network system for CPMS. The middleware 


can be used for information acquisition, analysis, and 


application by the various stakeholders at machine, factory, 


and ERP levels. This paper suggests characteristics and 


architecture of the information service bus, and 


implementation procedure. 


2. ARCHITECTURE OF INFORMATION BUS 


In this section, a conceptual model of MIB will be developed 


that reflects its role and significance in delivering smart-


factory services. 


2.1  Vision of Information Bus 


A smart factory is expected to provide various services for 


improved manufacturing performance based on 


manufacturing information. However, it is not easy to find 


the desired service among numerous sources because the 


services are scattered all over the manufacturing system. 


MIB acts as an intelligent information middleware that helps 


users to find the desired information and deliver the 


corresponding service by collecting, linking and summarizing 


distributed services as shown in Fig. 2. MIB provides 


services in a well-structured form, and users can request 


services and get results easily and quickly.  


2.2  Characteristics of Information Bus 


In order to realize the vision of MIB, four major functions are 


required: 1) Connect to the manufacturing services; 2) 


Itemize the services in a well-defined structure; 3) Describe 


the detail of each service; and 4) Manage service requests and 


their subsequent provision. In this section, the characteristics 


of MIB for implementing each function will be introduced. 


First characteristic is conceptual aspects. If user-specific 


smart-factory services are provided by the middleware, rather 


than by separate and specific service providers, then the user 


feels as though the middleware is providing all the services. 


This is a simple description of the conceptual aspects of MIB.

MIB is linked to each manufacturing system and delivers the 


results of services to users. MIB plays the role of a trigger for 


performing actual smart factory services, and it visualizes 


services in a well-defined structure. 


MIB service description language is the second characteristic. 


Before requesting manufacturing services, a user needs to 


know exactly which services can be provided. To deliver 


such details, the middleware should have a standard for 


describing services. For this, a service description language is 


defined for MIB. Using the language, the service can 


represent which functions will be executed, what information 


will be delivered, what input and output will be. 


The last one is service request process application. Various 


systems and users are connected through MIB. There are 


many issues in service provision, such as convenience, 


reusability, security, and different data models between 


systems. For this, the MIB process application modules for 


service requests are developed. There are six main modules 


of the unified product lifecycle data model: (i) unified 


product lifecycle data model (ii) process execution 


management, (iii) user authentication and data accessibility, 


(iv) user-defined process support, (v) service search support, 


and (vi) service history management. 


2.3  Reference Architecture of Information Bus 


The characteristics of MIB relate its functionalities as 


information middleware. However, the middleware aspect is 


not enough to satisfy the requirements of a smart factory. As 


stated earlier, a smart factory aims to enhance TPI through 


manufacturing services, so the middleware should reflect TPI 


perspectives. In this section, a reference architecture of MIB 


is proposed, with lists of services according to the service 


level.  


The services and reference architecture for MIB are 


developed (Fig. 3). Each service is categorized as Smart 


Machine Controller (SMC), Smart Manufacturing Optimizer 


(SMO), Smart Manufacturing Execution System (SMES), or 


Smart Enterprise Contents Management (SECM) according 


to its characteristics. Process application modules are applied 


for the sound use of each service.  


SMC is composed of services for controlling and managing 


manufacturing machines. Intelligent resource control and 


monitoring services are defined, and it is possible to evaluate 


manufacturing processes at the machine level. 


SMO is composed of services for optimizing manufacturing 


processes. It provides machine-level process planning and 


services for sustainable TPI improvement.  


SMES is composed of services for manufacturing execution. 


It provides services for manufacturing-process planning and 


execution, monitoring, measuring, and maintenance. In order 


to provide SMES services, three smart agents are designed as 


a sub-module of SMES. 


The product agent provides services for supporting the 


manufacturing progress of a product. Through the product 


agent, the location and information of product are managed in 


real time. The resource agent provides services for 


monitoring the condition of a resource. Through the resource 


agent, it is possible to provide sensor data, to identify the 


machine, and to react quickly to unforeseen events. People 


are sources of data for some services and consumers of other 


services. Thus, the human agent contains two types of 


services: customer and provider. As a customer, the human 


agent provides support for smart-device usage, augmented 


reality support, knowledge for manufacturing and 


maintenance operations, and other context-based information. 


As a data provider, it mainly reports the person’s current state.

SECM provides services for managing the information of a 


manufacturing system. Through SECM services, it is possible 


to manage manufacturing process history, knowledge for 


operation and control, real-time manufacturing information, 


criteria for process evaluation, and maintenance information 


and knowledge. The delivery date can be controlled in 


conjunction with a process plan and performance can be 


evaluated on the entire manufacturing-system level. SECM 


generates reports for the operational results. 


3. IMPLEMENTATION PROCEDURE 


The MIB reference architecture presents the smart-factory 


services needed to improve productivity, environment, and 


social impact. However, not every manufacturing company 


needs to introduce all services at once when implementing a 


smart factory. Rather, they need services for each specific 


performance that requires improvement. In this section, an 


implementation procedure for extracting such services is 


proposed based on the MIB reference architecture. 


The methodology supports the identification of services to be 


implemented in the shopfloor and management service layers 


in the MIB architecture. Implementation Procedure consists 


of eight steps, as shown in Fig. 4, and some of which can be 


operated repeatedly according to the implementing procedure. 


The following are detailed descriptions of each step. 


 Goal and scope definition: Define the goal of the smart 
factory to be implemented and the scope of the system. 


The goal represents performances to be improved in the 


manufacturing system, and scope refers to the range of 


information the system has to include.  


 Build factory model: Build an As-Is model representing 
current features of the manufacturing system and a To-Be 


one representing the system after smart-factory 


implementation. In the latter model, the effect of the 


smart factory should be described. Each model has to 


show the factory elements, the level of each 


manufacturing process, and the manufacturing activity 


flow.  


 Identify information flow of As-Is factory model: Identify 
and describe the information flow between elements and 


activities in the current manufacturing system.  


 Identify information flow required for To-Be model: 
Identify and describe the information flow to achieve a 


goal from the perspective of the data acquisition, data 


analysis and application provided.

SECM provides services for managing the information of a 


manufacturing system. Through SECM services, it is possible 


to manage manufacturing process history, knowledge for 


operation and control, real-time manufacturing information, 


criteria for process evaluation, and maintenance information 


and knowledge. The delivery date can be controlled in 


conjunction with a process plan and performance can be 


evaluated on the entire manufacturing-system level. SECM 


generates reports for the operational results.

The MIB reference architecture presents the smart-factory 


services needed to improve productivity, environment, and 


social impact. However, not every manufacturing company 


needs to introduce all services at once when implementing a

 Identify smart factory services: Define the services that 
provide the information identified in step 4. Generally, 


two types of services are defined: generating information 


and transport. If all the information is identified, go to 


step 6; otherwise, go back to step 4.  


 Define MIB for smart factory: Define MIB architecture 
by organizing the identified systems and services. Define 


detailed information of each service and assign a system 


that will actually work. 


 Verify To-Be model information flow: Verify the 
information flow of the TO-BE model and whether all 


information and services have been defined sufficiently to 


achieve the goal. If not, go back to step 4. 


 Implement service: Implement MIB and the service 
systems. 


4. CASE STUDY 


To show the effect of MIB architecture and implementation 


methodology, a case study has been conducted for general 


maintenance activity. Currently a maintainer does operations 


without any help of IT, and brings himself procedure and 


manual for the operations. Now the company is trying to 


build smart maintenance system which automatically notice 


the breakdown and inform the maintainer what to do. A smart 


factory system and MIB architecture will be developed by 


following implementation procedure described in section 3. 


In goal and scope definition, the goal is defined as to provide 


maintenance procedure and manual automatically to 


maintainer when machine breakdown. The system includes 


maintainer, resource and information system as scope. In 


build factory model, As-Is and To-Be factory model are 


defined (Fig. 5).  Currently, maintainer checks the machine 


breakdown and does maintenance using paper manual. When 


smart factory has been adapted, the machine checks the 


breakdown by itself, and inform to information system. The 


information system generates maintenance procedure and 


manual, and assigns to maintainer. The maintainer does 


operations according to procedure and manual received. 


In identify information flow of As-Is factory model, only 


factory elements can be found since there is no information 


flow in As-Is model (Fig. 6 left). In identify information flow 


in To-Be model, and in identify smart factory services, 3 of 


information flow and 3 of service are identified (Fig. 6 right). 


As a first, the maintainer needs maintenance procedure and 


manual, and they are defined as d1, and d2. Maintenance 


Management of SECM is needed to generate d1 and d2, and 


it is defined as one of service. To operate Maintenance 


Management, Machine breakdown notice is required, and 


defined as d3. Similarly, Resource Monitoring of SMC, d4. 


Unforeseen event notice, d5. Sensor data, d6. Resource 


Signal data, Sensor & Resource Signal Acquisition, and 


Unforeseen event detection of resource agent is figured out 


sequentially. 


In define MIB for smart factory, tailored architecture is 


defined using data and services (Fig. 6 bottom). In verify To-


Be model information flow, all data flow from resource to 


maintainer is verified. Implementation of service is supposed 


to be operated in this study. 


In this case study, KPI can be defined as Mean time to repair 


(MTTR) based on ISO 22400 for general manufacturing 


purpose. In As-Is model, there are times to repair including 


t1: recognizing breakdown, t2: finding tools and manual, t3: 


approaching to machine and t4: repairing machine. Total time 


to repair is sum of t1 to t4. In To-Be model, the system itself 


recognize breakdown and provide manual automatically, so 


t1 and t2 are decreased dramatically. As a result, MTTR is 


decreased through MIB and services, which means that TPI is 


increased.

This paper developed the MIB architecture as an information 


middleware for smart factory. The architecture and its 


implementation procedure are useful in designing smart-


factory systems and identifying required services according 


to the purposes of stakeholders. MIB supports service 


exchanges as a middleware and provides lists of services, 


reflecting general requirements to improve the TPI in terms 


of productivity, environment, and social impact. 


The most novel aspect of MIB is that MIB aims to improve 


TPI according to the purpose of the stakeholder. Based on 


this property, it can support activities that improve 


productivity, environment, and sociality at the machine, 


factory, and enterprise levels, respectively. 


To realize MIB and smart factories it is necessary to develop 


technologies for factory elements. In particular, smart agent 


technology is needed to enable each element to provide a 


service. In addition, many platform technologies are needed 


to handle massive calls for services; basically platforms for 


machine learning, factory simulation, complex event 


processing, and distributed databases are needed, all of which 


are commonly required by current factories.
