Pythagorean fuzzy (PF) sets involving Pythagorean membership grades can befittingly manipulate inexact and 
equivocal information in real-life problems involving multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA). The linear 
programming technique for multidimensional analysis of preference (LINMAP) is a prototypical compromising 
model, and it is widely used to carry on decision-making problems in many down-to-earth applications. In 
LINMAP, the employment of squares of Euclidean distances is a significant technique that is an effective 
approach to fit measurements. Taking the advantages of a newly developed Euclidean distance model on the 
grounds of PF sets, this paper initiates a beneficial concept of squared PF Euclidean distances and studies its 
valuable and desirable properties. This paper aims to establish a squared Euclidean distance (SED)-based out-
ranking approach and develop a novel PF LINMAP methodology for handling an MCDA problem under PF un-
certainty. In the SED-based outranking approach, a novel SED-based dominance index is proposed to reflect an 
overall balance of a PF evaluative rating between the connection and remotest connection with positive- and 
negative-ideal ratings, respectively. The properties of the proposed index are also analyzed to exhibit its effi-
caciousness in determining the dominance relations for intracriterion comparisons. Moreover, this paper derives 
the comprehensive dominance index to determine the overall dominance relation and defines measurements of 
rank consistency for goodness of fit and rank inconsistency for poorness of fit. The PF LINMAP model is 
formulated to seek to ascertain the optimal weight vector that maximizes the total comprehensive dominance 
index and minimizes the poorness of fit under consideration of the lowest acceptable level and specialized 
degenerate weighting issues. The practical application concerning bridge-superstructure construction methods is 
conducted to test the feasibility and practicability of the PF LINMAP model. Over and above that, a general-
ization of the proposed methodology, along with applications to green supplier selection and railway project 
investment, is investigated to deal with group decision-making issues. Several comparative studies are imple-
mented to further validate its usefulness and advantages. The application and comparison results display the 
effectuality and flexibility of the developed PF LINMAP methodology. In the end, the directions for future 
research of this work are represented in the conclusion.   


1. Introduction 


Multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) scrutinizes making pref-
erence judgments among candidate alternatives that are evaluated by 
multiplex, usually conflicting, criteria (Liang et al., 2019; Lin et al., 
2019). MCDA problems are mainly concerned with diverse categories of 
decision-making issues, such as evaluation, prioritization, and selection, 


to give assistance in reaching the best compromise solution in many real 
applications (Akram et al., 2020a; Chen, 2018a; Chen, 2019b). MCDA 
models and methods play an important role in comparing, choosing, or 
ranking various competing alternatives based on specific criteria 
(Haghighi et al., 2019). Nonetheless, in numerous practical MCDA 
problems, an important matter in question that complicates the 
decision-making process is uncertainty, especially in intricate and

unpredictable circumstances (Chen, 2019a; Liang et al., 2019; Lin et al., 
2019). Because of a complex nature, a considerable amount of research 
in the MCDA field has focused on the development of appropriate 
techniques for dealing with decision-making uncertainty. One of the 
useful tools employed in addressing uncertain MCDA problems is Py-
thagorean fuzzy (PF) sets (Yager & Abbasov, 2013; Yager, 2013, 2014, 
2016). 


The concept of PF sets generalizes the notions of Atanassov’s intui-
tionistic fuzzy sets (Atanassov, 1986) to portray complicated uncertain 
information more effectively (Akram et al., 2020a, 2020b; Mandal & 
Ranadive, 2019). The theory of intuitionistic fuzzy sets, in which the 
sum of degrees of membership and non-membership is less than or equal 
to one, is the most widespread nonstandard fuzzy theory (Chen, 2019a). 
In contrast, PF sets composed of Pythagorean membership grades meet 
the situation that the sum of square degrees of membership and non- 
membership is less than or equal to one while the sum is not required 
to be less than one (Yager & Abbasov, 2013; Yager, 2014; Zhang & Xu, 
2014a). Owing to the relaxed prerequisite condition, PF sets can furnish 
more adaptability and flexibility than intuitionistic fuzzy sets for treat-
ing imprecise and ambiguous information and modeling the equivoca-
tion and vagueness in practice (Chen, 2019a; Mandal & Ranadive, 2019; 
Wang et al., 2019). Because it is beneficial to exploit PF sets to describe 
highly complicated uncertain information in realistic MCDA problems, 
numerous scholars have paid attention to extend the existing decision- 
making models and techniques to make them adapt a more compli-
cated environment involving Pythagorean fuzziness (Ding et al., 2019; 
Liang et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019). For example, Akram et al. (2020b) 
extended the elimination and choice translating reality method (ELEC-
TRE) to PF contexts and presented a group decision-making approach 
via the PF ELECTRE procedure. Furthermore, Chen (2020) originated 
new Chebyshev distance measures in PF settings and carried forward an 
extended PF ELECTRE approach. Biswas and Sarkar (2019) developed a 
new PF technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solutions 
(TOPSIS) to address group decision-aiding issues involving unknown 
weight information through entropy measures. Ho et al. (2020) 
advanced a Pearson-like correlation-based TOPSIS method under PF 
uncertainties with an interval-valued format. Akram et al. (2020a) 
exploited complex PF TOPSIS and complex PF ELECTRE to manipulate 
group decision-making problems. Büyüközkan and Göçer (2019) inte-
grated the complex proportional assessment and analytic hierarchy 
process (AHP) in PF contexts and explored the partner selection issue for 
digital supply chain. Shete et al. (2020) employed PF AHP to appraise 
the enablers of sustainable supply chain innovation. Chen (2019a) 
advanced a PF combinative distance-based precedence procedure and 
constructed an inventive preference ranking organization method for 
enrichment evaluations (PROMETHEE). Liang et al. (2020) proposed an 
expanded linear assignment method through the utility of partitioned 
fuzzy measures for MCDA with PF information. Mandal and Ranadive 
(2019) introduced the concept of PF preference relations for managing 
group decision analysis issues. Wang et al. (2019) established a novel 
group decision-making technique by use of PF linguistic variable Hamy 
mean operators and the Vise Kriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno 
Resenje (VIKOR) method. Yu et al. (2019) utilized an extensive TOPSIS 
on grounds of interval-valued PF sets to carry out multiple criteria group 
decision analysis for sustainable supplier selection. Zeb et al. (2019) 
initiated the concepts of credible extended PF sets and possible extended 
PF sets and provided an approach to MCDA with risk preference. 


There are many studies in the literature for the development and 
enrichment of the MCDA models and methods in uncertain PF contexts. 
However, there is limited research on an extension of the linear pro-
gramming technique for multidimensional analysis of preference (LIN-
MAP) to uncertain environments comprising of Pythagorean fuzziness. 
The LINMAP, launched by Srinivasan and Shocker (1973), is a renowned 
MCDA methodology to estimate the importance weights of criteria and 
decide the best compromise choice. The prominent attribute of LINMAP 
is the preference structure and information in regards to alternatives 


provided by the decision maker (Gou et al., 2019; Haghighi et al., 2019; 
Xue et al., 2018). Numerous MCDA models and techniques require the 
decision maker to reveal the intensity of relative preferences among 
multiple criteria and then determine the grades of relative importance 
via a weight assessment technique. In contrast, LINMAP postulates the 
decision maker to display subjective preference between two alterna-
tives (Liu et al., 2018; Song et al., 2018). By way of explanation, the 
input information of the LINMAP methods comprises a set of imposed 
consequences for paired preference of alternatives, and the weights of 
criteria and the ideal solutions are a priori unknowns. Supported by the 
given preference relations between alternatives, an easy-to-use linear 
programming method that aspires to attain the minimum inconsistency 
is formulated to determine the optimal criterion weights and the best 
compromise solution (Gou et al., 2019). The traditional LINMAP 
methodology has been advanced to a variety of uncertain surroundings, 
such as in the settings of hesitant fuzzy sets (Wan et al., 2017; Zhang & 
Xu, 2014b), hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (Xu et al., 2016), double 
hierarchy hesitant fuzzy linguistic term sets (Liu et al., 2018), probabi-
listic linguistic term sets (Liao et al., 2017), intuitionistic fuzzy sets (Wan 
& Li, 2014), interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (Wan & Li, 2015; 
Zhang, Ju, & Liu, 2016), PF sets (Wan et al., 2018; Xue et al., 2018), 
interval-valued PF sets (Xue et al., 2018), interval type-2 fuzzy sets 
(Haghighi et al., 2019; Qin et al., 2017), interval grey numbers (Song 
et al., 2018), and heterogeneous information (Zhang, Ju, Liu, & Gian-
nakis, 2017). 


The LINMAP methodology plays an essential role in information 
fusion of preference relations on alternatives and identification of the 
optimal weights and the best compromise solution for decision aiding 
and support. Nevertheless, the LINMAP methodology has not yet fully 
explored in the existing MCDA literature in uncertain circumstances on 
grounds of PF sets. Wan et al. (2018) and Xue et al. (2018), prior to the 
present time, have developed innovative LINMAP-based methods in the 
PF context. Based on fuzzy truth degrees, information entropy, and a 
cross-entropy optimization model, the characteristic of the LINMAP- 
based method presented by Wan et al. (2018) is that it exploits the 
inconsistency indices in accordance with the ideal solutions. To be 
specific, it incorporates the negative-ideal solution into the determina-
tion of the criterion weights. Additionally, the prominent feature of the 
PF LINMAP model originated by Xue et al. (2018) is consideration of the 
PF entropy that can conjecture the PF uncertain information. Their 
proposed linear programming model can acquire the solution result with 
the maximum consistency and reliability towards decision data. By 
reason of information insufficiency (e.g., lack of complete information, 
lack of clarity of information, and lack of consistent information), PF sets 
have been increasingly used in real-world MCDA problems, especially in 
a complicated and highly uncertain environment. However, except for 
Wan et al. (2018) and Xue et al. (2018), very few of the studies have 
focused on the LINMAP models and techniques with complex PF un-
certain information. This question constitutes the primary motivation of 
this paper. 


Notably, the PF LINMAP approaches presented by Wan et al. (2018) 
and Xue et al. (2018) consist of many complicated and interconnecting 
concepts, which would be intricate and not easily understood by deci-
sion makers. As an illustration, the noticeable core concept of their 
developed techniques is information entropy. Their methods are helpful 
and comprehensive to address group decision-making issues in PF un-
certain circumstances. However, their mathematical programming 
models are rather troublesome to implement for decision makers 
because their approaches require a lot of sophisticated concepts, such as 
cross-entropy and amount of knowledge. Additionally, the influence on 
the solution results and the technical character in the main LINMAP 
structure are not always well understood for decision makers, especially 
for less knowledgeable or less skilled practitioners. On account of these 
concerns, this paper would like to propose an easy-to-use approach for 
enriching the LINMAP methodology within the PF context and 
addressing MCDA problems in complex circumstances of Pythagorean

fuzziness. In contrast to the approaches proposed by Wan et al. (2018) 
and Xue et al. (2018), this paper attempts to exploit some simple con-
cepts such as squared PF Euclidean distances to manipulate Pythagorean 
membership grades and quantify the amount of rank consistency and 
rank inconsistency. This paper puts forward a novel squared-distance- 
based approach in PF settings and develops a new PF LINMAP method 
that is very clear and comprehensible for the decision maker. 


There are several ways to measure separation between PF informa-
tion (e.g., Pythagorean membership grades or PF sets). The square of the 
standard Euclidean distance, which is recognized as the squared 
Euclidean distance (SED), is of central importance in comparing the 
closeness between various data points. Although the Euclidean distance 
can measure the ordinary distance between two positions in space, it is 
troublesome as there pertain to costly square and square root operations. 
In contrast, SED is not a metric for the reason that it does not satisfy the 
triangle inequality. Nonetheless, the Pythagorean theorem is simpler 
through the agency of squared distance because there is no square root, 
which implies that the square of Euclidean distance is differentiable. 
SED is a more general notion of distances; it is useful for comparing 
distances and for measuring similarity. In this regard, this paper utilizes 
a newly developed Euclidean distance model on grounds of PF sets to 
present a novel measurement of squared PF Euclidean distances and 
explores some important and desirable properties. An alternative 
approach based on squared PF Euclidean distances can be exploited to 
preclude the computation of square root and save the computational 
expenses in decision-making processes. Regarding the usefulness of 
Pythagorean membership grades in describing the ambiguous and un-
certain decision-making details as well as the efficacy of the LINMAP- 
based methods, the basic structure of LINMAP is advanced and 
enriched to the PF environment, and a new PF LINMAP model is pro-
posed by identifying the SED-based dominance index and providing a 
SED-based outranking approach. To reduce the computational 
complexity in manipulating PF data, this paper shows how SED can be 
effectively incorporated into the central procedure of the PF LINMAP 
methodology by means of several new concepts of (comprehensive) 
dominance indices, measures of rank consistency, measures of rank 
inconsistency, and fit measurements (consisting of goodness of fit and 
poorness of fit) in PF uncertain surroundings. 


The purpose of this research is to launch an efficacious PF LINMAP 
methodology using the conception of SED-based dominance indices and 
a SED-based outranking technique for handling an MCDA question 
containing PF uncertain information. The feature of the classical LIN-
MAP is that the decision maker would reveal a set of paired preference 
discernments over alternatives as input, while the output comprises a set 
of the optimal criterion weights. Accordingly, this paper attempts to 
address an MCDA problem which is formulated by PF evaluative ratings 
and the decision maker’s paired preference judgments towards alter-
natives within the uncertain environment of Pythagorean fuzziness. The 
Euclidean distance model is an essential part of the LINMAP method-
ology because the square of weighted Euclidean distances is employed to 
appraise the poorness and goodness of fit in the LINMAP model. This 
research utilizes a newly developed Euclidean distance measure on 
grounds of Pythagorean membership grades to present the concept of 
squared PF Euclidean distances and investigate several essential and 
valuable properties. Based on squared PF Euclidean distances from ideal 
ratings, this paper defines the SED-based dominance index and con-
structs a SED-based outranking approach for conducting intracriterion 
comparisons among alternatives. The outranking relationships based on 
the SED-based outranking approach builds a solid foundation of the 
theoretical framework of the PF LINMAP methodology. This paper 
specifies the comprehensive dominance index to measure comprehen-
sive dominance relations among alternatives in terms of multiple 
criteria. By use of such comprehensive indices, this paper provides 
measurements of rank consistency and rank inconsistency with respect 
to each ordered pair of alternatives for the sake of determining fit 
measurements. This paper identifies the degrees of goodness of fit and 


poorness of fit by synthesizing consistency measures and inconsistency 
measures, respectively, over all ordered pairs. Next, this paper would 
like to originate a PF LINMAP model, which seeks to ascertain the 
optimal weights for criteria that maximizes the total comprehensive 
dominance index and minimizes the degree of poorness of fit under 
consideration of the lowest acceptable level and specialized degenerate 
weighting issues. Solving the optimization problem, the optimal crite-
rion weights and degrees of violation for each ordered pair would be 
derived to generate the priority orders of competing alternatives and 
identify the best compromise choice. Based on the aforementioned 
concepts, a new PF LINMAP methodology using a SED-based outranking 
technique can be formulated to solve complex uncertain MCDA prob-
lems comprising Pythagorean fuzziness. Subsequently, a down-to-earth 
application relating to an MCDA issue of choosing a bridge- 
superstructure construction method is investigated to corroborate the 
workableness and effectuality of the PF LINMAP model. Furthermore, 
this paper implements certain comparative studies consisting of the first 
sensitivity analysis concerning the non-negative boundary conditions of 
criterion weights, the second sensitivity analysis concerning the relative 
significance of the total comprehensive dominance in regards to the 
poorness of fit under various lowest acceptable levels. Over and above 
that, the proposed methodology would be generalized to tackle group 
decision-making problems for enriching more efficaciousness in prac-
tice. This paper executes several valuable comparative analyses con-
cerning the application results yielded by other pertinent MCDA 
methods. The comparison results can verify the flexibility and advan-
tages of the PF LINMAP methodology. 


The main contributions of the developed PF LINMAP methodology 
are outlined as follows: (i) The proposed SED-based dominance index 
can reflect an overall counterpoise between the association towards the 
positive-ideal PF evaluative rating and the remotest association towards 
the negative-ideal PF evaluative rating; (ii) The developed SED-based 
outranking approach can effectively manipulate complex PF informa-
tion and determine (comprehensive) dominance relations among PF 
evaluative ratings and among alternatives; (iii) The new fit measure-
ments in the PF context can synthesize the measures of rank consistency 
for goodness of fit and rank inconsistency for poorness of fit over all 
ordered pairs, which are reliable, comprehensive, and in accordance 
with the paired preference relations; (iv) The proposed PF LINMAP 
methodology can manage MCDA and group decision-making problems 
despite the existence of non-transitive or inconsistent relations among 
pairwise preferences of alternatives; and (v) The novel PF LINMAP 
optimization model can coordinate the maximal objective of the total 
comprehensive dominance index and the minimal objective of the de-
gree of poorness of fit, which guarantees that the obtained PF LINMAP 
rankings can retain the original preference judgments indicated by the 
decision maker as much as possible. 


The remainder of this paper is organized as below. Section 2 delivers 
certain fundamental concepts that are in connection with PF sets. Based 
on squared PF Euclidean distances, Section 3 proposes a SED-based 
dominance index to develop a SED-based outranking approach on 
grounds of PF sets. Section 4 establishes the PF LINMAP approach based 
on new concepts of the comprehensive dominance index, the measures 
of rank consistency/inconsistency, the degree of goodness of fit, and the 
degree of poorness of fit. An effective linear programming model is 
formulated to acquire the optimal criterion weights and determine the 
best compromise alternative. Section 5 depicts a realistic MCDA prob-
lem concerning bridge-superstructure construction to display the 
calculation procedure of the proposed methods and techniques. A 
comparison analysis with other relevant approaches and some 
comparative discussions in different parameter settings are executed to 
perform the applicability and adaptability of the developed PF LINMAP 
methodology. Furthermore, a generalization to the group decision- 
making field is further investigated; moreover, two practical applica-
tions of green supplier selection and railway project investment are 
implemented for making more comprehensive comparisons. Section 6

conveys the conclusions and some directions for future research. 


2. Preliminary 


Yager (2013, 2014, 2016) and Yager and Abbasov (2013) introduced 
a class of nonstandard membership grades that are named as Pythago-
rean membership grades, which can be delineated by five parameters: 
the degrees of membership, non-membership, and indeterminacy, the 
strength of commitment about membership, and the direction of 
commitment (Chen, 2019a, 2019b; Li & Zeng, 2018; Yager & Abbasov, 
2013; Yager, 2014; Zeng et al., 2018). Zhang and Xu (2014a) depicted a 
helpful mathematical representation towards PF sets. On the grounds of 
the representation, Chen (2019a, 2019b) provided more comprehensive 
definitions in connection with Pythagorean membership grades in PF 
settings. Due to the duality of the strength of commitment and the de-
gree of indeterminacy, Chen (2019a, 2019b) considered the four pa-
rameters (i.e., degrees of membership and non-membership, strength, 
and direction) to contribute an operationally mathematical representa-
tion with relevance to a Pythagorean membership grade. This section 
delivers several fundamental concepts including PF representations and 
scalar-valued functions. These notations and conceptions are necessary 
for the succeeding analysis. 


Definition 1. ((Chen, 2019a, 2019b; Yager & Abbasov, 2013; Yager, 
2014)) A PF set P is delineated by a set of ordered parameters 
involving the degree of membership μP(x), the degree of non- 
membership νP(x), the strength of commitment rP(x), and the direc-
tion of commitment dP(x), in a finite universe of discourse X, where 
μP(x),νP(x), rP(x),dP(x) ∈[0, 1]; it is expressed as below: 


P = {〈x, (μP(x), νP(x); rP(x), dP(x)) 〉 |x ∈ X }, (1) 


subject to the succeeding constraint:

The degree of indeterminacy τP(x) ∈ [0, 1] of the element x ∈ X to the 
set P is stated as below: 


τP(x) =

Definition 2. ((Chen, 2019a, 2019b; Yager & Abbasov, 2013; Yager, 
2014)) Let X be a finite universe of discourse. A Pythagorean mem-
bership grade, which is denoted by p, of element x ∈ X in a PF set P is 
represented as below: 


p = (μP(x), νP(x); rP(x), dP(x)); (4)  


moreover, the corresponding parameters are real-valued functions 
depending on x, as below: 


μP(x) = rP(x)⋅cos(θP(x)), (5)  


νP(x) = rP(x)⋅sin(θP(x)), (6)  


rP(x) =

where θP(x) is remarked in radians in the range [0,π/2]. 
The Pythagorean membership grade p is featured by four parameters, 


i.e., membership μP(x), non-membership νP(x), strength rP(x), and di-
rection dP(x), according to the above definition. Moreover, the radians 
θP(x) in p can be determined by providing dP(x), by μP(x) and rP(x), or by 
νP(x) and rP(x), in the following manner: 


θP(x) =

Fig. 1 depicts a geometrical explication about the Pythagorean 
membership space. By way of illustration, the Pythagorean membership 
grade p = (μP(x), νP(x); rP(x), dP(x)) is regarded as a point (in the upper 
right quadrant) on a circle of radius rP(x). The direction dP(x) signifies 
on a commitment scale in [0, 1] to reveal the extent of the strength rP(x)
at pointing towards membership. The strength rP(x) is completely to-
wards membership and non-membership in the cases of dP(x) = 1 and 
dP(x) = 0, respectively, while an intermediate value of dP(x) represents 
partial support towards membership and non-membership. Further-
more, μP(x) and νP(x) actually related through Pythagorean comple-
ments with reference to rP(x) due to (μP(x))

2⋅(cos2(θP(x)) + sin2(θP(x))) = (rP(x))


2. Over and above that, the 
complement pc of p is stated as follows: 


pc = (μPc (x), νPc (x); rPc (x), dPc (x)) = (νP(x), μP(x); rP(x), 1 − dP(x)) (10) 


To determine a scalar value affiliated with the Pythagorean mem-
bership grade p, Yager (2013, 2014) exploited the Takagi–Sugeno 
approach to initiate the scalar-valued function V(p) on account of fuzzy 
rule bases. Zeng et al. (2018) investigated four existing comparison 
methods for ranking Pythagorean membership grades, consisting of the 
approaches by way of score functions, using score and accuracy func-
tions, using closeness indices, and using scalar-valued functions. They 
indicated that the ranking result based on the scalar-valued function is 
more credible than that obtained by the other comparison methods. 
Because the effectiveness of the scalar-valued function has been 
demonstrated by Zeng et al. (2018), one can conveniently employ V(p) 
to compare the magnitude of Pythagorean membership grades. Based on

the grounds of PF sets. To be specific, this section contrives an MCDA 
problem involving PF uncertain information and reveals stated prefer-
ence information between pairs of alternatives. Through the utility of 
the Euclidean distance measures as regards to Pythagorean membership 
grades, this section introduces squared PF Euclidean distances and in-
quires into valuable and desirable properties. This section mentions the 
concept of SED-based dominance indices and constructs a SED-based 
outranking approach in PF circumstances. The advanced SED-based 
outranking approach can supply a substantial theoretical foundation, 
as revealed in Fig. 2. This figure sketches pertinent concepts of squared 
PF Euclidean distances and SED-based dominance indices. Some useful 
properties in the developed theorems facilitate the construction of the 
core structure in the PF LINMAP methodology in the subsequent study. 


3.1. Problem description 


This subsection institutes an MCDA problem through the utility of PF 
sets in which the evaluative ratings of alternatives in relevance to 


criteria are described as Pythagorean membership grades. As opposed to 
most MCDA problems that involves preference information about 
criteria, the developed PF LINMAP methodology requires different types 
of preference information. To put it another way, the importance 
weights towards multiple criteria are a priori unknowns and must be 
determined in the investigated problem. In particular, the proposed 
techniques require decision makers to provide preference information 
across the alternatives. Accordingly, this subsection represents the de-
cision maker’s paired preference discernments via the stated assess-
ments between alternatives. Simply stated, in the MCDA problem under 
study, the input of the proposed methods comprises the characteristics 
of all candidate alternatives by use of PF sets and a set of paired pref-
erence discernments in connection with competing alternatives. 


Let Z = {z1, z2,⋯, zm} and C = {c1, c2,⋯, cn} indicate a discrete set 
of m candidate alternatives and a finite set of n evaluative criteria, 
respectively. To be specific, the set C is separated into two disjoint sets, 
namely, CI and CII, where CI ∩ CII = ∅ and CI ∪ CII = C. Here, CI and CII 
indicate a collection of benefit criteria and a collection of cost criteria,

respectively. For each cj ∈ CI, a higher Pythagorean membership grade 
of cj signifies a stronger preference, whereas for each cj ∈ CII, a higher 
Pythagorean membership grade reveals a weaker preference. Let wj be 
the importance weight of each criterion cj ∈ C, which meets the 
normalization conditions, i.e., 0⩽wj⩽1 for all j ∈ {1,2,⋯, n} and 
∑n


j=1wj = 1. Note that the importance weights are a priori unknowns 
and need to be resolved. 


Consider an MCDA problem with convoluted uncertainty involving 
Pythagorean fuzziness. The PF evaluative rating of an alternative zi ∈ Z 
in the matter of a criterion cj ∈ C is denoted as Cj(zi) for i ∈ {1,2,⋯,m}
and j ∈ {1,2,⋯,n}. It is portrayed as a Pythagorean membership grade as 
follows: 


Cj(zi) =
(
μcj (zi), νcj (zi); rcj (zi), dcj (zi)


)
(12) 


The four parameters of Cj(zi) (i.e., the degree of membership μcj (zi), 
the degree of non-membership νcj (zi), the strength of commitment rcj (zi), 
and the direction of commitment dcj (zi)) are real-valued functions that 
are evaluated towards zi in terms of cj, where μcj (zi), νcj (zi), rcj (zi),
dcj (zi) ∈[0, 1]. The degree of indeterminacy in connection with each 


Cj(zi) is τcj (zi) =
̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅
1 − (μcj (zi))

− (νcj (zi))

√


. In accordance with Defini-


tion 2, the following relationships are satisfied: μcj (zi) =
rcj (zi)⋅cos(θcj (zi)), νcj (zi) = rcj (zi)⋅sin(θcj (zi)), rcj (zi) =
̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅
(μcj (zi))

+ (νcj (zi))

, and dcj (zi) = (π − 2⋅θcj (zi))/π for θcj (zi) ∈ [0,π/2]. 
For notational convenience, let pij = Cj(zi) in the following discussion, 
where pij = (μij,νij; rij,dij). That is, the notations μcj (zi), νcj (zi), rcj (zi), and 
dcj (zi) are denoted with μij, νij, rij, and dij, respectively, for simplicity. 


By collecting the PF evaluative rating pij over all cj ∈ C, the charac-
teristic Pi of the alternative zi is described as follows: 


Pi =
{〈


cj, pij
〉 ⃒
⃒cj ∈ C


}
=
{〈


cj, (μij, νij; rij, dij)
〉 ⃒
⃒cj ∈ C


}
(13) 


Let Ω represent a set of ordered pairs (ϕ, φ). The decision maker 
provides the paired preference relations towards the alternatives in the 
set Z with Ω, as follows: 


Ω =
{(


ϕ,φ)
⃒
⃒
⃒zϕ≻ zφ, ϕ,φ ∈ {1, 2,⋯,m}


}
, (14)  


in which the preference relation zϕ≻ zφ indicates that zϕ is noninferior to 
zφ. In other words, either zϕ is preferred to zφ or zϕ and zφ are identically 
preferred. 


The preference relations zϕ≻ zφ in the set Ω are designated by the 
decision maker’s subjective discernments. Theoretically, there are no 
more than m(m − 1)/2 paired comparison judgments in Ω. However, in 
realistic decision-making problems, incomplete judgments often occur 
because of various factors such as the incomplete information and 
limited expertise and knowledge. Thus, it is not indispensable to 
postulate the decision maker to indicate all preference relations for each 
pairs of alternatives. On the other side, the decision maker sometimes 
depicts non-transitive paired comparison judgments because of the ex-
istence of non-transitive relations among pairwise preferences in prac-
tice. Note that the transitivity does not always hold when multiple 
criteria are evaluated, which implies that the preference relations pro-
vided by the decision maker might be inconsistent. For this reason, in 
addition to the incomplete judgment estimation, the proposed meth-
odology can cope with the inconsistency issue among preference re-
lations in the set Ω. Given the characteristics composed of PF evaluative 
ratings and the paired preference discernments over the alternatives, 
this paper advances a SED-based outranking approach using squared PF 
Euclidean distances and presents a new PF LINMAP method for tackling 
MCDA problems with uncertainty involving Pythagorean fuzziness. 


3.2. Squared PF Euclidean distances 


This subsection introduces the current PF distance measures between 
Pythagorean membership grades on the grounds of the Euclidean dis-
tance model. Next, this subsection employs a newly developed 
Euclidean distance measure on grounds of PF sets to propose the concept 
of squared PF Euclidean distances and explore several helpful and 
appealing properties. 


On account of the fact that the conventional LINMAP procedure 
belongs to ideal-solution based models; moreover, it utilizes the square 
of the weighted Euclidean distance between an alternative and the ideal 
solution to appraise the measurements on poorness of fit and goodness of 
fit. Accordingly, the Euclidean distance model is capable of playing a key 
role in LINMAP-based approaches. To manipulate PF information, this 
paper briefly reviews the current Euclidean distance models for facili-
tating the LINMAP analysis. In the PF context, some Euclidean distance 
measures have been proposed so far for appropriately measuring the 
separation between PF information. For example, Ren et al. (2016) 
considered the individual differences between square degrees of mem-
bership, between square degrees of non-membership, and between 
square degrees of indeterminacy to introduce the Euclidean distance for 
PF sets. By extending their definition, Chen (2018c) presented a 
generalized PF distance measure for appraising separation magnitudes 
between Pythagorean membership grades through the agency of the 
Minkowski distance model with a distance parameter. Analogously, 
Wan et al. (2018) introduced (weighted) Minkowski distance measures 
for PF sets. When the distance parameter is equal to two, Chen (2018c) 
generalized PF distance measure and Wan et al. (2018) Minkowski 
distance measure reduce to Ren et al. (2016) Euclidean distance mea-
sure. However, a key critical issue for the appropriateness of the 
aforementioned Euclidean distances is the ignorance of the distinct at-
tributes of PF sets. Specifically, the strength and direction of commit-
ment possessed by a Pythagorean membership grade have not been 
incorporated into the specifications of the PF Euclidean distance model. 


In this regard, Li and Zeng (2018) and Zeng et al. (2018) developed 
more comprehensive generalized PF distance measures with a distance 
parameter in the PF contexts. Analogously, when the distance parameter 
is equal to two, both generalized PF distance measures reduce to the 
Euclidean distance that is different from the measure proposed by Ren 
et al. (2016). To be precise, Li and Zeng (2018) premeditated the 
strength and direction of commitment to propose a new generalized 
distance measure (involving the Euclidean distance) for PF sets. They 
employed the individual differences between degrees of membership, 
degrees of non-membership, strengths of commitment, and between 
directions of commitment to present a normalized measure for Pythag-
orean membership grades. However, Li and Zeng did not consider the 
influences of the square degrees of membership and non-membership, as 
well as the square of strengths of commitment, in their distance mea-
surements. Moreover, their normalization approach would underrate 
the extent of the normalized distances. On the other side, Zeng et al. 
(2018) incorporated five elementary parameters featured by Pythago-
rean membership grades into the identification of PF distance measures 
that involves the Euclidean distance. The respective differences between 
the membership degrees, non-membership degrees, indeterminacy de-
grees, strengths of commitment, and between directions of commitment 
are simultaneously employed in identifying a normalized generalized 
distance measure for PF sets. Nonetheless, Zeng et al. (2018) did not 
consider the squared differences in the five fundamental parameters. 
Another important issue to address is the double weighting question of 
the strength of commitment and the degree of indeterminacy. Because of 
the dual concepts (i.e., the indeterminacy degree is equal to one minus 
the strength of commitment), the distance measure proposed by Zeng 
et al. would bring about unreasonable computation results of PF dis-
tances. Analogous to Li and Zeng (2018), the normalization technique 
adopted by Zeng et al. (2018) would underestimate the extent of the 
normalized distances.

To surmount the above-mentioned difficulty and limitations, Chen 
(2019a, 2019b) employed the fundamental characteristics of PF sets, 
namely, membership, non-membership, strength, and direction, to 
propose an innovative generalized distance measure on grounds of PF 
sets. In conformity with the application and comparative results, Chen 
demonstrated the effectiveness and practicability of the developed 
generalized distance measure. Compared to the other existing PF dis-
tance measures, this newly developed measure has the strong points of 
stipulating an opportune normalization approach, handling the double 
weighting question, and exploiting the square terms concerning Py-
thagorean membership degrees; moreover, it provides a flexible and 
effective measure for quantifying the separation between PF informa-
tion. Therefore, this paper originates the generalized distance measure 
proposed by Chen (2019a, 2019b) to put forward the squared PF 
Euclidean distance for PF sets. 


On grounds of the Euclidean distance model in the generalized dis-
tance measure by Chen (2019a, 2019b) (i.e., in case when the distance 
parameter is equal to two), the following definition presents the 
normalized PF Euclidean distance measure D and the squared PF 
Euclidean distance measure S between PF evaluative ratings. In partic-
ular, the distance measure D is identified through the utility of a four- 
term representation. That is, the degrees of membership and non- 
membership, the strength of commitment, and the direction of 
commitment are considered in quantifying the measure D, which is a 
positive function (also called metric) from pairs of Pythagorean mem-
bership grades. 


Definition 4. Let two Pythagorean membership grades pϕj (= (μϕj,νϕj;
rϕj, dϕj)) and pφj (= (μφj, νφj; rφj, dφj)) be the PF evaluative ratings of al-
ternatives zϕ and zφ, respectively, in connection with a criterion cj, 
where zϕ, zφ ∈ Z and cj ∈ C. The normalized PF Euclidean distance D(pϕj,
pφj) between pϕj and pφj is expounded as follows:   


Moreover, the squared PF Euclidean distance S(pϕj, pφj) (=
(D(pϕj, pφj))

Example 1. Consider two PF evaluative ratings pϕj=(0.5142, 0.6984; 
0.8673, 0.4040) and pφj=(0.8277, 0.3815; 0.9114, 0.7250). From 
Definition 4, the normalized PF Euclidean distance D(pϕj, pφj)={(1/3) 
⋅[(0.51422 –0.82772)2+(0.69842 –0.38152)2+(0.86732 –0.91142)2 


+(0.40402 –0.72502)2)]}0.5 = 0.3667. The squared PF Euclidean dis-
tance S(pϕj, pφj)=(1/3)⋅[(0.51422 –0.82772)2+(0.69842 –0.38152)2 


+(0.86732 –0.91142)2+(0.40402 –0.72502)2)] = 0.1344. 


Theorem 1. The normalized PF Euclidean distance measure D between 
two PF evaluative ratings pϕj and pφj fulfills the succeeding properties: 


(T1.1) Boundedness: 0⩽D(pϕj,pφj)⩽1; 
(T1.2) Reflexivity: D(pϕj,pϕj) = 0; 
(T1.3) Separability: D(pϕj, pφj) = 0 if and only if pϕj = pφj; 
(T1.4) Symmetry: D(pϕj,pφj) = D(pφj,pϕj). 


Proof. Refer to the proof process in Chen (2019b). 


Remark. The squared PF Euclidean distance measure S between two 
PF evaluative ratings pϕj and pφj fulfills the succeeding properties: 


(R.1) Boundedness: 0⩽S(pϕj,pφj)⩽1; 
(R.2) Reflexivity: S(pϕj,pϕj) = 0; 
(R.3) Separability: S(pϕj, pφj) = 0 if and only if pϕj = pφj; 
(R.4) Symmetry: S(pϕj,pφj) = S(pφj,pϕj). 


Properties (R.1)–(R.4) are fulfilled based on (T1.1)–(T1.4), respec-
tively. The squared PF Euclidean distance measure S is not a metric, but 
is a semimetric because S(pϕj, pφj) satisfies the prerequisite conditions of 
reflexivity, separability, and symmetry. 


In addition to the properties (T1.1)–(T1.4), the main advantage of 
the normalized PF Euclidean distance measure D is that it can measure 
the ordinary distance between Pythagorean membership degrees in a PF 
space. However, the use of the measure D is troublesome as there pertain 
to costly square and square root operations. For this reason, the concept 
of squared PF Euclidean distances towards Pythagorean membership 
degrees will be exploited to keep away from the computation of square 
root for simplicity. Especially, in the PF context, the Pythagorean the-
orem is simpler in connection with the squared PF Euclidean distance 
measure S because there is no square root. One useful application of the 
measure S is to compare the dissimilarity between various PF evaluative 
ratings. Therefore, the measurement of squared PF Euclidean distances 
will be adopted to reduce computational complexity.

Proof. For (T2.1), based on (10), one has dcϕj = 1 − dϕj and d
c
φj = 1 − dφj 


for two complements pcϕj and p

Thus, (T2.1) is valid. For (T2.2), the radians θϕj and θφj that are 
associated with pϕj and pφj, respectively, can be gained using (9), i.e., 
θϕj = π(1 − dϕj)/2 and θφj = π(1 − dφj)/2. According to dcϕj = 1 − dϕj and 
dcφj = 1 − dφj, it can be inferred that θ

Thus, (T2.2) is correct. For (T2.3), it is recognized that pcϕj = (νϕj, μϕj;

Thus, (T2.3) is fulfilled, which completes the proof. 
Chen (2018c) expounded a complete lattice as a partially ordered set 


in such a manner that a non-empty PF subset has a supremum and an 
infimum. Based on the Pythagorean identity, i.e., sin2(θij) + cos2(θij) =
1, it can be obtained that (μij)


2
+ (νij)2 = (rij)2⋅(sin2(θij)+ cos2(θij)) =


(rij)
2⩽1. Analogous to Chen (2018c), this paper construes the lattice 


(LPF ,⩽LPF ) with the partial order ⩽LPF for non-empty Pythagorean mem-
bership degrees in a PF set as follows: 


LPF =
{(


μij, νij; rij, dij)
⃒
⃒μij, νij, rij, dij ∈ [0, 1], (μij)


2
+ (νij)

For any PF evaluative ratings pϕj = (μϕj, νϕj; rϕj, dϕj)∈ LPF and pφj =
(μφj,νφj; rφj,dφj) ∈ LPF, the partial order pϕj⩽LPF pφj if and only if μϕj⩽μφj and 
νϕj⩾νφj. Nonetheless, such orderings regarding PF evaluative ratings do 
not constantly take place in PF surroundings. As an illustration, consider 
pϕj=(0.51, 0.47; 0.69, 0.53) and pφj=(0.62, 0.73; 0.96, 0.45). Because μϕj 
(=0.51) < μφj (=0.62) and νϕj (=0.47) < νφj (=0.73), the partial order 
does not exist between pϕj and pφj, namely, neither pϕj⩽LPF pφj nor 
pφj⩽LPF pϕj holds. The main issue lies in this example is the differentiation 
between PF evaluative ratings. It frequently happens that the dominance 


relationships cannot be ascertained based on inequalities between the 
membership functions. To differentiate the dominance relationships for 
PF information, this paper would like to advance a new concept of SED- 
based dominance indices to implement effectual comparisons on the 
subject of PF evaluative ratings. 


On the other side, the directions of commitment dϕj and dφj depict on 
a scale of 0 to 1 how entirely the strengths rϕj and rφj, respectively, are 
pointing toward membership. It follows that dϕj⩽dφj because μϕj⩽μφj. 
Based on θϕj = (π/2)⋅(1 − dϕj) and θφj = (π/2)⋅(1 − dφj), one obtains 
θϕj⩾θφj because π is a constant. It is noted that the bottom and top ele-
ments of (LPF,⩽LPF ) are (0,1;1,0) and (1,0;1,1), respectively. This in-
dicates that Pythagorean membership degrees (0,1;1,0) and (1,0;1,1) 
are the lowest and highest PF evaluative ratings, respectively, in (LPF ,
⩽LPF ). 


Theorem 3. Let (LPF ,⩽LPF ) be a partially ordered set in the universe of 
discourse. Let three Pythagorean membership degrees pϕj, pγj, and pφj be 
the PF evaluative ratings, where pϕj, pγj, and pφj are affiliated with LPF 
that involves the partial order ⩽LPF . If pϕj⩽LPF pγj⩽LPF pφj, then 
S(pϕj, pγj)⩽S(pϕj, pφj) and S(pγj,pφj)⩽S(pϕj,pφj). 


Proof. Because pϕj, pγj, and pφj are affiliated with LPF that contains the 
partial order ⩽LPF , the condition pϕj⩽LPF pγj⩽LPF pφj holds if and only if 0⩽ 
μϕj⩽μγj⩽μφj⩽1 and 1⩾νϕj⩾νγj⩾νφj⩾0. Moreover, it is known that 0⩽dϕj⩽ 
dγj⩽dφj⩽1 from μϕj⩽μγj⩽μφj. The following results are obtained:

In accordance with these results, it is concluded that S(pϕj,pγj)⩽S(pϕj,
pφj) holds. The inequality S(pγj,pφj)⩽S(pϕj,pφj) can be proved just the 
same. This completes the proof. 


Example 2. Let three Pythagorean membership grades pϕj = (0.2124, 
0.8436; 0.8699, 0.1570), pγj = (0.3978, 0.7534; 0.8520, 0.3093), and 
pϕj = (0.5407, 0.6176; 0.8208, 0.4578) be the PF evaluative ratings. By 
utilizing Definition 4, it is calculated that S(pϕj, pγj) = 0.0192, S(pγj, pφj) 
= 0.0258, and S(pϕj, pφj) = 0.0892. One can see that the two inequalities 
S(pϕj, pγj)⩽S(pϕj, pφj) and S(pγj, pφj)⩽S(pϕj, pφj) are satisfied. 


The squared PF Euclidean distance S(pϕj, pφj) between pϕj and pφj is 
similar to metrics, but it does not possess the property of triangle 
inequality. Yet, in spite of this, it is a more general conception of

distance and can be used to describe a natural quasi-ordering between 
Pythagorean membership grades, namely pϕj⩽LPF pφj if and only if μϕj⩽μφj 
and νϕj⩾νφj. Moreover, the Pythagorean theorem is simpler through the 
agency of the squared distance measure. As proven in Theorem 3, it is 
advisable to employ S(pϕj, pφj) to capture the separation between PF 
evaluative ratings. There is one more thing to be noted here. Because the 
most canonical Bregman divergence is the squared Euclidean distance, 
the proposed S(pϕj, pφj) can facilitate forming an important class of di-
vergences in the PF context for future research. 


3.3. SED-based dominance indices 


On the strength of the proposed squared PF Euclidean distance, this 
subsection attempts to construct a SED-based dominance index and 
present a SED-based outranking approach in the PF decision context. 


Because (0,1;1,0) and (1,0;1,1) are the bottom and top elements, 
respectively, of (LPF ,⩽LPF ), they are considered as the lowest and highest 
Pythagorean membership grades, respectively. Accordingly, the posi-
tive- and negative-ideal PF evaluative ratings are designated as (1,0;1,1) 
and (0,1;1,0), respectively, regarding benefit criteria. On the contrary, 
the positive- and negative-ideal PF evaluative ratings are designated as 
(0,1;1,0) and (1,0;1,1), respectively, for cost criteria. Motivated by the 
idea of closeness coefficient in the TOPSIS, this paper contrives an 
innovative concept of SED-based dominance indices and inquires into 
several useful properties. The advanced dominance indices furnish a 
basis for formulating the succeeding PF LINMAP method and 
techniques. 


Definition 5. Let p+j and p− j denote the positive- and negative-ideal PF 
evaluative ratings, respectively, in relation to each criterion cj ∈ C; they 
are expounded as below: 


p+j = (μ+j, ν+j; r+j, d+j) =
{
(1, 0; 1; 1) for cj ∈ CI,
(0, 1; 1, 0) for cj ∈ CII;


(18)  


p− j = (μ− j, ν− j; r− j, d− j) =
{
(0, 1; 1, 0) for cj ∈ CI,
(1, 0; 1; 1) for cj ∈ CII.


(19)  


Theorem 4. Consider the characteristic Pi for all zi ∈ Z, in which Pi = {
〈cj,pij〉|cj ∈ C} = {〈cj,(μij,νij; rij,dij)〉|cj ∈ CI ∪ CII}. The PF evaluative rating 
pij, the positive-ideal PF evaluative rating p+j, and the negative-ideal PF 
evaluative rating p− j fulfill the following quasi-orderings, and the squared PF 
Euclidean distances between them have the following relations: 


(T4.1) p− j⩽LPF pij⩽LPF p+j for cj ∈ CI; 
(T4.2) p+j⩽LPF pij⩽LPF p− j for cj ∈ CII; 
(T4.3) S(pij, p− j)⩽S(p− j, p+j) and S(pij, p+j)⩽S(p− j, p+j) for cj ∈ C. 


Proof. For (T4.1), it is cognized that pij, p+j, and p− j are affiliated with 
LPF that involves the partial order ⩽LPF . For each benefit criterion cj ∈ CI, 
inequalities μ− j⩽μij⩽μ+j and ν− j⩾νij⩾ν+j hold because μ− j = ν+j = 0 and 
μ+j = ν− j = 1. As a result, p− j⩽LPF pij⩽LPF p+j is valid. For (T4.2), in-
equalities μ− j⩾μij⩾μ+j and ν− j⩽νij⩽ν+j are satisfied for each cost criterion 
cj ∈ CII because μ− j = ν+j = 1 and μ+j = ν− j = 0, which indicates that 
p+j⩽LPF pij⩽LPF p− j. For (T4.3), it is received that S(p− j, pij) =S(pij, p− j) and 
p− j⩽LPF pij⩽LPF p+j for cj ∈ CI from (R.4) and (T4.1), respectively. Thus, 
S(pij, p− j)⩽S(p− j, p+j) and S(pij, p+j)⩽S(p− j, p+j) hold for cj ∈ CI according 
to Theorem 3. Analogously, the above two relations are valid for each 
cj ∈ CII because S(p+j, pij) = S(pij, p+j) and p+j⩽LPF pij⩽LPF p− j. Therefore, 
(T4.3) is correct for cj ∈ C, which completes the proof.

Theorem 5. For two PF evaluative ratings pϕj and pφj in connection with 
cj ∈ C ( = CI ∪ CII), their squared PF Euclidean distances from the positive- 
ideal PF evaluative rating p+j and from the negative-ideal PF evaluative rating 
p− j meet the succeeding properties:

if pϕj⩽LPF pφj and

Proof. For (T5.1), one has 0⩽μϕj⩽μφj⩽1 and 1⩾νϕj⩾νφj⩾0 from the 
condition pϕj⩽LPF pφj. It is received that 0⩽dϕj⩽dφj⩽1 from μϕj⩽μφj.

using (21). If 


pϕj⩽LPF pφj and (τϕj)

2. Thus, (T5.1) is satisfied. Property (T5.2) can be 
demonstrated by analogy to (T5.1). For (T5.3), the condition pφj⩽LPF pϕj 
indicates that 1⩾μϕj⩾μφj⩾0 and 0⩽νϕj⩽νφj⩽1, which follows that 


1⩾dϕj⩾dφj⩾0. Regarding each cost criterion cj ∈ CII, one can yield S(pϕj,

and (τϕj)2⩾(τφj)2, it is easily corroborated that S(pϕj, p+j)⩾S(pφj, p+j)
because (μϕj)

2, i.e., (T5.3) is fulfilled. Property (T5.4) is demonstrated by 
analogy to (T5.3), which completes the proof. 


As proven in Theorem 5, the proposed squared PF Euclidean dis-
tances in the matter of p+j and p− j can render justified rankings in line

with the quasi-orderings defined in (LPF ,⩽LPF ). In particular, even if the 
condition concerning degrees of indeterminacy is not satisfied, the 
ranking results yielded by the squared PF Euclidean distances are more 
reasonable than other PF distance measures. Let us examine the 
following example. 


Example 3. Let two Pythagorean membership grades pϕj and pφj be the 
PF evaluative ratings of the alternatives zϕ and zφ, respectively, in terms 
of a benefit criterion cj, where pϕj=(0.1600, 0.3500; 0.3848, 0.2730) and 
pφj=(0.1610, 0.2000; 0.2568, 0.4315) in Case 1, pϕj=(0.3536, 0.3536; 
0.5000, 0.5000) and pφj=(0.3537, 0.3500; 0.4976, 0.5033) in Case 2, 
and pϕj=(0.5000, 0.6000; 0.7810, 0.4423) and pφj=(0.5100, 0.4000; 
0.6482, 0.5766) in Case 3. It displays that the partial order pϕj⩽LPF pφj 
holds in Cases 1–3. However, the condition (τϕj)2⩾(τφj)2 is not satisfied 
because τϕj = 0.9230 and τφj = 0.9665 in Case 1, τϕj = 0.8660 and τφj =
0.8674 in Case 2, and τϕj = 0.6245 and τφj = 0.7615 in Case 3. Although 
one of the preconditions in (T5.1) is not satisfied, the concept of scalar- 
valued functions in Definition 3 can facilitate the comparison of the PF 
evaluative ratings. Based on (11), one can clearly see that: 


V(pϕj) =

or equivalently,

and V(pφj) = 0.4824 in Case 1, V(pϕj) = 0.5000 and V(pφj) = 0.5017 in 
Case 2, and V(pϕj) = 0.4549 and V(pφj) = 0.5496 in Case 3. Recall that cj 
is a benefit criterion, i.e., cj ∈ CI. Accordingly, it is anticipated that pφj 
should have an advantage over pϕj because V(pφj)⩾V(pϕj) in Cases 1–3. 
According to (21), the squared PF Euclidean distances from p+j are 
computed as below: 


S(pϕj, p+j) =
1
3


[(
1 − 0.16002


)2
+ 0.35004 + 0.92304 + (1 − 0.2730)2


]


= 0.7396  


and S(pφj,p+j) = 0.7154 in Case 1, S(pϕj,p+j) = 0.5313 and S(pφj,p+j) =
0.5311 in Case 2, and S(pϕj,p+j) = 0.3851 and S(pφj,p+j) = 0.3629 in 
Case 3. It is obvious that pφj has a smaller squared PF Euclidean distance 
from p+j than pϕj because S(pϕj, p+j)⩾S(pφj, p+j) hold in Cases 1–3. 
Therefore, pφj is more desirable than pϕj according to the comparison 
results via squared PF Euclidean distances from p+j. 


Example 4. ((Continued from Example 3)) As mentioned previously, 
Ren et al. (2016) introduced the Euclidean distance measure in PF cir-
cumstances. By the agency of the Minkowski distance model, Chen 
(2018c) and Wan et al. (2018) conveyed the generalized PF distance 
measure on account of PF sets. Applying the definition proposed by Ren 
et al. (2016), the Euclidean distances between pϕj and p+j and between 
pφj and p+j are respectively:

because the Euclidean distance between pϕj and p+j is smaller than that 
between pφj and p+j in Cases 1–3. This paper makes use of the definitions 
instituted by Chen (2018c) and Wan et al. (2018) to ascertain the PF 
distances. Let the distance parameter be equal to five. The generalized 
PF distances between pϕj and p+j and between pφj and p+j are

and 0.9549 in Case 1, 0.8219 and 0.8227 in Case 2, and 0.6610 and 
0.6784 in Case 3. Nonetheless, such results are unacceptable because the 
generalized PF distance between pϕj and p+j is smaller than that between 
pφj and p+j in Cases 1–3. The comparison results through the agency of 
the Euclidean distance measure and the generalized PF distance measure 
violate the partial order pϕj⩽LPF pφj and the scalar-valued functions 
V(pφj)⩾V(pϕj). On account of the above discussions, the proposed 
concept of squared PF Euclidean distances can indeed produce believ-
able and desirable results, i.e., S(pϕj, p+j)⩾S(pφj, p+j) in the three cases. 


The positive- and negative-ideal PF evaluative ratings are conceived 
to be the points of reference since they serve as approachable targets (via 
positive ideals) and avoidable targets (via negative ideals) and furnish 
anchors for the ascertainment of dominance intensities. In general, PF 
evaluative ratings that have closer squared PF Euclidean distances from 
p+j are more favorable and advantageous. In contrast, PF evaluative 
ratings that have farther squared PF Euclidean distances from p− j are 
more recommendable. Consider pϕj and pφj of zϕ,zφ ∈ Z, respectively, in 
regard to cj ∈ C as an example. When pϕj⩽LPF pφj and (τϕj)


2⩾(τφj)
2, it is 


reasonable to infer that zϕ performs worse than zφ in relation to a benefit 
criterion cj ∈ CI because of the lower degree of membership (i.e., 
μϕj⩽μφj), higher degree of non-membership (i.e., νϕj⩾νφj), and higher 
degree of indeterminacy (i.e., τϕj⩾τφj). When pφj⩽LPF pϕj and (τϕj)


2⩾(τφj)2, 
it implies that zϕ performs worse than zφ in relation to a cost criterion 
cj ∈ CII because of the higher degree of membership (i.e., μϕj⩾μφj), lower 
degree of non-membership (i.e., νϕj⩽νφj), and higher degree of indeter-
minacy (i.e., τϕj⩾τφj). As indicated in Theorem 5, (T5.1) and (T5.3) 
verify the accuracy of the relation S(pϕj, p+j)⩾S(pφj, p+j) for cj ∈ CI and 
cj ∈ CII, respectively. Specifically, for cj ∈ C, higher squared PF 
Euclidean distances from p+j indicate a weaker preference, and 
conversely, lower squared PF Euclidean distances from p+j indicate a 
stronger preference. It is concluded that zϕ performs superior than zφ as 
regards to cj ∈ CI and cj ∈ CII if pφj⩽LPF pϕj and (τϕj)


2⩾(τφj)2 and if 
pϕj⩽LPF pφj and (τϕj)


2⩾(τφj)2, respectively. Moreover, (T5.2) and (T5.4) 
examine the validity of the relation S(pϕj, p− j)⩾S(pφj, p− j) in respect to 
cj ∈ CI and cj ∈ CII, respectively. Accordingly, for cj ∈ C, higher squared 
PF Euclidean distances from p− j advocate a stronger preference; 
conversely, lower squared PF Euclidean distances from p− j indicate a 
weaker preference. 


To determine the dominance relations among PF evaluations and 
conduct intracriterion contrasts and judgments, this study specifies a 
novel SED-based dominance index for appraising the span to which pij is 
far from p− j and close to p+j simultaneously. The advanced SED-based 
dominance index is capable of incarnating an overall counterpoise of 
pij between the remotest connection with p− j and the connection with 
p+j. 


Definition 6. Consider a PF evaluative rating pij (= (μij, νij; rij, dij)) in 
the characteristic Pi. The SED-based dominance index ψ of pij is 
expounded as below: 


ψ(pij) =
S(pij, p− j)


S(pij, p+j) + S(pij, p− j)

Theorem 6. The SED-based dominance index ψ(pij) of the PF evalua-
tive rating pij fulfills the succeeding properties:

(T6.1) 0⩽ψ(pij)⩽1; 
(T6.2) ψ(pij) = 0 if and only if pij = p− j; 
(T6.3) ψ(pij) = 1 if and only if pij = p+j. 


Proof. For (T6.1), the squared PF Euclidean distances S(pij, p− j) and 
S(pij, p+j) range from 0 to 1 by virtue of the property of boundedness in 
(R.1). Thus, it can prove directly that 0⩽ψ(pij)⩽1. For the necessity in 
(T6.2), the condition of ψ(pij) = 0 indicates that S(pij, p− j) = 0. In line 
with the separability property in (R.3), it is acquired that pij = p− j. 
Considering the sufficiency in (T6.2), if pij = p− j, then S(pij, p− j) = 0 in 
conformity with the property of reflexivity in (R.2). It reveals that ψ(pij)
= 0. For the necessity in (T6.3), one has S(pij, p+j)+S(pij, p− j) = S(pij, p− j)
because ψ(pij) = 1. It can be acquired that S(pij,p+j) = 0, which signifies 
that pij = p+j. Afterwards, for the sufficiency in (T6.3), if pij = p+j, then 
S(pij,p+j) = 0, which indicates that ψ(pij) = 1. This completes the proof.

the ideal PF evaluative ratings p+j and p− j can be identified as follows:

Definition 7. On grounds of the SED-based dominance index ψ, the 
dominance relations between PF evaluative ratings pϕj and pφj (for ϕ,
φ ∈ {1,2,⋯,m} and j ∈ {1,2,⋯,n}) are defined via the following SED- 
based outranking approach: 


(D7.1) pϕj≺SEDpφj if ψ(pϕj) < ψ(pφj); 
(D7.2) pϕj̃SEDpφj if ψ(pϕj) = ψ(pφj); 
(D7.3) pϕj≻SEDpφj if ψ(pϕj) > ψ(pφj).  


Example 5. ((Continued Example 3)) According to (23) in Theorem 7, 
the SED-based dominance indices are computed as follows: 


ψ(pϕj) =
1− 2(νϕj)


2
+Θϕj


1+2((τϕj)

2+0.8160


1+2(0.92302 − 0.2730+0.8160)
= 0.4145, 


where Θϕj = 0.16004 + 0.35004 + 0.92304 + 0.27302 = 0.8160, 
and ψ(pφj) = 0.4800 in Case 1, ψ(pϕj) = 0.5000 and ψ(pφj) = 0.5019 in 
Case 2, and ψ(pϕj) = 0.4151 and ψ(pφj) = 0.5698 in Case 3. From (D7.1), 
it is clear that pϕj≺SEDpφj because ψ(pϕj) < ψ(pφj) in Cases 1–3. Based on 
Definition 6, the DI index can be determined alternately using the 


squared PF Euclidean distances on the subject of the ideal PF ratings p+j 
and p− j. The squared PF Euclidean distances from p+j have been pro-
vided in Example 3. The squared PF Euclidean distances from p− j are 
calculated as below: S(pϕj,p− j) = 0.5236 and S(pφj,p− j) = 0.6603 in Case 
1, S(pϕj,p− j) = 0.5313 and S(pφj,p− j) = 0.5350 in Case 2, and S(pϕj,p− j)
= 0.2733 and S(pφj,p− j) = 0.4807 in Case 3. Observe that pφj has a larger 
squared PF Euclidean distance from p− j than pϕj because S(pϕj, p− j)⩽ 
S(pφj, p− j) hold in Cases 1–3. This reveals that pφj is more desirable than 
pϕj according to the comparison results via squared PF Euclidean dis-
tances from p− j. According to Definition 6, the SED-based dominance 
index ψ(pϕj) in Case 1 is determined as below: 


ψ(pϕj) =
S(pϕj ,p− j)


S(pϕj ,p+j)+S(pϕj ,p− j)
= 0.52360.7396+0.5236 = 0.4145, 


which is the same as that using (23) in Theorem 7. In accordance 
with the derived result pϕj≺SEDpφj in Cases 1–3, there is concordance

among the comparison results yielded by the squared PF Euclidean 
distances and by the scalar-valued functions in Example 3. The use of the 
SED-based dominance index ψ can identify and differentiate the domi-
nance intensities among PF evaluative ratings. More precisely, the dif-
ferences between ψ(pϕj) and ψ(pφj) are more significant than those 
between S(pϕj, p+j) and S(pφj, p+j) and between V(pϕj) and V(pφj) in three 
cases. Thus, the ψ index can serve a comprehensive comparison tool to 
determine intracriterion dominance extent among alternatives. 


Based on the SED-based dominance index ψ(pij), (D7.1)− (D7.3) 
provide an easy-to-use and convincing law, namely, a SED-based out-
ranking approach, for differentiating the PF evaluative ratings pij on the 
subject of a specific criterion cj. By way of the SED-based outranking 
approach, the intracriterion comparison of PF evaluative ratings and the 
determination of dominance relationships among the alternatives can be 
implemented in a manner that is uncomplicated and simple to under-
stand. Over and above that, this paper makes use of differences between 
SED-based dominance indices to ascertain the rank consistency and 
inconsistency measurements for each ordered pair of alternatives for use 
in determining goodness and poorness of fit in the PF LINMAP 
methodology. 


4. PF LINMAP methods 


This section intends to constitute a beneficial PF LINMAP method-
ology that uses the proposed SED-based dominance index and the SED- 
based outranking approach. Some useful measurements of consistency 
and inconsistency are proposed to appraise the goodness of fit and 
poorness of fit towards each ordered pair of alternatives with relevance 
to paired preference relations indicated by the decision maker. A 
straightforward and efficacious optimization model is formulated to 
resolve the optimal criterion weights and identify the best compromise 
alternative in PF decision circumstances. 


4.1. Proposed methodology 


The decision maker establishes the paired preference relations 
within a finite set of alternatives in the matter of multiple criteria. To 
match the subjective preferences of one alternative over another, a SED- 
based outranking approach using SED-based dominance indices can be 
employed in the PF LINMAP procedure. This dominance relation is 
characterized by the squared PF Euclidean distances from the largest 
and smallest Pythagorean membership grades. Additionally, such a SED- 
based outranking relation is constructed and an application is presented 
to ascertain the goodness of fit and poorness of fit from the distributive 
PF evaluative ratings over the various criteria. To make the conceptual 
process clear, Fig. 3 depicts the theoretical framework of the advanced 
PF LINMAP methodology via a SED-based outranking approach. 


The outranking relationship defined by the proposed SED-based 
outranking approach is a dominance relation to identify preference 
between two PF evaluative ratings. It is conceived that the PF evaluative 
rating pϕj outranks pφj if and only if there is adequate evidence to believe 
that pϕj is better than pφj or at least pϕj is as good as pφj. The developed 
concept of SED-based dominance indices can provide tangible evidence 
based on a solid theoretical basis. More specifically, applying Definition 
7, if ψ(pϕj)⩾ψ(pφj), it would be concluded that pϕj outranks pφj, i.e., 
pϕj≻
̃


SEDpφj. 


To further capture the dominance relation of one alternative over 
another with respect to multiple criteria, a concept of comprehensive 
dominance indices can be used. The comprehensive dominance index is 
expounded as the weighted sum of the SED-based dominance indices 
over all criteria. Let w = (w1,w2,⋯,wn) represent the weight vector 
relevant to the evaluative criteria, in which 0⩽wj⩽1 for each criterion cj 
and 


∑n
j=1wj = 1. It is noted that the exact value of wj is unknown a priori 


and should be ascertained in the PF LINMAP approach. For each alter-
native zi, the comprehensive dominance index is determined by 


multiplying the SED-based dominance index ψ(pij) by the unknown 
weight wj and then aggregating these products across the n criteria. 


Definition 8. Given the weight vector w and the characteristic Pi of 
each alternative zi ∈ Z, the comprehensive dominance index Ψ(Pi) for 
each zi is described as follows: 


Ψ(Pi) =
∑n


j=1
wj⋅ψ(pij) (24) 


where wj ∈ [0, 1] for all cj ∈ C and 
∑n


j=1wj = 1. 


Theorem 8. For each characteristic Pi in the context of the alternative 
set Z, the comprehensive dominance index Ψ(Pi) meets the succeeding 
properties: 


(T8.1) 0⩽Ψ(Pi)⩽1; 
(T8.2) Ψ(Pi) = 0 if pij = p− j for all cj ∈ C; 
(T8.3) Ψ(Pi) = 1 if pij = p+j for all cj ∈ C. 


Proof. The properties (T8.1)–(T8.3) are obviously corroborated from 
(T6.1) to (T6.3), respectively, which completes the proof. 


The core techniques of the advanced PF LINMAP methodology 
involve the comparison among the pairwise preference information and 
the comprehensive dominance relations. The preference relations be-
tween alternatives in the paired comparison information are indicated 
by the decision maker based on individual opinion or experience in the 
classical LINMAP approach. Nonetheless, incomplete and non-transitive 
judgments often occur because of various determinants such as limited 
knowledge and expertise in making the decision (Kou et al., 2016). To 
preserve most of the original information provided by the decision 
maker, this paper defines two measurements based on the perspectives 
of rank consistency and inconsistency. Consider two alternatives zϕ and 
zφ in Z. For each ordered pair (ϕ, φ) ∈ Ω, there are concordance and 
discordance if zϕ and zφ in the PF LINMAP result are ranked in the 
identical order and counter-ranked, respectively, within the two pre-
orders. If zϕ and zφ have the identical rank, ex aequo exists. As 
mentioned previously, the PF evaluative rating pϕj outranks pφj (i.e., 
pϕj≻
̃


SEDpφj) if ψ(pϕj)⩾ψ(pφj). Accordingly, it is anticipated that the 


comprehensive dominance indices Ψ(Pϕ) and Ψ(Pφ) of zϕ and zφ, 
respectively, which are connected with the optimal weight vector, 
should satisfy the inequality of Ψ(Pϕ)⩾Ψ(Pφ). Moreover, it can be 
inferred that a higher value of Ψ(Pi) indicates a stronger preference for 
the alternative zi. The proposed PF LINMAP methodology utilizes this 
rationale to ascertain the consistency measure and the inconsistency 
measure for a couple of alternatives. More precisely, no error is 
redounded to the preference relation between zϕ and zφ towards the 
ordered pair (ϕ,φ) if Ψ(Pϕ)⩾Ψ(Pφ); in contrast, if Ψ(Pϕ) < Ψ(Pφ), then 
errors exist that will be attributable to the preference relation revealed 
by the decision maker. In this regard, the following definition provides 
the measurements of rank consistency and rank inconsistency for each

Theorem 9. For each ordered pair (ϕ, φ) ∈ Ω, the consistency measure 
(Ψ(Pϕ) − Ψ(Pφ))


+ and the inconsistency measure (Ψ(Pϕ) − Ψ(Pφ))
− satisfy 


the following properties: 


(T9.1) (Ψ(Pϕ) − Ψ(Pφ))
+


= max{0,Ψ(Pϕ) − Ψ(Pφ)}; 
(T9.2) (Ψ(Pϕ) − Ψ(Pφ))


−
= max{0,Ψ(Pφ) − Ψ(Pϕ)}; 


(T9.3) (Ψ(Pϕ) − Ψ(Pφ))
+⩾0 and (Ψ(Pϕ) − Ψ(Pφ))


− ⩾0; 
(T9.4) (Ψ(Pϕ) − Ψ(Pφ))


+
− (Ψ(Pϕ) − Ψ(Pφ))


−
= Ψ(Pϕ) − Ψ(Pφ). 


Proof. Properties in (T9.1) and (T9.2) can be easily proved from the 
definitions in (25) and (26), respectively. (T9.3) is trivially true based on 
(T9.1) and (T9.2). For (T9.4), according to Definition 9, one obtains: 


(Ψ(Pϕ) − Ψ(Pφ))
+
− (Ψ(Pϕ) − Ψ(Pφ))


−


=


{
(Ψ(Pϕ) − Ψ(Pφ)) − 0 if Ψ(Pϕ)⩾Ψ(Pφ)
0 − (Ψ(Pφ) − Ψ(Pϕ)) if Ψ(Pϕ) < Ψ(Pφ)


= Ψ(Pϕ) − Ψ(Pφ).


Consequently, (T9.4) is correct, which completes the proof. 
The consistency measure (Ψ(Pϕ) − Ψ(Pφ))


+ ascertains the level of 
consistency between the ranking orders of zϕ and zφ in which the or-
dered pair (ϕ,φ) is acquired in the light of the subjective preference 
relationships in Ω, and the other ranking order is identified on the basis 
of the obtained Ψ(Pϕ) and Ψ(Pφ). Next, this paper sums the consistency 
measure (Ψ(Pϕ) − Ψ(Pφ))


+ over all (ϕ,φ) ∈ Ω; accordingly, the degree of 
goodness of fit G is quantified in the following manner: 


G =
∑


(ϕ,φ)∈Ω


(Ψ(Pϕ) − Ψ(Pφ))
+ (27)  


where G⩾0 because (Ψ(Pϕ) − Ψ(Pφ))
+⩾0 from (T9.3). 


The inconsistency measure (Ψ(Pϕ) − Ψ(Pφ))
− appraises the level of 


inconsistency towards the ranking orders of zϕ and zφ; it can describe the 
error for each ordered pair (ϕ,φ) ∈ Ω. Specifically, when Ψ(Pϕ) < Ψ(Pφ)
towards pair (ϕ,φ), the difference between Ψ(Pϕ) and Ψ(Pφ) denotes the 
error. By way of explanation, the difference Ψ(Pφ) − Ψ(Pϕ) signifies the 
degree to which the condition Ψ(Pϕ)⩾Ψ(Pφ) is violated. This paper sums 
the inconsistency measure (Ψ(Pϕ) − Ψ(Pφ))


− over all (ϕ,φ) ∈ Ω; there-
upon, the degree of poorness of fit B is measured as below: 


B =
∑


(ϕ,φ)∈Ω


(Ψ(Pϕ) − Ψ(Pφ))
− (28)  


where B⩾0 because (Ψ(Pϕ) − Ψ(Pφ))
− ⩾0 from (T9.3). 


In general, a larger B value indicates a greater degree of violation of 
the conditions associated with the preference relations revealed in the 
set Ω. To acquire the optimal weight vector for which B is minimal, this 
paper establishes an optimization model to minimize the B value in the 
proposed PF LINMAP methodology. Particularly, it is rational and un-
derstandable to postulate that the decision maker desires to receive the 
PF LINMAP solution with high goodness of fit and low poorness of fit. It 
directly follows that the condition of G⩾B should be amalgamated to the 
proposed optimization model. In what follows, let a non-negative 
number ħ denote the lowest acceptable level relating to the difference 
between G and B. Thereby, the imposed condition in which G must be 
larger than or equal to B is expressed as follows: 


G − B ≥ ħ (29) 


This paper attempts to formulate an optimization problem in order 
that paired preference judgments compared to the given ordered pairs in 
Ω are violated as minimally as possible. Specifically, to minimize the 
poorness of fit B under the consideration that the goodness of fit G is not 
smaller than B by ħ, the optimization problem Model I is established as 
below: 


Model I. min{B}

(30) 


The poorness of fit B is composed of the inconsistency measures 
(Ψ(Pϕ) − Ψ(Pφ))


− for all (ϕ,φ) ∈ Ω. It directly follows that B is identified 
by the comprehensive dominance indices Ψ(Pϕ) and Ψ(Pφ), which 
involve the unknown importance weights of the criteria. Because 
(Ψ(Pϕ) − Ψ(Pφ))


−
= max{0,Ψ(Pφ) − Ψ(Pϕ)} from (T9.2), the objective B 


in Model I can be represented as below: 


B =

(31) 


Let Γϕφ denote the degree of violation concerning the ordered pair (ϕ,
φ); it is defined as the maximum of 0 and Ψ(Pφ) − Ψ(Pϕ) for each (ϕ,
φ) ∈ Ω. Specifically, Γϕφ in relation to Ψ(Pϕ) and Ψ(Pφ) represents the 
extent contrary to the decision maker’s preference relation zϕ≻ zφ, as 
below: 


Γϕφ = max{0,Ψ(Pφ) − Ψ(Pϕ)} = max

To acquire an acceptable and convincing result that is in concor-
dance with the paired preference relations (ϕ,φ) offered by decision 
maker in the set Ω as possible, this paper formulates Model II to deter-
mine the optimal Γϕφ values for each (ϕ,φ) ∈ Ω and the optimal weight 
vector w = (w1, w2, ⋯, wn). Accordingly, one receives the optimal 
comprehensive dominance indices Ψ(Pi) for all zi ∈ Z and next acquire 
the priority orders of the alternatives in accordance with the obtained 
Ψ(Pi) values. Moreover, the paired preference relations in Ω, as ex-
pected, is violated as minimally as possible with the optimal solution. 
Nevertheless, such an optimization problem in Model II for which 
∑


(ϕ,φ)∈ΩΓϕφ is minimal might lead to a trivial solution involving wj = 1 
for a particular criterion cj and wj′ = 0 for the remaining n − 1 criteria 
(cj′ ∈ C), which indicates a specialized degenerate weighting result. To 
overcome such difficulty, this paper modifies the range of the criterion

weights by adding some non-negative boundary conditions. More pre-
cisely, one can apply the constraints that wj⩾εj for each cj ∈ C, in which 
εj is a sufficiently small non-negative number. For convenience, without 
loss of generality, assume that all εj values are the same, i.e., εj = ε0 for 
each cj. 


The comprehensive dominance index Ψ(Pi) is obtained by adding the 
weighted SED-based dominance indices (i.e., wj⋅ψ(pij)) over the n 
criteria. The alternative with the highest comprehensive dominance 
index will be the decision maker’s preferable option. To be specific, a 
larger value of Ψ(Pi) gives rise to a greater preference for the alternative 
zi. Thus, it is anticipated that the decision maker desires to ascertain a 
solution of criterion weights in such a way that the total sum of Ψ(Pi) for 
all m alternatives is maximal. In addition to the minimal B value (i.e., 
∑


(ϕ,φ)∈ΩΓϕφ), the proposed optimization model should involve another 
objective to maximize the total sum of the Ψ values, namely

coordinate the two objectives in Model III. Specifically, the values η and 
1 − η represent the weights pertaining to the “total comprehensive 
dominance index” objective and the “degree of poorness of fit” objec-
tive, respectively. Accordingly, the advanced PF LINMAP methodology

The optimal Γϕφ values for each ordered pair (ϕ,φ) ∈ Ω and the 
optimal weight vector w = (w1,w2,⋯,wn) are obtained by solving Model 
IV using the Simplex method. The corresponding comprehensive 
dominance index Ψ(Pi) for each alternative zi ∈ Z is determined as

4.2. Proposed algorithm 


Under the aegis of SED-based dominance indices, the proposed PF 
LINMAP method by way of a SED-based outranking technique for 
tackling an MCDA problem under sophisticated uncertainty of Pythag-
orean fuzziness can be concretized in the succeeding algorithmic pro-
cedure. Additionally, Fig. 4 recapitulates the implementation process of 
the developed PF LINMAP methodology, comprising of formulation of 
an MCDA problem, query from the decision maker, determination of 
SED-based dominance indices, specification of parameter values, con-
struction of a linear programming problem using Model IV, and com-
plete ranking of alternatives. 


Algorithm for the PF LINMAP methodology 


Step 1: Form the set of candidate alternatives Z (= {z1, z2,⋯, zm} ) 
and the set of evaluative criteria C (= {c1, c2,⋯, cn}) to construct an 
MCDA problem. The set C is separated into CI and CII. 
Step 2: Use Pythagorean membership grades to constitute the PF 
evaluative rating pij in (12) of an alternative zi ∈ Z in connection with 
criterion cj ∈ C, and then construct the characteristic Pi of zi using 
(13). 
Step 3: Receive the preference relations between alternatives in Z by 
conducting an investigation to the decision maker. Sculpture the set 
of ordered pairs Ω using (14), and set the η value to represent the 
importance of total comprehensive dominance relative to poorness 
of fit. 
Step 4: Derive the SED-based dominance index ψ(pij) of each pij on 
the subject of the ideal PF evaluative ratings p+j and p− j using (23). 
Step 5: Set the parameter values. Assign the ħ value that denotes the 
lowest acceptable level relating to the difference between goodness 
and poorness of fit. Specify the εj value that represents the non- 
negative boundary condition of the weight wj. Alternately, desig-
nate the ε0 value and let εj = ε0 for each cj for brevity. 
Step 6: Establish a linear programming model using Model IV in (37) 
by virtue of the degree of violation Γϕφ for each ordered pair (ϕ,φ) ∈
Ω and the weight vector w (= (w1,w2,⋯,wn)). 
Step 7: Apply the Simplex method to resolve the model to ascertain 
the optimal Γϕφ values and the optimal vector w = (w1,w2,⋯,wn) of 
criterion importance. 
Step 8: Employ (38) to compute the comprehensive dominance index 
Ψ(Pi) for each zi ∈ Z, and then rank the m alternatives in Z in the light 
of the descending order of Ψ(Pi). Identify the best compromise so-
lution z* using (39). 


5. Real-world application with comparison studies 


To corroborate the feasibility and efficaciousness of the advanced PF 
LINMAP methodology, this section attempts to investigate a down-to- 
earth application concerning the assessment of bridge-superstructure 
construction methods. Moreover, certain comparative analyses with 
other pertinent techniques, followed by a discussion under various 
parameter settings, are executed to evaluate the flexibility and ratio-
nality of the developed methodology. In the end, the proposed

problems in PF settings, along with two applications of green supplier 
selection and railway project investment. 


5.1. Model illustration and realistic applications 


This subsection intends to explore the selection issue concerning 
bridge-superstructure construction methods to illustrate the algorithmic 
procedure and demonstrate the effectuality of the current methods. This 
realistic problem was originally formulated by Chen (2012, 2014) in 
interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy contexts and was further extended by 
Chen (2018a, 2018b) in interval-valued PF contexts. Recently, Chen 
(2019a, 2019b) modified the bridge-superstructure construction case to 
adapt to the PF environments and converted the interval-valued PF data 
into Pythagorean membership grades. This subsection utilized the de-
cision information based on PF sets for examining the achievability and 
usefulness of the advanced PF LINMAP methodology. 


The practical case under study, which was adopted from Chen 
(2019a, 2019b), comprises four bridge-construction methods and eight 
evaluative criteria, as summarized in Fig. 5. As shown in this figure, the 
candidate alternatives are comprised of the advanced shoring method 


(z1), the incremental launching method (z2), the balanced cantilever 
method (z3), and the precast segmental method (z4). The criteria for 
evaluating the alternatives consist of durability (c1), damage cost (c2), 
construction cost (c3), traffic effect (c4), site condition (c5), climatic 
condition (c6), landscape (c7), and environmental impact (c8). Durability 
and site condition are benefit criteria, whereas the remaining six criteria 
are cost criteria. 


The proposed PF LINMAP methodology using a SED-based out-
ranking approach with SED-based dominance indices was utilized to 


Fig. 5. The selection problem of bridge-superstructure construction methods.

solving the selection issue concerning bridge-superstructure construc-
tion methods in PF decision situations. In Step 1, the MCDA problem was 
represented by the agency of the set of candidate alternatives, i.e., Z =
{z1,z2,z3,z4}, and the set of evaluative criteria, i.e., C = {c1,c2,⋯,c8}. 
Here, the set C is separated into CI = {c1, c5} and CII = {c2,c3,c4,c6,c7,

denoted by: Ω = {(3,4), (4,1), (1,2), (1, 3)}. That is, the decision maker 
provided the preference relations z3≻ z4, z4≻ z1, z1≻ z2, and z1≻ z3. It is 
noted that some non-transitive relations exist in the set Ω. Specifically, 
z3≻ z4 and z4≻ z1 but z1≻ z3. Moreover, the set Ω does not comprise all 
preference judgments between alternatives in Z. In conformity with the 
decision maker’s specification, the relative importance of total 
comprehensive dominance in regard to poorness of fit is designated as 
follows: η = 0.8. In Step 4, this paper derived the SED-based dominance 
index ψ(pij) of each pij in connection with p+j and p− j. The obtained ψ(pij)
values are displayed in Table 1. 


In Step 5, this paper designated some relevant parameters as below. 


First, concerning the lowest acceptable level ħ, the degree of goodness of 
fit G is not smaller than the degree of poorness of fit B by ħ=0.25, i.e., 
G − B⩾0.25. Next, consider the non-negative boundary condition εj for 
each j ∈ {1,2,⋯,8}. The boundary conditions were assigned as follows: 
ε1 = ε7 = 0.1 for c1 and c7, ε5 = ε8 = 0.075 for c5 and c8, ε2 = ε6 = 0.05 for 
c2 and c6, and ε3 = ε4 = 0.025 for c3 and c4. Accordingly, the following 
constraints were imposed into the PF LINMAP model: w1⩾0.1, w2⩾0.05, 
w3⩾0.025, w4⩾0.025, w5⩾0.075, w6⩾0.05, w7⩾0.1, and w8⩾0.075. 


In Step 6, the decision variables consist of the unknown weight wj for 
j ∈ {1,2,⋯, 8} and the degree of violation Γϕφ for each ordered pair (ϕ,
φ) ∈ Ω, i.e., Γ34, Γ41, Γ12, and Γ13 according to Ω = {(3,4),(4,1),(1,2),(1,


3)}. To apply Model IV, the consequences of ψ(pϕj) − ψ(pφj) for (ϕ,φ)∈ Ω,

computed based on the SED-based dominance indices in Table 1. The 
yielded results are demonstrated in Table 2. 


As mentioned before, the relative importance of total comprehensive 
dominance in regards to poorness of fit was designated as η=0.8. That is, 
the weight of

established as below:   


In Step 7, the linear programming model in (40) was resolved to 
receive the optimal objective value 2.4368, the optimal weight vector 
w = (w1, w2, ⋯, w8) = (0.1, 0.05, 0.1952, 0.025, 0.075, 0.05, 0.1, 
0.4048), and the optimal degrees of violation Γ34 = Γ12 = Γ13 = 0, and 
Γ41 = 0.0529. In Step 8, the comprehensive dominance indices of the 
four characteristics were obtained as below: Ψ(P1) = 0.8451, Ψ(P2) =
0.5951, Ψ(P3) = 0.8267, and Ψ(P4) = 0.7922. Thus, the priority 
ranking of the four alternatives is z1 ≻ z3 ≻ z4 ≻ z2. Correspondingly, 
the best compromise solution z* is the advanced shoring method (z1)

because Z* = {z1}. 
Furthermore, it can be observed that different solution results were 


determined under various parameter settings. Consider the lowest 
acceptable level ħ as an example. When ħ=0.00–0.21, the ranking 
consequence of the four alternatives was z3 ≻ z1 ≻ z4 ≻ z2, which yields 
Z* = {z3}. The ranking outcomes z1 ≻ z3 ≻ z4 ≻ z2 and z1 ≻ z4 ≻ z3 ≻
z2 were drawn in the cases of ħ=0.22–0.27 and ħ=0.28–0.30, respec-
tively, which renders Z* = {z1}. The ranking consequence of the alter-
natives was z3 ≻ z4 ≻ z1 ≻ z2 for ħ=0.31 and 0.32; moreover, Z* =
{z3}. It is worthwhile to notice that no feasible solutions would be found 
if a high ħ value was assigned. On this account, the designation of a 
suitable ħ value is an indispensable issue of utilizing the PF LINMAP 
methodology in practice. 


5.2. Comparative analysis with discussions 


This subsection strives to systematically scrutinize the effect of the 
PF LINMAP model in distinct parameter settings concerning the 
comprehensive dominance indices among alternatives. Furthermore, 
this subsection carries out a comparative study with pertinent MCDA 
methods to examine the effectuality and strong points of the advanced 
methodology in practice. The main framework of the comparative 
analysis is shown in Fig. 6. 


The first comparative study aims to conduct a sensitivity analysis for 
the non-negative boundary conditions of criterion weights. Specifically, 
this analysis observes the effects of distinct ε0 values towards the 
optimal comprehensive dominance indices and their ranking outcomes 
rendered by the PF LINMAP methodology. Regarding the same the 
bridge-superstructure construction case, one can assume εj = ε0 for each 
cj ∈ C in the imposed condition wj⩾εj for convenience. Ten instances of 
the ε0 values were concerned, consisting of ε0 = 0.01,0.02,⋯, and 0.10. 
Two ħ values were designated when assigning the lowest acceptable 
level towards G − B: ħ=0.0 and 0.1. Under the setting of η = 0.8 inquired 
from the decision maker, the comparison results of the comprehensive 
dominance index Ψ(Pi) for each alternative zi ∈ Z are depicted in Fig. 7. 


On the strength of the optimal comprehensive dominance index 
Ψ(Pi) for each zi ∈ Z, several priority rankings among alternatives were 
acquired when the ε0 value gradually increases from 0.01 to 0.10. For 
the comparison results revealed in Fig. 7(a) (i.e., the case of ħ=0.0), 
three ranking results were determined: z1 ≻ z3 ≻ z4 ≻ z2, 
z1 ≻ z3 ≻ z2 ≻ z4, and z3 ≻ z1 ≻ z2 ≻ z4 for ε0 = 0.01, ε0 = 0.02,0.03,
⋯, 0.06, and ε0 = 0.07, 0.08, ⋯, 0.10, respectively. The corresponding 
best compromise solution z* would be z1 and z3 (i.e., Z* = {z1} and Z* =
{z3}) for ε0 = 0.01,0.02,⋯, 0.06 and ε0 = 0.07, 0.08, ⋯, 0.10, respec-
tively. In the case of ħ=0.1, as shown in Fig. 7(b), the proposed PF 


LINMAP model rendered four ranking results of z1 ≻ z3 ≻ z4 ≻ z2, 
z1 ≻ z3 ≻ z2 ≻ z4, z3 ≻ z1 ≻ z2 ≻ z4, and z3 ≻ z1 ≻ z4 ≻ z2 for ε0 =
0.01, ε0 = 0.02, 0.03, ⋯, 0.06, ε0 = 0.07, 0.08, and ε0 = 0.09, 0.10, 
respectively. The best compromise solution z* would also be z1 and z3 for 
ε0 = 0.01,0.02,⋯,0.06 and ε0 = 0.07, 0.08,⋯, 0.10, respectively. The 
contrasts of comprehensive dominance indices among the four alterna-
tives under various ε0 values in the cases of ħ=0.0 and 0.1 are sketched 
in the two distribution charts of Fig. 8. When the ε0 value increases from 
0.01 to 0.10 under the settings of ħ=0.0 and η = 0.8 as well as ħ=0.1 and 
η = 0.8, the two alternatives z1 and z3 perform better than z2 and z4 
because the values of Ψ(P1) and Ψ(P3) are steadily larger than Ψ(P2) and 
Ψ(P4). 


The second comparative study attempts to implement a sensitivity 
analysis for the relative importance of total comprehensive dominance 
in regards to poorness of fit under various lowest acceptable levels. 
Eleven instances of the η values were concerned: η = 0.0,0.1,⋯, and 1.0. 
Moreover, this study designated six ħ values (consisting of 0.0, 0.1,⋯, 
and 0.5) and two ε0 values (consisting of 0.01 and 0.02) to investigate 
the resulting comprehensive dominance indices among the four alter-
natives under different settings more comprehensively. Note that the 
assigned ħ values are appropriate because such parameter settings 
would not lead to infeasibility of the PF LINMAP model. More specif-
ically, the following instances were considered, consisting of the com-
binations of η = 0.0, 0.1,⋯, 1.0 and ħ = 0.0,0.1,⋯, 0.5 under the 
settings ofε0 = 0.01 and 0.02. 


Fig. 9 depicts the comparison results of the obtained Ψ(Pi) values 
under various η values forε0 = 0.01. In particular, the optimal 
comprehensive dominance indices in the cases of ħ = 0.0, 0.1,⋯, and 
0.5 are contrasted in the figures (a)–(f), respectively. As a whole, the 
differentiations among the Ψ(Pi) values become much apparent when 
η > 0.6, η > 0.5, and η > 0.4 in the cases of ħ = 0.0, 0.1, ħ = 0.2, 0.3,
0.4, and ħ = 0.5, respectively. As sketched in Fig. 9(a)–(d), the most 


frequent ranking outcome was z1 ≻ z3 ≻ z4 ≻ z2 in the situations of ħ =
0.0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3. Based on Fig. 9(e), the two rankings z1 ≻ z3 ≻
z4 ≻ z2 and z1 ≻ z4 ≻ z3 ≻ z2 were rendered frequently in the case of 
ħ = 0.4. In contrast, from Fig. 9(f), the two rankings z4 ≻ z3 ≻ z1 ≻ z2 
and z1 ≻ z4 ≻ z3 ≻ z2 were determined frequently in the case of ħ = 0.5. 
The consistent set Z* = {z1} was acquired in most η values, which fol-
lows that the best compromise solution z*, namely the advanced shoring 
method (z1), is considerably steady in various settings of the η values in 
Fig. 9(a)–(e). Nonetheless, distinct results of Z* = {z4} and Z* = {z1}
were obtained according to the pattern in Fig. 9(f). That is, the precast 
segmental method (z4) and the advanced shoring method (z1) were the 
best compromise solutions in the cases of η = 0.0, 0.1,⋯, 0.5 and η =
0.6,0.7,⋯,1.0, respectively. However, the differences between the top

two Ψ(Pi) values are unnoticeable when η⩽0.6, η⩽0.5, and η⩽0.4 in the 
cases of ħ = 0.0, 0.1, ħ = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and ħ = 0.5, respectively, which 
implies that the final conclusion about the best compromise solution z* 
should be made seriously in these cases. 


In the case ofε0 = 0.02, the solution results of the optimal compre-
hensive dominance indices under various η values are demonstrated in 
Fig. 10, in which the Ψ(Pi) values for ħ = 0.0, 0.1, ⋯, and 0.5 are 
compared in the figures (a)–(f), respectively. Except for ħ = 0.5, the 
similar observations in the case ofε0 = 0.01 can roughly apply to the case 
ofε0 = 0.02. As shown in Fig. 10(a)–(e), the distinctions among the Ψ(Pi)
values become noticeable when η > 0.6 and η > 0.5 in the cases of ħ =
0.0, 0.1 and ħ = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, respectively. Nevertheless, from Fig. 10 
(f), the obtained Ψ(Pi) values for ħ = 0.5 presents unchangeable patterns 


under different settings of the η value. Concerning the patterns in Fig. 10 
(a)–(c) (i.e., ħ = 0.0, 0.1, and 0.2), the same ranking result z1 ≻ z3 ≻
z2 ≻ z4 was obtained in the cases of η = 0.7,0.8,0.9,1.0. Thus, the set 
Z* = {z1} was acquired in these cases. The settings of η = 0.1, 0.2,⋯,0.6 
rendered the consistent ranking z3 ≻ z1 ≻ z4 ≻ z2 (with Z* = {z3}) for 
ħ = 0.0 and 0.1. However, for ħ = 0.2, two distinct ranking outcomes 
z1̃z3 ≻ z4 ≻ z2 (with Z* = {z1, z3}) and z1 ≻ z3 ≻ z4 ≻ z2 (with Z* =
{z1}) were generated for η = 0.1, 0.2,⋯, 0.5 and η = 0.6, respectively. 
Consider the case of ħ = 0.3 in Fig. 10(d). Except for η = 0.0, the set-
tings of η = 0.1, 0.2,⋯, 1.0 produced the identical ranking result 
z1 ≻ z3 ≻ z4 ≻ z2, where Z* = {z1}. Based on Fig. 10(e), the two rank-
ings z4 ≻ z3 ≻ z1 ≻ z2 (with Z* = {z4}) and z1 ≻ z4 ≻ z3 ≻ z2 (with Z* =
{z1}) were finalized frequently in the case of ħ = 0.4. For ħ = 0.5 in

Fig. 10(f), the settings of η = 0.0, 0.1,⋯,1.0 yielded the same ranking 
result z4 ≻ z3 ≻ z1 ≻ z2, where Z* = {z4}. Analogous to the situation 
forε0 = 0.01, the differences between the top two Ψ(Pi) values in Fig. 10 
(a)–(e) are inapparent when η⩽0.6 and η⩽0.5 in the cases of ħ = 0.0, 0.1 
and ħ = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, respectively. 


The third comparative study concentrates on the exploration of the 
application outcomes rendered by other pertinent MCDA approaches to 
demonstrate the flexibility and strong points of the developed PF LIN-
MAP methodology using a SED-based outranking approach. As 
mentioned before, the MCDA problem concerning bridge-superstructure 
construction methods has been investigated by Chen (2012, 2014) 
within interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy environments, Chen (2018a, 
2018b) within interval-valued PF environments, and Chen (2019a, 


2019b) within PF environments. Table 3 summarizes the comparison 
results concerning the bridge-superstructure construction problem. 


The priority ranking z1 ≻ z3 ≻ z4 ≻ z2 rendered by the developed PF 
LINMAP methodology coincides with the ranking outcomes produced by 
the interval-valued PF outranking method (Chen, 2018b) and the 
PROMETHEE-based method (Chen, 2019a). Overall, all comparative 
approaches rendered similar solution results. More precisely, the alter-
natives z1 and z3 belong to the relatively superior choices, whereas z2 
and z4 belong to the relatively inferior choices in the bridge- 
superstructure construction case. Accordingly, the priority ranking 
generated by the current method achieves a consensus in view of the 
results that were rendered by use of the other comparative methods. It is 
worthy to note that the core techniques of the inclusion-based LINMAP

approach (Chen, 2014) and the proposed method are the LINMAP 
model. Thus, this comparative analysis further examines the effective-
ness and validity of the solution results generated by these two LINMAP- 
based approaches. As mentioned before, the decision maker indicated 
the preference relations z3≻ z4, z4≻ z1, z1≻ z2, and z1≻ z3; namely, the 
set of ordered pairs Ω = {(3,4), (4, 1), (1,2), (1,3)}. The rationale of the 
LINMAP model is to preclude any violation of the decision maker’s 
preference assessments as minimally as possible. That is, the LINMAP 
model should produce a consistent evaluation of all alternatives to 
minimize the degree of violation of the preference relationships in the 
set Ω. However, it is presumed that certain degrees of violation may be 
larger than zero because non-transitive relations exist in the set Ω (i.e., 
the ordered pairs (3,4), (4,1), and (1,3)) in the problem of bridge- 
superstructure construction. The developed PF LINMAP model gener-
ated the ranking z1 ≻ z3 ≻ z4 ≻ z2. Only one ordered pair (4,1) is 
violated because the obtained partial order z1 ≻ z4 is contrary to the 
preference relation z4≻ z1 revealed by the decision maker. In conformity 
with the solution results, the optimal degree of violation for (4,1) was 
Γ41 = 0.0529; moreover, the other optimal degrees of violation were 
equal to zero (i.e., Γ34 = Γ12 = Γ13 = 0). In contrast, the inclusion- 
based LINMAP approach generated the ranking result 
z3 ≻ z1 ≻ z4 ≻ z2, in which two ordered pairs (4,1) and (1,3) are 
violated because the partial orders z1 ≻ z4 and z3 ≻ z1 are contrary to 
the preference relations z4≻ z1 and z1≻ z3 based on the set Ω. Therefore, 
the proposed PF LINMAP methodology performs better than the 
inclusion-based LINMAP approach because it can render more reason-
able and desirable results. 


To compare the application results more comprehensively, this paper 
incorporates the aforementioned sensitivity analyses into the compara-
tive discussions. Table 4 summarizes the comparison results of the 
sensitivity analyses, consisting of the obtained priority rankings and the 
sets of best compromise solutions. The top part of this table displays the 
outcomes of the sensitivity analysis for the non-negative boundary 
conditions (i.e., the ε0 values) in the cases of ħ=0.0 and 0.1 under the 
condition η = 0.8. The bottom part of this table gives details of the 
outcomes of the sensitivity analysis for various weights of the total 
comprehensive dominance objective (i.e., the η values) in the cases of ε0 
= 0.01 and 0.02 under the conditions ħ = 0.0, 0.1,⋯, and 0.5. 


In accordance with the comparisons in Table 4, the alternatives z1 
and z3 are the best compromise solutions (i.e., Z*={z1} or {z3}) in most 
situations when employing the proposed PF LINMAP methodology, 
which is in conformity with the obtained results generated by the other 
comparative approaches. In particular, the nonlinear assignment-based 
method, the interval-valued PF outranking approach, and the 
PROMETHEE-based method yielded the best compromise solution z1, 
while the inclusion-based LINMAP method, the compromise approach 


with correlation-based closeness indices, and the PF compromise 
approach based on generalized distance measures produced the best 
compromise solution z3. It is worthwhile to mention that the proposed 
methodology rendered another best compromise solution z4 in some 
specific situations, including the following cases: (i) ε0 = 0.02, ħ=0.4, 
and η = 0.1–0.5; (ii) ε0 = 0.01, ħ=0.5, and η = 0.0–0.5; and (iii) ε0 =
0.02, ħ=0.5, and η = 0.0–1.0. It implies that the alternative z4 is 
peradventure more likely to be the best compromise solution in case of 
high ħ values. Except for the cases (i)–(iii), the alternatives z1 and z3 are 
generally the better choices in the case of bridge-superstructure con-
struction. However, unlike the other comparative approaches, the 
developed PF LINMAP methodology is capable of generating different 
priority rankings and the best compromise solution by way of distinct 
settings of relevant parameters. That is, the employment of the param-
eters η, ħ, and εj (or ε0) empowers the PF LINMAP model to adapt to the 
realistic particularities. 


The discussions and findings in the sensitivity and comparative an-
alyses have demonstrated the applicability and adaptability of the PF 
LINMAP methodology using a SED-based outranking approach. In the 
classical LINMAP procedure, the decision maker would indicate a set of 
preference comparisons about the alternatives as input data. Note that 
the current methodology has been proven effective in reducing the 
extent of violation of the decision maker’s pairwise preferences for 
acquiring a consistent evaluation of candidate alternatives. Under the 
less consistent preference information, the proposed methodology has 
demonstrated the ability to manage such non-transitive information; 
moreover, it could still produce a more reasonable ranking result than 
the inclusion-based LINMAP method. The PF LINMAP method does not 
inquire the decision maker to indicate all paired preference compari-
sons; thus, it is more flexible and useful than the comparative ap-
proaches. Furthermore, the obtained ranking results are more 
acceptable and valid than those rendered by the inclusion-based LIN-
MAP approach because of less extent of violation of the preference re-
lationships in the set Ω. The parameters η, ħ, and εj (or ε0) involved in the 
PF LINMAP methodology have proven effective in adapting to the par-
ticularities in practical MCDA situations. Therefore, the sensitivity an-
alyses and comparative discussions have corroborated the applicability 
and merits of the current methodology. 


5.3. Discussion on a generalization to group decision making 


There is little investigation of the advancement of LINMAP-based 
methodology for manipulating PF information over time. As stated 
earlier, the PF LINMAP approaches proposed by Wan et al. (2018) and 
Xue et al. (2018) are the most significant LINMAP-based methods in the 
last few years. The two researches opened out the classical LINMAP to

adapt to complicated uncertain environments encompassing Pythago-
rean fuzziness and then advanced group decision-making methods in PF 
settings. To make a further comparison, this subsection provides a 
practical extension of utilizing the proposed methodology in the group 
decision-making field and conducts a comparative analysis for deep-
ening more comprehensive discussions. 


Wan et al. (2018) employed the concept of information entropy to 
appraise the subjective weights of criteria for individual decision 
makers. They applied a cross-entropy optimization model to integrate 
multiple weight vectors into a collective one. Moreover, each decision 
maker’s weight was determined from the collective subjective criterion 
weight vector in an objective manner. Based on the essential structure of 
the classical LINMAP, Wan et al. (2018) defined PF group consistency 
and inconsistency indices in connection with the positive- and negative- 
ideal solutions, respectively, to unfold a bi-objective PF mathematical 
programming model. Next, a linear programming method was produc-
tively launched to resolve the bi-objective model for handling group 
decision-making issues in PF circumstances. Xue et al. (2018) defined 
the PF entropy grounded on the similarity and hesitancy concepts to 
measure the amount of knowledge associated with a PF set. They 
incorporated the PF entropy into the central procedure of LINMAP and 
developed an innovative PF LINMAP approach for multiple attribute 
group decision analysis. Their proposed model considered the maximum 
consistency and the amount of knowledge under the decision makers’ 
given preference relations between alternatives. More specifically, the 
objective function in Xue et al.’s developed linear programming model is 
to achieve the highest consistency and receive an amount of knowledge 


in connection with given preference relations. 
Notably, Wan et al. (2018) and Xue et al. (2018) exploited their 


developed approaches to manage group decision-making issues in PF 
circumstances. Nonetheless, the proposed methodology is originally 
suitable to handle single-person decision making. To solve these issues, 
this paper discusses a generalization of the advanced methodology to 
manage group decision-making issues for enhancing the efficiency and 
effectiveness of application merits. What is more, to validate the effi-
caciousness of the developed methodology as opposed to the existing 
works in the area involving multiple criteria group decision making, this 
paper compares the extended methods and techniques with the PF 
LINMAP approaches by Wan et al. (2018) and Xue et al. (2018) on the 
same application problems, i.e., green supplier selection and railway 
project investment, for facilitating a fair and impartial comparative 
analysis and validating the advantages of the developed techniques.

As mentioned earlier, Wan et al. (2018) and Xue et al. (2018) 
employed their PF LINMAP models to carry on the group decision- 
making issues concerning green supplier selection and railway project 
investment, respectively. To confirm the workableness and practica-
bility of the generalized PF LINMAP method in Model V in empirical 


group MCDA circumstances, this paper also investigates the two realistic 
problems and makes an equitable and even-handed comparative anal-
ysis. In line with Wan et al.’s and Xue et al.’s problem representations, 
the descriptions of the realistic cases of green supplier selection and 
railway project investment are displayed in Tables 5 and 6, respectively. 
There is one point worthy of particular attention in these two tables. 
Wan et al. (2018) and Xue et al. (2018) revealed the assessment data 
about the degrees of membership μkij (i.e., μ


k
cj (zi)) and non-membership 


νkij (i.e., ν
k
cj (zi)) for the evaluation of alternatives in the criteria offered 


by each decision maker. Nonetheless, the proposed extended Model V, i. 
e., the generalized PF LINMAP method using a SED-based outranking 
approach, requires the strength of commitment rkij (i.e., r


k
cj (zi)) and the 


direction of commitment dkij (i.e., d
k
cj (zi)); to be specific, the four-term 


representation is a requisite for assessment data by dint of the pro-
posed methodology. Even though the four parameters are necessary for 
implementing the developed SED-based outranking approach, there is 
no extra information demanding in comparison with Xue et al.’s and 
Wan et al.’s approaches. The main reason is that the values of rkij and d


k
ij 


can be derived by way of Definition 2. More specifically, rkij =
̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅̅


(μkij)
2
+ (νkij)

√


and dkij = (π − 2⋅θ
k
ij)/π, where θ


k
ij = arccos(μ


k
ij/r


k
ij) =


arcsin(νkij/r
k
ij). Therefore, no additional information is needed to ask 


from the decision makers. This indicates that the four-term representa-
tion does not limit practical applications of the proposed methodology. 
Moreover, the computed results of rkij and d


k
ij are contained within p


k
ij (=


(μkij,ν
k
ij; r


k
ij,d


k
ij)), as depicted in Tables 5 and 6. 


Consider the group decision-making issue of green supplier selection. 
As reported by the remark section in Table 5, it is seen that Z = {z1,z2,z3,
z4}, C = {c1, c2,⋯, c5} (with CI = {c1, c2} and CII = {c3,c4,c5}), and E =
{e1, e2, e3}. Moreover, the sets of ordered pairs for three experts (i.e., 
decision makers e1–e3) are mentioned as follows: Ω


1
={(3,2), (4,2)} for 


the expert e1 from the materials and equipment department, Ω
2
={(4,1), 


(4,2)} for the expert e2 from the quality supervision department, and 
Ω3={(2,1), (3,4)} for the expert e3 from the engineering department. On 
account of the PF evaluative rating pkij in Table 5, this paper employed

tained results are contrasted in Fig. 11. The alternatives z3 and z4 per-
forms better, roughly speaking, than z1 and z2 in conformity with the 
comparison patterns of the ψ(pkij) values. 


Relevant parameter values were set as follows: the lowest acceptable 
level ħ=0.2, the relative importance η = 0.5, and the non-negative 
boundary condition εj was replaced with the incomplete weight infor-
mation that was designated by the three experts. As indicated in Wan 


et al. (2018), the following incomplete information was imposed into the 
generalized PF LINMAP model: w2⩾2w3, 0.1⩽w5 − w1⩽0.3, 
w2 − w3⩾w5 − w1, w3⩾w4, and 0.1⩽w3⩽0.15. To apply Model V, the de-
cision variables consist of the unknown weight wj for j ∈ {1,2,⋯, 5} and

priority ranking of the four green suppliers is z4 ≻ z3 ≻ z2 ≻ z1; more-


over, the best compromise solution z* is Green supplier #4 because Z* =
{z4}. The yielded outcomes are concordant with those generated via 
Wan et al. (2018) method. 


Next, as attested by the description in Table 6, this paper exploited 
the current methodology to explore the group decision analysis problem 
about railway project investment. Referring to the remark section in this 
table, it is known that Z = {z1,z2,z3,z4}, C = {c1, c2,⋯, c6} (with CI = {
c1, c2,⋯, c6} and CII = ∅), and E = {e1, e2, e3}. The sets of ordered pairs 


for three decision makers are stated as follows: Ω1={(3,2), (4,1), (3,1)} 
for e1, Ω

={(2,1), (4,3), (2,4), (3,1)} for e2, and Ω


3
={(3,1), (3,4), (2,3), 


(2,4)} for e3. On account of the PF evaluative rating pkij in Table 6, the 
determination outcomes of the SED-based dominance index ψ(pkij) are 
contrasted in Fig. 13. For the most part, the alternatives z2 and z3 per-
forms better than z1 and z4 in the light of the comparison patterns of the 
ψ(pkij) values. 


This paper designated relevant parameter values as follows: the 
lowest acceptable level ħ=0.2, the relative importance η = 0.5, and the 
non-negative boundary condition εj = ε0 = 0.01 for each cj ∈ C. Note 
that ε0 = 0.01 is in congruence with Xue et al. (2018) setting of the 
weight constraints. By virtue of Model V, the decision variables consist 
of the unknown weight wj for j ∈ {1,2,⋯,6} and the degree of violation

strong points of the current methodology in comparison to the existing 
PF LINMAP techniques (e.g., Wan et al. (2018) and Xue et al. (2018) 
methods). First, the proposed methodology furnishes efficacious and 
flexible techniques for handling individual decision-making issues via 
Model IV and group decision-making issues via Model V. Second, the 
developed models and execution procedures are much easier to under-
stand than Wan et al.’s and Xue et al.’s approaches. On the strength of a 
uncomplicated and efficacious SED-based outranking technique, the PF 
LINMAP optimization models (i.e., Models IV and V) supply an effortless 
and unsophisticated tool to tackle (group) decision-making problems 
under complex PF uncertainty. Third, the applicability and usefulness of 
the current methodology have been thoroughly corroborated by the 
agency of three investigated issues regarding bridge-superstructure 
construction methods, green supplier selection, and railway project in-
vestment. In contrast to the existing methods and techniques, the 
employment of the proposed methodology (and its generalization) can 
yield believable and befitting outcomes and thus bring about more 
application merits in the decision-making field. 


6. Conclusions 


This paper has addressed MCDA problems with PF evaluative ratings 
and stated preference information between pairs of alternatives. By the 
agency of a newly developed Euclidean distance measure in the context 
of PF sets, this paper has delivered an efficacious concept of squared PF 
Euclidean distances and explored several beneficial and desirable 
properties, such as boundedness, reflexivity, separability, symmetry, 
and concordance of quasi-ordering. Thereafter, this paper has con-
structed the SED-based dominance index and justified its effectiveness in 
determining the dominance relations among PF evaluative ratings. To 
conduct an intracriterion comparison between alternatives, the SED- 
based outranking approach has been developed in PF decision con-
texts. Subsequently, this paper has delivered some useful measurements 
of rank consistency and inconsistency to evaluate the goodness of fit and 
the poorness of fit, respectively, from the distributive PF evaluative 
ratings over various criteria for each paired preference relation. This 
paper has formulated a series of PF LINMAP optimization problems 
under incomplete and non-transitive paired preference relations of al-
ternatives. Specifically, Model I aims to minimize the degree of poorness 
of fit under consideration of the lowest acceptable level. Model II ad-
dresses the issues of specialized degenerate weighting results and 
maximal comprehensive dominance indices and provides a linear pro-
gramming model. Model III presents a bi-objective nonlinear program-
ming model with a focus on maximizing the total comprehensive 
dominance index and minimizing the degree of poorness of fit. Model IV 
coordinates the two objectives by means of a parameter to transform 
Model III into a single-objective linear programming format. By 
resolving the simple and effective linear programming problem in Model 
IV, the optimal criterion weights and optimal degrees of violation were 
derived to receive the ultimate comprehensive dominance indices, 
generate the priority orders of competing alternatives, and conclude the 
best compromise choice. Furthermore, the selection issue of bridge- 
superstructure construction methods has been explored to corroborate 
the practicability and efficacity of the PF LINMAP methodology. Over 
and above that, the proposed methodology can be easily generalized to 
the group decision-making field. Model V exhibits the extended PF 
LINMAP model that serves a group MCDA scheme for expanding po-
tentials in practice. Finally, some comparative studies with other rele-
vant approaches, along with sensitivity analyses of various parameter 
settings, have validated the advantages and flexibility of the advanced 
methodology. 


This paper furnishes four recommendations for future research. First, 
by the agency of the concept of squared PF Euclidean distances, this 
paper suggests that future research can focus on construction of a novel 
class of Bregman divergences under uncertainty with Pythagorean fuzzy 
information. Second, this paper recommends that both the SED-based 


dominance index and the SED-based outranking approach can be 
incorporated into other MCDA models that are most often built using a 
concordance–discordance principle, such as the ELECTRE and PROM-
ETHEE methodologies. Third, a recommendation that research on the 
challenges of extending the PF LINMAP for tackling group decision 
analysis issues involving inconsistent preference information, and the 
consensus-reaching processes used to overcome those challenges can be 
made. The fourth recommendation is that an extensive range of appli-
cations of the proposed methodology can be investigated. Because the 
SED-based outranking approach with dominance indices can be conve-
niently combined with other evaluation techniques, which enables 
various applications in practical fields and industries.
