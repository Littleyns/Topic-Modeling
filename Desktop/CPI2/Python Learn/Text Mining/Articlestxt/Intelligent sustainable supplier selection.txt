Advancements in information and communication systems offer immense opportunities for supply chain in-
telligence and autonomy establishing stepping stones for Industry 4.0 supply chains (SCs). As a crucial SC de-
cision, sustainable supplier evaluation and selection process have been addressed abundantly in the previous
literature. However, this process has not yet been realized within Industry 4.0 SCs where interconnection, real-
time information transparency, technical assistance and decentralization of members of a physical system (i.e.,
supply chain members) are regarded as the main design principles. To narrow the identified gap, a Multi-Agent
Systems (MASs) approach is proposed for addressing sustainable supplier evaluation and selection process to
provide a proper communication channel, structured information exchange and visibility among suppliers and
manufacturers. Furthermore, the application of MASs in this process and their natural applicability as one of the
enabling technologies in moving towards Industry 4.0 SCs are investigated in detail. It is found that the proposed
approach can help decision-makers inside manufacturing firms to make prompt decisions with less human in-
teractions. The merit of the developed MAS is demonstrated through a real-world implementation on a medical
device manufacturer. Finally, the limitations and advantages of the proposed approach are presented together
with some remarks for future work.


1. Introduction


The application of information and communication technologies
(ICTs) started during the 1980s and is ongoing (Giannopoulos, 2004),
which has restructured every aspect of our daily life remarkably. In-
terpersonal communication is changing to human-to-machine inter-
connection at an unprecedented scale and pace in a cyber-physical
system context, and machine-to-machine direct communications
without human intervention (Botta, De Donato, Persico, & Pescapé,
2016; Posada et al., 2015). The implementation of this kind of inter-
action network within the production and operations environment is
named Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 was defined due to the growing trends
for the use of ICTs for industrial production (Oesterreich & Teuteberg,
2016). The concept of Industry 4.0 is based on three primary compo-
nents: internet of things (IoT), cyber-physical systems (CPSs), and smart
factories (Hofmann & Rüsch, 2017).


The term “IoT” firstly appeared in 1999, which was proposed by
Kevin Ashton in the context of supply chain management at Procter &
Gamble (Ashton, 2009). One of the major IoT application areas that
have been paid vast attention is IoT-enabled manufacturing. For ex-
ample, in the automotive industry, IoT is widely used in process control
and post-sale management, as well as transport (Kirk, 2015; Zhang, Qu,
Ho, & Huang, 2011; Zhong, Dai, Qu, Hu, & Huang, 2013). The term
“CPSs” firstly appeared in 2006, which was coined by Helen Gill at the
workshop sponsored by US National Science Foundation (Leitão,
Colombo, & Karnouskos, 2016). Due to the emergence of Industry 4.0
strategic initiative, a systematical deployment of CPSs in the context of
production and manufacturing received lots of attention which is also
named as cyber-physical production systems (CPPSs) in some studies
(Monostori, 2014; Otto, Vogel-Heuser, & Niggemann, 2018; Vogel-
Heuser, Diedrich, Pantförder, & Göhner, 2014). The Industry 4.0
manufacturing has many influences on the entire SC as well.

Accordingly, collaboration and cooperation among SC members are
vital to increase the information visibility in various stages of product
life cycle.


Basically, four design principles can be derived for the Industry 4.0
components, i.e., interconnection, real-time information transparency,
decentralization, technical assistance (Hermann, Pentek, & Otto, 2016).
Due to the dynamic, autonomous and distributed environments em-
bedded in SCs (Ghadimi, Toosi, & Heavey, 2018), the same principles of
Industry 4.0 which are primarily envisioned for manufacturing appli-
cations can be extended to the entire supply chain. Besides the men-
tioned enabling technologies in realizing Industry 4.0 in manufacturing
and logistics, MASs have been developed to support seamless colla-
borations for physical systems with distributed behaviors (Ben Othman,
Zgaya, Dotoli, & Hammadi, 2017; Tarimoradi, Zarandi, Zaman, &
Turksan, 2017; Utomo, Onggo, & Eldridge, 2018). Relying on the
modularity, dynamic and distributed characteristics of the MASs and
given its applications in manufacturing domain, the multi-agent tech-
nology is regarded as another enabling technology in realizing the In-
dustry 4.0 SCs. However, research and industrial applications are still
limited and at its early development stage.


Almost every decision to be made in the management of supply
chains and networks are affected by supplier evaluation and selection
activities (Ghadimi, Azadnia, Heavey, Dolgui, & Can, 2016). Besides,
sustainability triple bottom line (TBL) dimensions (environmental,
economic and social) are being integrated within the supplier man-
agement activities and there upon extended to the entire supply chain
and manufacturing operations through the whole value chain. Ac-
cordingly, many researchers strive to contribute and address the pro-
blem of sustainable supplier evaluation and selection by developing
various tools and techniques (Ghadimi et al., 2016; Zimmer, Fröhling, &
Schultmann, 2016). While great attentions have been drawn by scholars
and industry on the importance of sustainability and environmental
issues and their incorporation in SCs (Ghadimi et al., 2016; Ghadimi,
Wang, & Lim, 2019; Wang, Ghadimi, Lim, & Tseng, 2019), little prac-
tical efforts were made in incorporating sustainability issues within the
context of Industry 4.0 SCs and more specifically sustainable supplier
evaluation and selection within this context. Therefore, more research
activities are required to illuminate the research directions in this area.
Only recently, Duarte and Cruz-Machado (2017) pointed out this matter
and discussed the relationships between green and lean supply chains
and Industry 4.0 by proposing a conceptual, theoretical model with the
aim of incorporating the industry 4.0 concepts into green and lean SCs.
The developments above provide immense opportunities for the reali-
zation of digital supply chains with simultaneous consideration of
sustainability aspects, specially focusing on sustainable supplier eva-
luation and selection problem, leading to building theory and practice
towards the Industry 4.0 SCs. This domain has also been regarded as an
opportunity for research and development in the current paper.


The rest of the paper is presented as follows. The Industry 4.0 SCs
related works and the application of MASs in SCs and their natural
applicability as one the enabling technologies in moving towards
Industry 4.0 SCs are discussed more specifically in Section 2 together
with presenting the research design and contributions of this current
work. The constituents of developed MAS approach for sustainable
supplier evaluation and selection process is presented in Section 3. This
is followed by Section 4 where the implementation details of the de-
veloped MAS approach are presented together with the case study re-
sults and discussions. Finally, theoretical and managerial implications
of the conducted research are discussed in Section 5, with some remarks
concluded in Section 6.


2. Literature review and research design


Due to the introduction of digitalization and automation of pro-
cesses, the entire SC structure can be transformed into a network of
physical members which are communicating and exchanging


information with each other in real-time, intelligent and autonomous
manner aligned with the Industry 4.0 principles defined by Hermann
et al. (2016). Within this context, Schlüter and Hetterscheid (2017)
highlighted that the digitalization scenarios of various SC processes
need to be speeding up and, therefore, developed an application or-
iented framework aiming to extract relevant technologies within the
field of Industry 4.0 mapped to various SC processes. Similarly, Oks,
Fritzsche, and Möslein (2017) proposed an application map with the
aim of distinguishing various opportunity areas for applying industrial
cyber physical systems of Industry 4.0 within which integrated supply
chain, and e-procurements and logistics were identified as one of the
improvements categories. Hofmann and Rüsch (2017) investigated the
potential influences of Industry 4.0 on logistics and presented various
Industry 4.0 scenarios of the five defined Kanban characteristics.


From a technical and technological point of view, Ivanov, Dolgui,
Sokolov, Werner, and Ivanova (2016) developed a short term SC dy-
namic scheduling algorithm within the context of smart factories of
Industry 4.0. Ben-Daya, Hassini, and Bahroun (2017) performed a lit-
erature review on the impacts of IoT of Industry 4.0 on SCM and ca-
tegorized its application on various SC processes. Tu, Lim, and Yang
(2018) proposed a practical IoT-based CPS framework for production
logistics and SC applications and adopted a case study of electric sports
bicycles. Their developed framework showed competencies in moving
towards Industry 4.0 SCs. However, it was concluded that integrating
these newly developed technologies within the actual ERP and MES of
manufacturing firms still faces many important challenges.


Besides other enabling technologies of Industry 4.0 discussed in
Section 1, the applicability of agent technology and MASs as the en-
abling technologies in moving towards Industry 4.0 was discussed by
few researchers contributing in SC and manufacturing research do-
mains (Hermann et al., 2016; Leitão et al., 2016; Monostori et al., 2016;
Vogel-Heuser et al., 2014; Wang, Wan, Zhang, Li, & Zhang, 2016). This
claim can be justified by investigating more into the inherent char-
acteristics of software agents which are autonomy, social ability, re-
activity, and pro-activeness. These main features make them suitable
for modeling any type of CPSs within manufacturing and SC domains in
which local resources are autonomously managed to achieve global
objectives within a network of agents. In particular, the four mentioned
design characteristics of Industry 4.0 scenario could be mapped entirely
onto the main features of software agents and MASs sharing common
grounds.


To address the geography distributed, interactive, and dynamic
nature of the supply chain, many researchers have applied MAS tech-
nologies in the context of SCM across different industries such as e-
commerce SC (Li & Wang, 2007), agri-food SCs (Utomo et al., 2018),
petroleum gas SC (Gallab et al., 2017) and automotive SC (Avci &
Selim, 2016). Within the SC context, the MAS technology has been
applied to address problems in the supplier evaluation and selection
process. In a research activity performed by Valluri and Croson (2005),
a supplier selection problem was addressed using an agent-based game-
theoretic model concerning the existence of partial information from
both supplier and buyer members. Soroor, Tarokh, Khoshalhan, and
Sajjadi (2012) designed a supplier evaluation agent where Fuzzy Ana-
lytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and Quality Function Deployment
(QFD) were utilized for modeling the agent’s internal behavior desig-
nated to calculate and rank the suppliers in a collaborative environ-
ment. Mohebbi and Li (2012) considered the problem of supplier se-
lection in an e-SC network environment and adopted agent-based
simulation model to optimize a multi-objective linear model. Hsu, Kao,
Li, and Lai (2016) utilized agent-based technology to facilitate the
process of information sharing between suppliers and manufacturers
using a fuzzy constraint-directed negotiation model tested using a nu-
merical example of SC planning and scheduling problem. Recently, Yu,
Wong, and Li (2017) designed a MAS to integrate the products synergy
effects with a multi-product supplier selection model. Li et al. (2018)
developed a semantic-augmented MAS for the processes of supplier

selection and research connection in a distributed SC.
Besides, there are few studies that examined the effect of con-


sidering environmental and economic dimensions of sustainability into
the supplier evaluation and selection problem combined with MASs
(Ghadimi et al., 2018; Mishra, Kumar, & Chan, 2012). Hence, research
into incorporating sustainability aspects in agent-based supplier eva-
luation and selection to realize the Industry 4.0 SC environment needs
more scholarly attentions and practical demonstrations. Moreover, the
reviewed studies that addressed the process of supplier selection using
agent-based approach, considered the process as a “once-off” process
resulting in adopting a developed evaluation approach to select the
most potential suppliers from a pool of candidates (Soroor et al., 2012;
Valluri & Croson, 2005; Yu et al., 2017). Using this once-off approach,
the selection and evaluation process was often performed at the


beginning of a planning period with no further evaluations on suppliers’
performance for another period.


Building on the above reviewed works and the identified gaps, the
theoretical underpinnings of the current work distinguishes itself from
previous literature related to the Industry 4.0 SCs and sustainable
supply chain management by proposing a distributed MAS approach for
addressing the sustainable supplier evaluation and selection problem
where proper information exchange in a prompt and real-time manner
can be of great importance. The literature provides little attention on
the application of MASs for addressing Industry 4.0 SC scenario with a
focus on sustainable supplier evaluation and selection process. In this
paper, the adoption of MASs for supply chain systems that are difficult
to manage, and coordinate is addressed. An efficient fuzzy inference
system (FIS) model has been proposed and incorporated into the

developed MAS approach to model the internal behavior of the decision
maker agent integrating the three dimensions of sustainability (en-
vironmental, economic and social aspects) in the periodic supplier
evaluation process to ensure a seamless continuous evaluation of sup-
pliers’ performance toward the defined sustainable sub-themes. The
application of the developed MAS architecture has been tested through
an assumed scenario in a real-world industry setting adopted from a
medical device manufacturer in Ireland and their suppliers around the
world.


3. The proposed MAS approach for sustainable supplier
evaluation and selection problem


The sustainable supplier evaluation process considered in this study
can be described in four steps as follows. (i) Problem formulation: de-
fined the product(s) and components to be supplied; (ii) Sub-theme and
influencing factors formulation: identify the required sub-theme and
their influencing factors regarding each sustainability dimension. These
are usually defined based on manufacturer company’s requirements and
are utilized in the sustainable supplier evaluation phase. (iii)
Requirement gathering: involves the supplier firm’s participations in
collecting the required data mandated by manufacturer company for
the periodic and continuous assessment of each supplier. This in-
formation is to be exactly based on the identified IFs in step (ii). (iv)
Sustainable supplier evaluation: to quantify each supplier’s perfor-
mance capabilities toward the sustainability dimensions resulting in an
evaluation score for each using a proposed evaluation model (detailed
in Section 3.2). The multi-agent realization of this entire process is
detailed in the following.


To design a valid and reliable MAS, a literature review was per-
formed on identifying MAS development and design methodologies
(Adam, Berger, Sallez, & Trentesaux, 2011; Cossentino, Gaud, Hilaire,
Galland, & Koukam, 2010; Ghadimi et al., 2018; Leitão & Restivo, 2006;
Nikraz, Caire, & Bahri, 2006). These studied methodologies had generic
nature and incorporated object-oriented programming into their agent
design and implementation steps. In this current paper, the design
framework proposed by Nikraz et al. (2006) and Ghadimi et al. (2018)
has been adopted. The design and analysis phases of these frameworks
are based on the Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents (FIPA)
standards. FIPA compliant JADE (Java Agent Development Framework)
platform has been deployed to implement the developed MAS approach
in this paper. Sustainable supplier evaluation can be characterized as a
dyadic relationship between buyer-seller in a sustainable SC where
these two upstream members of SC should collaborate effectively to
make better sustainable sourcing decisions. The manufacturing com-
pany is regarded as the buyer of this SC sub-process, and respectively
the suppliers are distinguished as sellers. In the considered sustainable
supplier evaluation problem, there exists one buyer (manufacturing
company) who is collaborating with multiple sellers (suppliers).
Therefore, this process is considered as a one-to-many interaction. In
the proposed MAS, software agents are designed to represent various
members (buyer and suppliers) and various functional processes such as
requirement gathering and evaluation processes. The architecture of the


proposed MAS for the considered sustainable supplier evaluation pro-
blem is depicted in Fig. 1.


A three-layer system architecture is used, with the developed ar-
chitecture consisting of three types of layers, i.e., interface layer,
technical layer and data resources layer. The interface layer is about the
web/local forms that help the suppliers and manufacturer to update
their information regarding the data required for the evaluation pro-
cess. The database in data resources layer stores each supplier’s eva-
luation input data, the initial setting of the manufacturing company and
computation results regarding each supplier’s sustainable evaluation
performance score. Decision rules and ontologies can also be re-
presented in the data resource layer. The technical layer is inter-
connected with the other layers to accomplish retrieving the required
data and knowledge required to progress the sustainable supplier eva-
luation process. For more clarifications, the three designed layers are
described in the following.


Technical layer: three agents were designed to implement the
sustainable supplier evaluation process namely, Supplier Agent (SA),
Data Base Agent (DBA), Decision Maker Agent (DMA). The functions
and responsibilities of the SA, DBA and DMA agents are described in
Table 1. The behavior definition of each agent is then designed using
this responsibility table. An agents’ behavior is an actual job that it has
to do internally.


Interface layer: the interface layer is placed on the top of the other
layers in the system. The agent-user interactions can be done by an
agent in the designed MAS. The agents that have any type of interac-
tions with users should be identified in the analysis phase and should be
expressed in the agent network/diagram by an actor element. Based on
this methodology, two means of representing agent-user interactions
could be a local Java Swing-based GUI which is an abstract windowing
toolkit (AWT) or a web JSP-based (Java Server Pages) GUI. In this layer,
an agent-user graphical interface is developed for the SA using Java
Swing. This interface is accessed by a human user in any of the sup-
plier’s company to input the needed information related to the defined
sets of influencing factors related to each sustainability dimension sub-
theme.


Data resources layer: The data resources layer is composed of the
supplier knowledge base, supplier database, manufacturer database and
results database. Manufacturer database is designed to store the spe-
cifications and requirement of products and components provided by
each supplier for each planning period. Supplier database is associated
with storing the periodic evaluation information sent by each supplier
with regards to the defined evaluation sub-themes and their influencing
factors. Results database stores the calculated results from periodic
implementations of the MAS, and finally, supplier knowledge base deals
with the supplier evaluation decision rules provided by the manu-
facturer to be used in the evaluation model.


The MAS realization of the developed architecture for the sustain-
able supplier evaluation process is done using the JADE platform. The
programming environment in JADE platform consists of one more
container that can be located on various hosts, often in geographically
dispersed firms, leading into establishing distributed networks of phy-
sical firms each represented as one or sets of agents. Upon launching the

main-container, the JADE platform instantiates the Agent Management
System (AMS) agent responsible for supervising the entire platform and
also the Directory Facilitator (DF) agent who initiates the yellow pages
service offered to other active agents to either access available services
registered by other agents or catalogue their own services. Using the
distributed capabilities of the JADE platform, the designed MAS ap-
proach for the sustainable supplier evaluation problem also consists of
the main container and other containers distributed in various hosts
over the SC network. Ideally, the main container can be hosted by a
manufacturing company, and supplier firms would maintain their own
containers connected to the manufacturer’s main-container. As illu-
strated in Fig. 2, the instances of the DMA and DBA containers are lo-
cated in the manufacturing company nested in the same host where
AMS and DF are instantiated but generally in a different container
(container 1). The possession of the SA instances is handled by sup-
pliers’ organizations each located in different host and container.
Agents of the proposed system realize the sustainable supplier evalua-
tion process through message passing. In this research activity, all of the
designed agents are embedded in the main container and communicate
with each other through the local host established by JADE.


3.1. Agent interaction specifications


The communication and external relationship activities happening
among the registered agents are done through some form of specifica-
tions and interaction protocols (IPs). Each message content will be
encoded and decoded by sender and receiver, respectively. FIPA Agent
Communication Language (ACL) specifications, content language re-
presentations, and message exchange interaction protocols are utilized


to deal with message exchange activities. FIPA Semantic Language (SL),
a human readable content language, can be deployed in handling the
MAS interactions. In this stage of designing the MAS, an interaction
table is produced by mapping each agent’s defined responsibilities in
Table 1. Each row of Table 1 presents various interactions. The inter-
action tables related to the SA, DBA, and DMA are presented in Table 2.


After defining the agents’ interaction tables, requirement gathering
scheme and sustainable supplier evaluation interaction scheme are
designed. These schemes enable the agent interaction processes. FIPA
interaction protocols can be utilized to implement the developed
schemes on the JADE platform. Owing to space limitation of this article,
the sustainable supplier evaluation interaction scheme is presented
briefly in Fig. 3. FIPA Request and Inform IPs can be used to implement
this interaction scheme.


Moreover, the concrete states and semantics of the DMA are dis-
played in Fig. 4. The external relationships of the DMAs are governed
based on this state transition diagram.


3.2. Sustainable supplier evaluation model for the DMA


This sub-section details the developed sustainable supplier evalua-
tion model that governs the internal behavior of the DMA. Each sup-
plier’s performance is evaluated according to the evaluation sub-themes
and influencing factors (IFs) using a designed FIS model. The FIS model
measures the magnitude of IFs and provides a numerical score for each
of the sustainability sub-theme leading to an enhanced evaluation
process. Moreover, the developed FIS model has the capability to deal
with qualitative data where providing a quantitative value for the Ifs
would be cumbersome and difficult. These types of qualitative data are

often expressed as opinions based on expert’s knowledge which can be
converted to linguistic expressions using the FIS model. Accordingly,
Mamdani’s compositional rule of inference (Mamdani, 1974) is used to
design a FIS model that can address uncertainty and lack of magnitude
involved with IFs. This contains four stages in the fuzzy evaluation of
the input data.


• Fuzzification: Here, the input data being periodically provided by
the SAj are transformed into different grades of membership. A
target range, being the maximum or minimum values possible, is set
for each of these input variables. These scales range differently for
each of the sustainability sub-theme, with each membership func-
tion falling within these scales. It is notable that a definitive input
variable target ranges are not pre-defined in this proposed FIS and
can be defined based on several factors such as decision maker’s
expert opinions, case country’s regulations and region’s environ-
mental standards. In this research work, a triangular membership
function is incorporated in the proposed FIS model for the input
variables. Each input variable will be associated to three types of
membership functions based on the defined target ranges namely,
low, medium and high.
• Fuzzy rule base: Once the membership functions are created, the
rule base governing them is developed. The number of rules can be
calculated based upon the Equation (1).


R nv= (1)
where,


R – Number of potential rules.
n – Number of grades of membership function for input variable.
v – Number of input variables for each sub element.
The knowledge base will be comprised of a series of IF_THEN rules.


The influencing factors are combined using IF statements, resulting in a
THEN value for the related sub-theme within each sustainability di-
mension.


• Fuzzy evaluation mechanism: this step is consisted of implication
and aggregation stages of fuzzy inference process. The fuzzy con-
clusion for each rule is defined by the implication process. Various
fuzzy operator such as AND, OR and NOT would be utilized as a
logical connector to obtain the output of the implication process.
Afterwards, these output fuzzy conclusions of each rule are com-
bined into a single fuzzy set as part of the aggregation process. The
implication process output functions are used as inputs to the ag-
gregation process. The fuzzified result of each rule will be used as
the input to this mechanism. The output of this mechanism is used
for the defuzzification process.
• Defuzzification: Using a 0–1 target range, the output membership
functions are created, and are low [0 0 0.25], low to medium [0 0.25
0.5], medium [0.25 0.5 0.75], medium to high [0.5 0.75 1] or high
[0.75 1 1]. A value of 0 is categorized as low sustainability perfor-
mance and 1 is categorized as high sustainability performance. The
output membership function is the aggregation of the fuzzy in-
ference mechanism results transformed into a crisp output of the
supplier evaluation score for each sustainability dimension.


Fig. 5 illustrates the details of the FIS model utilized by the DMA as
its internal behavior mechanism which results in the sustainability
performance score (spi) of each evaluated supplier. Eqs. (2)–(4) calcu-
late the score of each sustainability dimension for each of the con-
sidered suppliers. Finally, the calculation of supplier sustainability
performance score which is the aggregate value of the three sustain-
ability dimensions weighted scores is performed using Eq. (5).

where


• spi – the sustainability performance score of ith supplier• wQi – the importance weight of economic sustainability dimension• wEi – the importance weight of environmental sustainability di-

• w i – the importance weight of social sustainability dimension.
Based on the opinion of decision-makers in the manufacturing


company, the importance weights can be defined. In some occasions,
equal weighting would be defined for all stages of the evaluation that
incurs no priority on the sub-theme and sustainability dimensions.


4. Implementation details and results


In this section, a scenario was assumed from a case study in the
electronics sector of a medical device manufacturing network to prove
the suitability of the developed MAS (Ghadimi and Heavey, 2014). The
scenario for this implementation is presented briefly in the following
description. In this supply network, a manufacturer is contracted to
procure electronic medical devices to an Original Equipment Manu-
facturer (OEM) who handles the end-customer weekly demands. Nine
suppliers are involved in supplying nine different assembly


components. Suppliers are in sites in Germany, Taiwan, and the United
States. US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates the medical
devices market where all companies involved in manufacturing medical
devices products need to be complied with ISO13485 including both the
OEM and the contract manufacturers. This restricts the contract man-
ufacturer to select its suppliers from preapproved list of suppliers of
various required components. This means that the contract manu-
facturer cannot select any component vendor outside of this list.
Therefore, the contract manufacturer will need to improve the perfor-
mance of the selected suppliers on a continuous manner.


In this paragraph, the description of the assumed scenario for the
implementation of the proposed MAS approach is presented. This sce-
nario is based on the presented supply chain network in the previous
paragraph. The contract manufacturer establishes a partnership re-
lationship with its suppliers requiring prompt information exchange
and accuracy to satisfy the weekly demands. On the other hand, the
contract manufacturer forces its vendors to regularly enhance their
production activities to produce more sustainable products. Therefore,
the suppliers require to provide the evaluation data based on a pre-
viously defined weekly basis structure for a planning period of
24 weeks. For illustration purposes, the number of suppliers for pro-
curing components required for assembling the end-product for the
OEM are assumed to be three suppliers (Supplier 1, Supplier 2, and
Supplier 3) instead of originally nine suppliers in the original case.


4.1. Requirement gathering

sustainability dimensions adopted in this work are related to the
medical device manufacturing industry. For instance, environmental
sustainability contains three sub-themes namely, green image, pollution
control and green competencies. Each of these sub-themes consists of
their own IFs. For example, market reputation and customer reputation
are IFs related to the green image. Economic sustainability consists of
four sub-themes namely, quality, delivery/service, cost and technical
capability together with their respective IFs. Finally, health and safety,
and employment practices are social sustainability related sub-themes.
Owing to the limitation of space, the complete data set (24 planning
period) of the information used by the DMA for obtaining the spi
(sustainability performance of each supplier) values are not presented
in this paper. For providing more detailed information, the type of
procured data from the associated suppliers and the considered sub-
themes and IFs related to each sustainability dimensions are briefly
presented in the following.


– Environmental sustainability input data


The input data regarding each of the influencing factors related to
the three selected sub-themes (green image, pollution control, and
green competencies) of environmental sustainability dimension has
been gathered. Table 3 tabulates the environmental sustainability di-
mension input data for the three potential suppliers that were con-
sidered for implementing the MAS approach. As can be seen, most of
the input data are provided in a qualitative manner which gives the
DMs more flexibility regarding providing input data. Table 4 provides a
ranking order of market reputation level, customer reputation level, the
level of using hazard materials in manufacturing the requested com-
ponent, percentages of solid waste in manufacturing 1 KG of the pro-
duct, level of using recyclable materials in the packaging process and
level of capabilities of the supplier companies in committing to green
processing. The provided ranking orders in Table 4 were used as input
for the fuzzy process and accordingly the developed GUI for each SA
instance regarding environmental, economic, and social sustainability
dimensions.


– Economic sustainability input data


The input data regarding each of the influencing factors related to
the four selected sub-themes of economic sustainability dimension has
been gathered. Table 3 tabulates the input data for the three potential
suppliers that were considered for implementing the MAS approach.
Table 4 provides a ranking order of various influencing factors involved
in the economic sustainability dimension.


– Social sustainability input data


Table 3 tabulates the input data for the three potential suppliers that
were considered for sustainable evaluation. Table 4 provides a ranking
order of various influencing factors involved in the social sustainability
dimension. Disciplinary and security practices can be measured as the
percentages of total numbers of oral warning, written warning, sus-
pension without pay, transfer to another task, demotion, dismissal over
all of the procedures concerning aspects of human rights that are re-
levant to the organization’s operations. Employee training can be
measured as the average number of hours that would be spent by the
employer to train each employee regarding their awareness of social
and cultural sustainability practices.


For verification purposes, the agents’ interactions with each other
with regards to suppliers 1 and 2 is illustrated in Fig. 6. FIPA Inform and
Request interactions protocols are utilized in these interactions. In this
implementation, two types of FIPA communicative acts are involved:


• Request: The S1, S2, and S3 send to the DBA to request for storing
the input data for sustainable supplier evaluation in the database.


This information was gathered using the developed GUI as a means
for the user to interact with the supplier agents.
• Inform: The DBA sends the reply to each of the supplier agents (S1,
S2, and S3) to inform them that the sustainable supplier evaluation
input data are saved in the database.


4.2. Results analysis and discussion


Table 5 presents the sustainable evaluation results for the three
suppliers related to 24 evaluation periods. The requirement gathering,
and sustainable supplier evaluation models embedded as the internal
behaviors of the SAs (supplier agent) and the DMA (decision maker
agent) are utilized in obtaining the sustainable performance scores of
the supplier 1, supplier 2 and supplier 3 at the beginning of each eva-
luation week.


As mentioned earlier, stockholders and European laws and legisla-
tions force the contract manufacturer to manufacture more sustainable
products. Otherwise, the OEM could incur complications in marketing
these medical devices to end-customers that are mostly from health
sector. The contract manufacturer can consider this matter by forcing
its supplier to enahce their operations towards producing more sus-
tainable products. For illustration purposes, it was assumed that the
supplier 2 did improve its production operations resulting a decrease in
the purchasing price of its procured component from currently 18
dollars to 13 dollars (13th evaluation week onwards). Because of this
improvement, a positive effect was experienced on the economic sus-
tainability score of the supplier 2 improving it from 0.437 to 0.5 for the
second half of the evaluation periods. Therefore, the supplier 2 sus-
tainability performance score was improved from 0.592 to 0.613. Using
the developed MAS tool, the entire supplier evaluation process was
implemented over the internet and resulted in managing the coopera-
tion of the geographically disperse suppliers and manufacturers in an
automated and digitized manner. The right information was provided
to the right supply chain member at its right time and format.


This case application was designed and conducted to prove that the
developed MAS tool can contribute towards realizing Industry 4.0 SCs
with specific reference to sustainable supplier selection problem. The
developed MAS approach has several advantages when compared with
previous implementation frameworks in Industry 4.0 SC settings. These
advantages are described and mapped into the four design principles for
the Industry 4.0 components.


• Interconnection: using MAS technology, upstream supply chain
members i.e. suppliers and manufacturer are connected over the
internet and via the designed agents. This forms the basis for in-
teractions and collaboration in a jointly manner. Various suppliers
and other supply chain members can be added/removed from the
network using a designated agent in a modular manner. This enables
the presented Industry 4.0 SC to adapt to the dynamic nature of the
markets and business environment.
• Real-time information transparency: various agents in the supply
chain will send and receive information on real-time and via using
pre-defined information exchange protocols. A well-defined mes-
sage passing structure for exchanging various information among
the involved agents adds to the information transparency principle
of Industry 4.0.
• Decentralization: the JADE platform and its distributed nature, the
capability of agents to communicate with each other on a web
server, autonomous decision-making capability of each agent to
achieve a local goal supports the decentralization feature of Industry
4.0 SCs. The decentralized, interconnected and real-time decision-
making capabilities ultimately contributes to increase the overall SC
productivity.
• Technical assistance: one of the objectives of this research study was
to illustrate the applicability of MAS in automating the process of
sustainable supplier evaluation for the involved Industry 4.0 SC

approach has considered the ambiguity of existing selected influ-
encing factors. The final supplier score provides a numerical mag-
nitude of how well/bad the suppliers are performing towards sus-
tainability TBL. This can be utilized in the order management
decision making activities resulting in ordering higher quantities to
the more sustainable suppliers on a weekly basis.


Finally, it is possible that larger instances of suppliers can be han-
dled by the developed MAS tool. An agent can be registered to the
networks of agents on JADE as the realization of a new supplier. The
new supplier agent will then start to send and received messages with
the DMA and DBA agents to perform its internal behavior. The devel-
oped interaction schemes would be utilized by each new supplier agent
and the DMA to perform the periodic process of sustainable supplier
evaluation. The new supplier data and evaluation results will then be
saved by the DBA.


5. Theoretical implications and managerial insights


This research article contributes to the Industry 4.0 SCs and sus-
tainable supply chain management literature by adopting the four de-
sign principles of Industry 4.0 originally developed in manufacturing
(Hermann et al., 2016) and considering the same principles on an SC
scenario using a MAS approach. The theoretical underpinning of the
current work aims to justify the use of agent technology as one of the
enabling technologies in moving towards Industry 4.0 SCs. Towards this
end, the sustainable supplier evaluation and selection problem were
addressed using a proposed MAS approach to automate and enhance
this process providing information exchange accuracy and facilitated
communications channels between these two members of a typical SC.
In the literature of Industry 4.0 and manufacturing applications, the use
of technologies such as IoT and radio-frequency identification (RFID)
approaches in manufacturing and production are currently widely dis-
cussed topics, which aims to connect physical and cyber world wherein
the machines, systems and products virtually and independently ex-
change and respond to information for managing end-to-end processes
(Babiceanu & Seker, 2016; Monostori et al., 2016; Tu et al., 2018).
However, the complexity of supply chain management, in general, is
one of the major bottlenecks of the field (Ivanov et al., 2016). Under-
standing such complexity and processing appropriate information to
corresponding supply chain partners play a critical factor to operate a
smart supply chain. Decentralization, information readiness, and
prompt information exchange channels, as some of the important
principle of Industry 4.0, can be regarded as key criteria to enhance
supply chain performance.


Building on these principles, the inherent characteristics of the
software agents and the relevance of MASs as a proper means for
managing information systems associated with SC members as a de-
centralized network of physical entities provides immense opportu-
nities on extending the implications of Industry 4.0 and agent tech-
nology towards achieving a digital SC. The introduction of multi-agent
technology, the utilization of its distributed, autonomous, mobile, in-
telligence and self-learning capabilities leads to the digitalization of SC
processes such as sustainable supplier evaluation and selection process
(Ghadimi et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018). In the current research activity, it
is demonstrated that the developed MAS approach has the potential to
provide interoperable and decentralized network system resulting in
prompt information exchange between suppliers and manufacturer
with considering the supplier evaluation process with regards to sus-
tainability aspects. From a theoretical point of view, the developed MAS
tool justifies the applicability of MAS technology in addressing the
design principles of Industry 4.0 SCs focusing specially on supporting
the sustainable supplier evaluation process.


From the managerial point of view, the findings obtained from the
experimental and implementation results of the MAS-based Industry 4.0
SC prototype has demonstrated that the proposed approach can be


applied on real world supply chain settings where various suppliers are
geographically dispersed. Accordingly, the work in this article provides
insights into the implementation steps of a continuous supplier eva-
luation mechanism serving as a proper tool for SC managers and in-
dustrial practitioners in a SC, specially the upstream members, to ex-
change appropriate information in an interoperable and decentralized
manner within their supply network aligned with Industry 4.0 design
principles. As final managerial remark, the merits of Industry 4.0 en-
abling technologies, such as the one discussed in this paper, in enhan-
cing industrial management are being currently addressed by scholars
and industrial practitioners. However, the ethical and legal aspects of
the new working environments that these technologies create in terms
of reduced human interactions within a digitalized SC and manu-
facturing settings must yet be addressed comprehensively.


6. Conclusions and future works


The application of multi agent technology as one of the enabling
technologies for Industry 4.0 SCs with specific consideration of supplier
evaluation and selection problem has been reported in this paper. The
inherent characteristics of the software agents such as distribution,
autonomy, mobility, intelligence, and self-learning have been utilized
to address the issues of information readiness and poor communications
channels between manufacturers and suppliers along the process of
continuous and periodic supplier evaluation. An efficient FIS model has
been developed and utilized as the internal behavior of the decision
maker agent who holds the responsibility on evaluating the geo-
graphically dispersed suppliers in a periodic manner (weekly in the case
application) resulting in reduced human interaction and time utiliza-
tion along the entire process. The inherent subjectivity and uncertainty
involved in sustainability evaluation information can be regarded as a
justification of developing such evaluation method based on fuzzy-set
theory. As a result of such implementation, the suppliers need to con-
tinuously advance their operations toward sustainability principles re-
quested by the manufacturer to ensure their competitive advantage.


As future work, the capability of the proposed MAS architecture in
being adaptable to other technologies already existing in a manu-
facturer’s or supplier’s company such as Enterprise Resource Planning
(ERP) systems and Manufacturing Execution System (MES) can also be
investigated aiming at incorporating dynamic system conditions in real-
time which is a fundamental principle in moving towards Industry 4.0.
Although the proposed tool reduces the human interaction along the
process, the requirement gathering phase of the framework is still being
done manually. Accordingly, the integration capability of agent tech-
nology with other technologies within industry 4.0 domain such as IoT
and more specially RFID to automate and enhance the requirement
gathering phase of the developed framework along the entire supply
network is regarded as another future work on this Industry 4.0 SCs
domain. With the recent dominance of sustainability considerations,
most of the SC processes are transformed into sustainable processes. As
future work, more academic research is required to draw scholarly and
industrial practitioners’ attentions on the incorporation of sustainability
in Industry 4.0 SCs and manufacturing. Research activities are required
to highlight the challenges and opportunities that the fourth industrial
revolution (Industry 4.0) can cause and provide for sustainable con-
sumption and production activities within manufacturing firms and
along their entire SCs.
