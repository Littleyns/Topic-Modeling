Keywords: Digital transformation; SMEs; E-commerce;enterprise 4.0.; big data; cloud computing; 3D printing. 


1. The Process of Digital Transformation  


Digital transformation is “a change in all job and income creation strategies, application of a flexible 
management model standing against competition, quickly meeting changing demands, a process of 
reinventing a business to digitise operations and formulate extended supply chain relationships; 
functional use of internet in design, manufacturing, marketing, selling, presenting and is data-based 
management model”[1]. Digital transformation should not be supposed as technological leap. The 
management of operations should not just focused on software-hardware updates. It is an adaptation 
of its institutional and operational ecosystems of any entity in terms of new business and thinking 
methods in an attempt to keep a pace with digitization by benefitting from digital factors. When digital 
transformation is mentioned, digitization should not only come to mind. It should be application of a 
flexible business model. Some successful digitization transformation examples can be; solar panels 
are substituted for tiles used as raw material, electric cars are started to manufacture instead of 
gasoline-powered vehicles, recycled glass are being used in manufacturing of new glass containers. 
It is significant that operations can comply with the changed competition rules and demands.  
 
According to McKinsey, digital transformation is rearrangement of technology, business models and 
processes as to ensure new values for customers and employees in constantly changing and 
developing digital economy. The speed of digital transformation is actually determined in terms of 
consumers’ demands.The period starting from product design to manufacturingis reduced, market 
entry period is shortened, product range fastly fulfilling consumers’ demands becomes possible with 
optimal and faster decision processes based on numeric data in each step of manufacturing. This 
process provides productivity growth for operations and lower their costs. Classic business models 
have been disappearing and substituted for business models which are flexible, changeable instantly, 
having real-time responses to consumers’ habits and are knowledge-based. When the changes in 
business world as a result of Industry 4.0 are reviewed, it is drawn attention that manufacturing and 
manufacturing process become practical, supply chain is better, cost of energy and infrastructure 
decreases, less human resource is required, qualified manpower increases, income and profit level is 
risen [2]. Today, the ones, who are able to be afloat in rapidly increasing digital era, are people and 
operations keeping up with that technology era. 
 
The more significant use of the pillars of digital transformation has been driven by innovation 
accelerators, which include, among other solutions, IoT, robotics, 3D printing, artificial intelligence, 
augmented and virtual reality, new generation, security, simulation, horizontal/lateral software 
integration, internet of things, cyber security, blockchain, nanotechnology, cloud computing, big data 
[3].  


1.1. Driving Factors Expediting Digital Transformation 


1.1.1. Advancement of technology and innovation, sensor technology (ST): Innovation is essential in 
economical growth, makes technology cheaper. Achievements in technology and innovation politics 
enhance economy of countries. Entrepreneurs who code and work in digital platforms should increase. 
Digital technologies allow SMEs to improve market intelligence and access global markets and 
knowledge networks at relatively low cost. 


1.1.2. Change of business practices with internet economy, electronic commerce, social media: The 
Internet provides a platform for millions of daily online transactions and communications that make 
a significant contribution to individual economies. According to WTO (World Trade Organization), 










664 Dilber Ulas  / Procedia Computer Science 158 (2019) 662–671
 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000–000 3 


E-commerce is defined as “manufacturing, distribution sale and delivery of goods and services by 
telecommunication means. According to The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD), “it s all forms of transaction relating to commercial activities including both 
organisation and individuals that are based upon the processing and transmission of digitized data 
including text, sound, and visual images”. The digital transformation facilitates the emergence of 
“born global” small businesses and provides new opportunities for SMEs to enhance their 
competitiveness in local and global markets, through product or service innovation and improved 
production processes. 


1.1.3. Globalization: As a result of advanced mobility of goods, services and capital, It is being 
mutually dependent and increase of communication and interaction between societies and 
governments existing different parts of the world in the process of cross-border reciprocal economic 
integration and national economy’s involving in world market  [4]. 


1.1.4. Industry 4.0: Information technologies and industry are gathered. In fourth industrial 
revolution, it is foreseen that manufacturing process is digitized, machines are directly connected to 
each other and personalized manufacturing is possible, besides that, environment is less polluted as a 
result of productivity growth, avoiding of excessive use of energy and water sources. As 
manufacturing becomes flexible with digital factories, manufacturing meeting less and personal 
product demand becomes possible. A considerable amount of energy saving is also provided. 


1.1.5. Artificial Intelligence: Artificial intelligence investigates how a human brain thinks and how 
people learn and decide as they try to solve a problem, and it imitates the results of this study with 
smart software. Artificial intelligence does not act upon programmer’s mind, it learns, understands 
and judges itself [5]. Manufacturing is occured by robots having artificial intelligence without human 
intervention. Intelligent software systems that can perform tasks and are in continual learning and 
improvement. 


1.1.6. Internet of Things (IoT): Internet of things is a technology based on data transfer between 
devices over internet. It consists of interconnected devices from simple sensors to smartphones and 
wearable devices. It is possible to help a person having a specific duty or to gather an information, to 
analyze, or to create an activity as to learn a process by combining those devices with automatic 
systems. Internet of things offers more operativeness relating works, time and money saving and 
mostly emission saving. IoT   refers to the everyday objects that feature an IP address for internet 
connectivity allowing them to send and receive data, and so communication occurs between these 
objects and other network devices and systems (Real-time data collection, monitoring, decision 
making, and process optimization). 


1.1.7. As new consumers, Generation Z’s expectations affecting market: They were born in years 
between 1996 and 2001 and form 25 % of the world population. It is determined that this 
generation who was born into a world of digital devices, likes mobile devices. Generation Z likes 
to act as an individual, prefers an online communication rather than verbal communication, 
subscribes into channels creating entertainment videos, follows trends from vlogs, cares viral 
marketing, desires to play an active role in the design process of products [6]. 


1.1.8. Blockchain: Blockchain is defined as decentralized ciphering record book. Blockchain, 
supporting Bitcoin (it is currency supported by everyone and cannot be controlled by anyone since 
2012 until today is a distributed database technology providing encrypted process follow-up [7]. 
 
1.1.9. Cloud Computing: It is a general term of internet based information services providing

supporting Bitcoin (it is currency supported by everyone and cannot be controlled by anyone since 
2012 until today is a distributed database technology providing encrypted process follow-up [7]. 
 
1.1.9. Cloud Computing: It is a general term of internet based information services providing 


4 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000–000 


computer sources which are used or shared between users on request for computers and other devices. 
Applications, such as Itunes, Microsoft Office ensures that software can be distributed from web 
browser instead of dowloading in computer. Meaning of Cloud computing is archiving of music and 
film files, photographs, documents. Music files, photographs, documents can be personally stored in 
the computers of users instead of data centers. Computer files can be accessed from anywhere and 
internet from every computer. 


1.1.10. Increase in the use of Smartphones: Approximately 1 billion phone is sold every year in 
worldwide.  New generation smartphones offer computer skills. ¼ of the mobile phones in worldwide 
is smartphone. In Turkey, mobile phone use is 98 %, smartphone use is 77%, computer use is  48 % 
in 2018. Total number of mobile phone users is 59 million that makes 73 % of the population. 


1.1.11. 3D Printers: It is a device quickly producing models which are designed in computer or 
prepared in 3D by using various materials without any mould or fixture. The cost of product design 
and manufacturing is lowered. It makes manufacturing faster. With 3D printers, 10 houses a day can 
be established in China. It can be used in product design, lowering mould cost, medical applications, 
prothesis, plastic plasters, personalised gifts, model making and robot design. 3DP, also known as 
additive manufacturing, refers to various processes used to synthesize a three-dimensional object. 


1.1.12. Chatbots: They are software applications which are designated with the intent of backing up 
users in service sectors and imitate written or verbal human speaking. Artificial intelligences such as 
Siri, Alexa, or Google assistant is each advanced chatbot example. 
 


1.1.13. Big Data: It means big data which computer is unable to process. BD is an evolving term that 
is used to describe any large amount of structured, semi-structured or unstructured data that has a 
potential to be mined for information. Big data help designers to derive decisive customer needs from 
the existing data to improve and develop designs [8]. Big Data and data analytics provide a wide range 
of opportunities  for SMEs, enabling a better understanding of the processes within the firm, the needs 
of their clients and partners, and the overall business environment. 
 


1.1.14. Augmented Reality: Augmented reality (AR) is described as the extension of physical reality 
by adding layers of computer generated information to the real environment. Information in this 
context could be any kind of virtual object or content, including text, graphics, video, sound, haptic 
feedback, Global Positioning Systems (GPS) data, and even smell. It ensures an increase in 
productivity and a decrease in cost by using of it in manufacturing processes. AR is used to enhance 
the natural environments or situations and offer perceptually enriched experiences. With the help of 
advanced AR technologies (e.g., adding computer vision and object recognition) the information 
about the surrounding real world of the user becomes interactive. Information about the environment 
and its objects is overlaid on the real world. Augmented reality technology, can be applied to the real 
estate market to conduct visits to fully digital properties, whereas in the medical field, the same 
resource can be applied to offer virtual training of surgeries and study of organisms.  
 
1.1.15. Developing of sharing economy: The sharing economy, the collaborative economy, the digital 
economy, the circular economy, the peer-to-peer economy are just some examples of the names 
regularly used in the economic literature and in the media. The sharing economy matches demand to 
the supply of under-used assets or skills via intermediaries, with the aid of digital technologies, and 
does so with speed and efficiency. It also enables consumers to become producers. Sharing economy 
is offering a something that we do not use for someone’s need with/out any expectation. 
 
1.1.16. Nanotechnology (N): “Nano”, as a word, means one-billionth of physical unit. There is no 
consensus on the definition of nano. Nanometre is a unit of measurement that is equivalent to one 






666 Dilber Ulas  / Procedia Computer Science 158 (2019) 662–671 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000–000 5 


billionth of a meter. Nanotechnology deals with nanomaterials which have at least one dimension 
ranging from 1 to 100 nm.It can be easily understood how small measurement nanometre has when 
we consider that hair strand of human is approximately 100.000 nanometre [9].Nanotechnology can 
be defined as  application of scientific knowledge to manipulate and control matterpredominantly in 
the nanoscale (length range approximately from 1 nm to 100 nm) to make use of size- and structure-
dependent properties and phenomena distinct from those associated with individual atoms or 
molecules, or extrapolation from larger sizes of the same material [10]. 
 
1.1.17. Digital Supply Chain: DSC is composed of those systems (e.g. software, hardware, 
communication networks) that support interactions between globally distributed organizations and 
orchestrates the activities of the partners in supply chains. These activities include buying, making, 
storing, moving and selling a product. DSC aim to achieve; speed, flexibility, global connectivity, 
real time inventory, transparency, intelligent, scalability, innovative, proactive, eco-friendly [11]. 


1.1.18. Robotics: Robots each time with more exceptional ability and intelligence used to automate 
tasks, reduced labor costs. – Robots each time with more exceptional ability and intelligence used to 
automate tasks. Greater flexibility and shorter delivery time for products to the market. Vehicles with 
reduced or no human intervention, Advances in interfaces and sensors with better materials and 
ergonomic design. Robotics shift the labour/capital mix while managing societal expectations. End-
user industries are rapidly adopting robots for industrial purposes to  improve the quality of products 
and reduce manufacturing costs. 
 
1.1.19. Advanced manufacturing technologies: Advanced manufacturing technologies which are used 
in manufacturing industry can be those given as; cyber-physical systems, autonomous robots, non-
smart and non-flexible automation systems, smart sensors, manufacturing systems, Computer 
Numerical Control (CNC). 


2. What Have Been Done for Digital Transformation of Manufacturing Industry in Turkey? 


Ministry of Industry and Technology and TÜBİTAK are held as responsible institutions in digital 
transformation processes with a decision taken in the meeting of Supreme Council of Science and 
Technology (BTYK) in February, 2016. “Digital Transformation in Industry Platform” was 
established in 28 December 2016 and working groups were formed under the topics of advanced 
manufacturing techniques (developing of technology, such as 3D printers, robotics sensor and etc.), 
education (forming of qualified man power infrastructure), digital technologies in industry (big data, 
cloud computing, etc.) regulation, standardization, patents (involvement in international studies, 
standards, regulation infrastructure), infrastructure (technologic, physical), open innovation. Primary 
issues of SME’s and entrepreneurs are determined conducting a survey on digitization in industry in 
2017. Collaboration protocol is signed between Ministry of National Education and technical 
colleges. Digital transformation road map was completed in 2018. Protocol on opening of consistent 
education centers in the fields of digital transformation required in 15 research universities is signed. 
Digital technology is added to YOK’s Doctorate programme, a pilot study regarding determination 
of digital maturity level is initiated with TUBİTAK. Decision on supporting of digital transformation 
with KOSGEB & TUBITAK programmes is taken. Key and Leading Technologies Prioritization for 
Smart Manufacturing Systems” survey in which about a thousand enterprises was participated was 
conducted by TÜBİTAK in 2016. Striking results came out at the end of this study. Namely, it is 
determined that 22% of the enterprises have a detailed information when we review  awareness on 
smart manufacturing systems of operations and their integration levels into digital technologies, 
sectors which have a raised awareness are electronics, software and material (rubber, plastic), digital 
maturity level of our industries between Industry 2.0 and 3.0.  Awareness levels of our operations 
regarding fourth industrial revolution are detected in  field work performed with ten thousand

transformation processes with a decision taken in the meeting of Supreme Council of Science and 
Technology (BTYK) in February, 2016. “Digital Transformation in Industry Platform” was 
established in 28 December 2016 and working groups were formed under the topics of advanced 
manufacturing techniques (developing of technology, such as 3D printers, robotics sensor and etc.), 
education (forming of qualified man power infrastructure), digital technologies in industry (big data, 
cloud computing, etc.) regulation, standardization, patents (involvement in international studies, 
standards, regulation infrastructure), infrastructure (technologic, physical), open innovation. Primary 
issues of SME’s and entrepreneurs are determined conducting a survey on digitization in industry in 
2017. Collaboration protocol is signed between Ministry of National Education and technical 
colleges. Digital transformation road map was completed in 2018. Protocol on opening of consistent 
education centers in the fields of digital transformation required in 15 research universities is signed. 
Digital technology is added to YOK’s Doctorate programme, a pilot study regarding determination 
of digital maturity level is initiated with TUBİTAK. Decision on supporting of digital transformation 
with KOSGEB & TUBITAK programmes is taken. Key and Leading Technologies Prioritization for 
Smart Manufacturing Systems” survey in which about a thousand enterprises was participated was 
conducted by TÜBİTAK in 2016. Striking results came out at the end of this study. Namely, it is 
determined that 22% of the enterprises have a detailed information when we review  awareness on 
smart manufacturing systems of operations and their integration levels into digital technologies, 
sectors which have a raised awareness are electronics, software and material (rubber, plastic), digital 
maturity level of our industries between Industry 2.0 and 3.0.  Awareness levels of our operations 
regarding fourth industrial revolution are detected in  field work performed with ten thousand

enterprises in the scope of “Turkey’s Productivity Growth Map Project” by Ministry of Industry and 
Technology in 2016. While enterprises have a knowledge regarding 3D printers, there is less 
recognition of big data, internet of things, cloud computing, RFID technology, open innovation [12]. 
Technology suppliers provide consultancy service for operations regarding cloud computing, big data, 
automation, internet of things, sensor technologies, cyber security, robotics systems. Increase in 
operations willing to use digital technologies depends on increasing of technology suppliers meeting 
applications and solution needs in digitization process of industry operations. Foreign dependency 
regarding that should be reduced. Education programmes’ modules explaining how digital 
technologies are used with good application examples, giving information on digital transformation 
will be presented for SME’s. Turkish Industry & Business Association TÜSİAD  forms 
“Accelerating Programme of Digital Transformation in Industry (TÜSİAD SD)” which gathers micro, 
small and medium sized technology suppliers and technology users with the intent of impowering 
digital transformation process of industry. Information about that programme can be accessed from 
the adress https://tusiadsd2.org/hakkinda. 


3. Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises (SME’s) Digital Transformation Process 


Turkey has changed the definition of small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) in 2019. The 
accepted definition points to those with 1 to 49 employees as “small” and those companies with 50 to 
250 employees as “medium”. In financial terms, an SME would have less than 125  million Turkish 
Liras annually. SME’s consist of 99,83 % total enterprises, and 72,7 % of total employment, 50,6 % 
of total value added and provide 55,1 % of export, take an important role in economy [13]. SME’s 
have many advantages because that are flexible, dynamic, work closely with other people, more 
informal and less bureaucratic than larger organizations [14]. They should transform their 
organizational structures and business making cultures starting from manufacturing technologies to 
management percepts as to get a productive digital transformation process. However the more limited 
resources of SMEs might prevent them to perform digital transformation. In order to carry out digital 
transformation in manufacturing industry, those should come into prominence which are raising 
awareness of SME’s about digital transformation, increasing competence oflabor power, providing 
technical and financial support for  SME’s about that issue, strengthening the data communication 
infrastructure. To perform digital transformation; 


1. It is required that the management is asking for data-based digital transformation, to be determined 
who will be responsible what for. Transformation must be led by the owner or manager. SMEs current 
situation needs to be analyzed to identify challenges, risks, or changed customer expectations. SMEs 
with the requirements and needs analysis, which enables them to cleraly define measurable goals. The 
management can review digitalization topics and what new technologies can contribute and explore 
new business models. And than offer benchmarks and training to support SMEs. 
 
2. Adopting of “learning culture” in SMEs is essential for digital transformation of operations. The 
world and society are changing at an unprecedented pace.  It is needed to have skilled employees, to 
educate the current employees, to create an inventory of required abilities and skills and to detect 
gaps. It is vital to compete with new markets as Google, Amozon, Facebook, Apple. Employment of 
people who have digital skills should be taken into consideration (IT specialists, and socioeconomic 
support professionals). 
 
3. Defining  a simple roadmap of business goals or digital transformation: Based on the digital 
transformation, objectives with regards to DT are defined. These objectives relate to time, finances, 
space, and quality (design SMEs new digital strategy, analysis of SME’s existing business model, 
customers requirements, digital evaluation and expectations, set objectives, competence development, 
collection of best practices for digital transformation, design digital business models options, 






668 Dilber Ulas  / Procedia Computer Science 158 (2019) 662–671 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000–000 7 


information technology  use and understanding, evaluation, design of digital value network, feedback 
from customers) [15]. 
 
4. Creation of an awareness of  digital and a supportive environment.‘To use IT to develop my 
enterprise’; ‘To measure the impact of IT tools (e.g. ROI, sales, performance)’; ‘To link my 
expectations with the reality of apparent user-friendly IT turnkey platforms’; ‘To be better informed 
about available IT training’; and ‘To establish transparent communications between entrepreneurs 
and IT specialist about expectation and deliverables to avoid a deception’ [16]. 
 
5. Collaboration with SME helpers, innovation labs, research institutions. In order to realize the digital 
transformation, it may be helpful to consult with companies that have expertise in this field, and to 
obtain consultancy services. Guiding the SMEs through current trends and demonstrate their 
importance based on practical examples (best-practice, real-life examples). 
 
6. Support SMEs with the requirements and needs analysis, implement feasible objectives. It is 
essential that SMEs which ask for digital transformation should be supported by governments. With 
the aid of government agencies and other stakeholders such as the Trade Association and Chambers, 
SMEs  may be better able to access more assistance in their digital transformation process [17]. Also 
external supporters such as competence centers or research institutions can help SMEs to understand 
and implement digital transformations initiatives. 
 
The needs of SMEs in digital transformation process can vary. It is required to privatise the content 
by means of size of enterprise, sector and SME. Electronic operation is an operation’s adopting of 
other business processes, such as supply, manufacturing, marketing, sale, finance, accounting, human 
resources to new technology. Digitisation requires radical changes not only in terms of strategy, but 
also in terms of culture within the company. According to Azhari et al. the model for the digital 
transformation is include eight dimensions of digitisation, namely strategy, leadership, products, 
operations, culture, people, governance and technology. The first level, “unaware”, describes 
companies in which there is no strategy for digital transformation, nor are there any digital 
competencies available. These companies do not yet offer any digital products or services, and are 
missing an overall organisational awareness for the need of digital transformation. Companies 
classified by the “conceptual” level, are those which offer a few digital products, but are still without 
a digital strategy. Those with a “defined” level of digitisation, are the companies who are able to 
consolidate experiences gained from pilot implementations into partial strategies. At this stage, a 
culture of digital thinking is taking root in the company. The profitability of these partial strategies 
and the effects of the pilot implementations are assessed and used to develop an overall digital 
strategy. At this point, where a clear digital strategy is developed, the company falls into the 
“integrated” maturity level. Only once this strategy has been implemented across all products and 
business processes, can the company be classified as “transformed”. The now-defined digital strategy 
will have transformed the business and operations models of the company. Whilst the maturity model 
provides a good way for companies to classify themselves into a category of digital maturity, it 
provides no guidance for increasing the maturity level [18]. For example e-commerce needs some 
specific changes. Those are business processes and marketing, technological structure, product and 
services (offers), market (buyers and suppliers), relations (suppliers and distributors, customers, 
employees, business partners).E-business model substantially change the fields such as order picking, 
order fulfillment, storing, customers relations after sale of traditional management; bring new 
innovations regarding speed, quality, cost advantages, customers’ satisfaction. Direct communication 
can be made with consumer and industrial markets, applications, such as personal manufacturing, 
direct marketing, e-customer relations management are worked on [19].  Past studies have examined 
technologies in general and have found a number of factors impacting the adoption decision of 
information and communications technologies (ICTs) in organizations. These factors can be 
classified: Firms Characteristics (including size, type pf business), past experiences, privacy and

security (concerns about Internet security, concerns about legal issues, resistance to change, lack of 
finance, high cost of computers and network, lack of qualified personnel, limited knowledge of the 
required technology, infrastructure, lack of marketing, competition, finding reliable technological 
management consultants  andtechnology suppliers, providing guidelines for appropriate hardware and 
software, ICT and e-commerce adoption (digital transformation support programs) [20], lack of a 
technological roadmap and an ecosystem for digital transformation (stakeholders such as technology 
suppliers, investors, public, users, educational institutions), lack of information sharing programs, 
legislative needs arising with the digital transformation, ensuring a reliable environment [21]. SMEs 
have access to IT applications that support a number of business functions(e.g. Google Analytics for 
marketing; Amazon, PayPal for e-commerce or other social media solutions, including Facebook 
which offers a range of features for SMEs; Skype, Teamviewer and Messenger for collaboration, etc.). 
The programs and software that SMEs can use to perform digital transformation, and can benefit from 
it, are explained in the table 1.

4. Conclusion 


The main purpose of digital transformation is to redesign the organizational business through the 
introduction of digital technologies, achieving benefits such as productivity improvements, cost 
reductions and innovation. Digital transformation is functional use of internet in design, 
manufacturing, marketing, selling, presenting and is data-based management model. Obstacles in 
adopting of digital transformation are budget deficiencies of SME’s, impossibility of investment due 
to high investments and operational costs, unability to understand internet technologies, 
inconveniency of sector, data security, privacy concern, technological developments, insufficient 
information regarding digital standards, being unaware of the benefits of digitization, having 
connection problems, lack of qualified employment. While many SMEs have increasingly realised 
that the internet is a key to success, in many cases they still don’t have a website that can be viewed 
on a smartphone. SMEs use the internet for a variety of purposes. Most of SMEs use it for finding out 
general information relating to the business, customer emails, online banking, paying bills, ordering 
supplies and paying taxes online.The fact that classic business models have been disappearing and 
substituted for business models which are flexible, changeable instantly, having real-time responses 
to consumers’ habits and are knowledge-based. SME’s being able to perform cost-benefit analysis of 
digital technologies and being aware of that technologies is significant. 
 
Lastly, the government has also a role to play to stimulate digital transformation of SMEs. The 
proposed government interventions include evaluating how the current legal and regulatory 
framework enhances digital transformation. In addition, the government may provide incentives to 
SMEs that are embarking on the digital transformation process and e-commerce-related assistance 
through government agencies that are already established to assist SMEs. When the changes in 
business world as a result of Industry 4.0 are reviewed, it is drawn attention that manufacturing and 
manufacturing process become practical. Today, the ones, who are able to be afloat in rapidly 
increasing digital era, are people and SMEs keeping up with that technology era.
