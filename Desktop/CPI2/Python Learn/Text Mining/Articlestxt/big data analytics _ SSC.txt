The effect of big data on the lean, agile, resilient, and green (LARG) supply chain has not been 
explored much in the literature. This study investigates the role of ‘Big Data Analytics’ (BDA) as a 
mediator between ‘sustainable supply chain business performance’ and key factors, namely, lean 
practices, social practices, environmental practices, organisational practices, supply chain prac-
tices, financial practices, and total quality management. A sample of 297 responses from thirty- 
seven Indian manufacturing firms was collected. The paper is beneficial for managers and 
practitioners to understand supply chain analytics, and it addresses challenges in the management 
of LARG practices to contribute to a sustainable supply chain.   


1. Introduction 


Big Data Analytics (BDA), which redefined the field of operations management, has been termed a “game-changer” (Wamba and 
Akter, 2015). The five major fields of BDA applications are additive manufacturing, predictive analysis, material science, autonomous 
vehicles, and borderless supply chains (Fawcett and Waller, 2014). BDA in the supply chain (SC) can increase the return on investment 
(ROI) by 15–20% (Perrey et al., 2013), improve competitiveness (Wamba et al., 2015), mitigate risk (Bi et al., 2016), and boost 
visibility (McAfee et al., 2012). BDA has the potential to change SC performance radically through process design, supplier integration, 
and customer integration (Gunasekaran et al., 2016). Through data-driven SC, organisations can gain competitive advantages 
(Schoenherr and Speier-Pero, 2015) and handle market turbulence effectively (Gunasekaran et al., 2018). 


The sustainability aspect of the supply chain has social, economic, and environmental elements (Carter and Liane Easton, 2011). 
LARG practices assist sustainable SC through lean practices (Chun Wu, 2003; Dora et al., 2016), SC agility (Baramichai et al., 2007), SC 
resilience (Cabral et al., 2012), and green practices (Srivastava, 2007). LARG SC assists in lowering production lead-time and trans-
portation time, improving integration level, and achieving effective information exchange (Alqudah et al., 2020). Lean SC

interconnects the interdependent partners for the elimination of all waste through techniques such as value chain analysis (Taylor and 
Pettit, 2009; Dey et al., 2019). SC resilience is the reactive capability to shock or disruption (Blackhurst et al., 2011). Manufacturing 
firms in developing economies, such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and India, have already started the implementation of LARG practices 
(Rao, 2005; Digalwar et al., 2020). With India becoming an important manufacturing hub, effective implementation of LARG SC has 
turned out to be an important benchmarking tool (Chavez et al., 2020; Wong et al., 2018). 


BDA supports SC sustainability by strengthening capabilities and minimising uncertainties and risks (Wu et al., 2017). BD capa-
bilities help with regular operations and processes, reduction in lead and cycle times, focused factory, and mass customisation (Mǐsić 
and Perakis, 2020). BD processing enhances SCs’ agility (Giannakis and Louis, 2016) and resilience (Papadopoulos et al., 2017). With 
BD, an implementation of the green supply chain with better data quality control and integrated data acquisition is possible (Zhao 
et al., 2017). BD provides plenty of opportunities in SC in terms of supplier performance measurement (Addo-Tenkorang and Helo, 
2016), SC analytics (Arunachalam et al., 2018), SC agility (Fosso Wamba et al., 2018), SC sustainability (Hazen et al., 2016; Papa-
dopoulos et al., 2017), and SC innovation (Tan et al., 2015). However, manufacturing firms need to understand BDA in SC from the 
context of organisational performance (Akter et al., 2016). In addition, the influence of BDA on sustainable business performance and 
LARG is not entirely clear and needs more investigation (Gunasekaran et al., 2017). 


Firms need to use sustainable practices due to public pressure, the concerns of the customer, and government regulations (Lee and 
Zhang, 2019). Bhanot et al. (2017) argued that sustainable manufacturing is the most significant element of sustainable SC. BDA 
capabilities can help manufacturing firms to achieve social dimensions (Wadmann and Hoeyer, 2018) and economic benefits 
(Papadopoulos et al., 2017), while minimizing the environmental impacts (Hazen et al., 2016). BDA can also integrate the data re-
sources in the SC to minimize pollutant emissions and energy consumption (Song et al., 2018). Past studies on BDA for carbon 
emissions (Doolun et al., 2018; Song and Wang, 2015a), agile SC (Gunasekaran et al., 2018), SC flexibility (Dubey et al., 2018a), and 
resilient SC (Suifan et al., 2019) show a positive effect of data analytics on LARG. However, these studies discuss the lean, agile, 
resilient, and green aspects separately. With this motivation, this study aims to understand the mediating role of BDA on sustainable SC 
by considering LARG practices. 


The paper focuses on the linkage between BDA and Sustainable SC Business Performance from a LARG perspective. Firstly, critical 
factors that affect BDA adoption in the sustainable SC in the context of a developing country were finalized through a literature survey. 
The literature on ‘big data analytics,’ ‘lean, agile, resilient and green’, and ‘supply chain management’ were studied. Seven factors, 
namely, total quality management and lean, social, environmental, supply chain, financial, and organisational practices, were iden-
tified from the literature and validated following an expert’s input. Factor analysis was carried out on the collected data to determine 
the regression weights and significance of constructs. Identified constructs of BDA adoption for sustainable SC were analysed using the 
structural equation modelling (SEM) approach. SEM assesses observable and unobservable constructs of BDA implementation through 
empirical analysis. The focus of the study is to understand whether BDA acts as a mediator to influence the business performance of a 
sustainable supply chain when considering LARG aspects. Thus, this study explores the impact of BDA on the supply chain performance 
of Indian manufacturers with the effective implementation of sustainable and LARG practices. 


The rest of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 presents a literature survey on LARG SC, BDA and SC, BDA adoption in SC 
practices, and BDA for sustainable SC. Then, Section 3 provides the proposed model and hypothesis. Next, Section 4 presents the 
research methodology, and the empirical results are presented in Section 5. Section 6 summarises the analysis and discussion, and this 
is followed by the conclusion in Section 7. 


2. Literature survey 


This section is divided into four sub-sections: i) LARG SC, ii) BDA and SC, iii) BDA for sustainable SC, and iv) research gaps. 


2.1. LARG (lean, agile, resilient and green) supply chain 


The ‘lean’ paradigm refers to ‘a series of activities or solutions to eliminate waste, reduce non-value-added operations, and improve 
the value added (Dora et al., 2014; Wu and Wee, 2009, pp. 336). Lean production can be achieved through the ‘just in time’ (Chun Wu, 
2003) and ‘zero inventory’ (Lyu et al., 2020) strategy. ‘Agile’ means to respond to rapidly changing demands in variety and volume

(Larson and Chang, 2016). According to Baramichai et al. (2007), agility in the SC allows business partners to react to a changing 
market, with end-to-end information visibility, customised services, and customised products. Unlike the ‘lean’ paradigm, the ‘resil-
ient’ paradigm responds to unexpected disturbances to achieve a competitive advantage (Cabral et al., 2012; Dora and Gellynck, 
2015). Even though the resilient SC may not be the lowest-cost SC, it is equipped for disruptive shocks. The ‘green’ SC refers to an 
integrated mindset in SC from the environmental perspective, with green material selection and sourcing, green design, green 
manufacturing, green delivery, green consumption, and green end-of-life product management (Srivastava, 2007). 


The LARG SC needs to consider all four paradigms. Table 1 shows divergences and synergies of the same (Carvalho et al., 2011). 
Table 1 shows the synergies and divergences between elements of the LARG paradigm within SC attributes. The synergies are 


related to i) reduction of lead time in transportation, ii) reduction of lead time in production, iii) increase in level of integration, and iv) 
increase in frequency of information. However, frequency of information is without consequence in the green paradigm. Thus, LARG 
paradigms supplement one another. SC attributes, such as capacity surplus, replenishment frequency, and inventory level, affect the 
resilient paradigm in a positive way but the green paradigm in a negative way. These three attributes pull in opposite directions in the 
lean and agile paradigm. Thus, enterprises must establish relationships between different paradigms for SC to be efficient, streamlined, 
and sustainable. 


2.2. BDA and supply chain 


BDA capabilities can assist with SC functions, such as procurement, warehousing, manufacturing, demand management, trans-
portation/logistics, and general SC (Govindan et al., 2018). The current literature shows other research articles in manufacturing and 
transportation/logistics (Inamdar et al., 2020). Critical activities in SC manufacturing are production planning and control (PPC), 
product research and development (product R & D), maintenance and diagnosis, and quality management. BDA adoption in PPC is 
attracting interest from many researchers, and BDA tools and techniques in this area are relatively mature (Zhong et al., 2015). The 
BDA approach was used to predict online market sale performance (Li et al., 2016). Wang and Zhang (2016) proposed the BDA 
framework to forecast the cycle time for a semiconductor manufacturer. In addition, BDA can be used for the maintenance and 
manufacturing of complex products (Zhang et al., 2017), intelligent manufacturing (Zhong et al., 2017a, 2017b), and RFID-facilitated 
production data (Zhong et al., 2016). Quality management is another area in manufacturing in which BDA is extensively used (Wang 
et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017). Despite the usage of BDA in maintenance and diagnosis in its initial stage, research in the use of BDA in 
servitization (Opresnik and Taisch, 2015) and workers’ behaviour (Guo et al., 2016) is attracting attention. Kumar et al. (2016a) 
proposed BD to diagnose faults in cloud manufacturing using the MapReduce framework. In two different studies in the Indian context, 
Narwane et al. (2020) emphasized the positive impact of cloud computing and the Internet of Things (IoT) on firm performance. BDA is 
in its nascent stage for product R & D. Tan et al. (2015) proposed a BDA framework based on the deduction graph to enhance the 
capabilities of SC innovation. 


Logistic planning, intelligent transport systems, and in-transit inventory management can all benefit from the adoption of BDA. 
Some of the studies on BDA-based intelligent transport systems include the prediction of traffic flow (Li et al., 2015), smart trans-
portation (Wang et al., 2016), real-time safety monitoring of expressway traffic (Shi and Abdel-Aty, 2015), and efficient path planning 
for vehicles (Zhang et al., 2016). BDA research in logistics planning is basically focused on optimisation and simulation. Lee (2017) 
proposed the BDA optimisation model for anticipatory shipping by using a genetic algorithm. Zhao et al. (2017) proposed an opti-
misation model using BDA for the green SC. Mehmood et al. (2017) used the Markovian approach to explore the effect of BDA on 
transportation, whereas Shan and Zhu (2015) used GPS big data for the same. 


The BDA application in SC procurement is primarily seen in three areas, namely, supplier selection, obtaining improvements in risk,

and cost optimisation (Huang and Handfield, 2015). The study measures the benefits of ERP to the SC maturity model using the BDA 
approach. Choi et al. (2018) proposed a fuzzy reasoning map based on BD to prioritise the procurement of IT services. BDA application 
in SC warehousing is mostly used in three areas, namely, order picking (Li et al., 2016), storage assignment (Tsai and Huang, 2015), 
and inventory control (Hofmann, 2017). Tsai and Huang (2015) investigated consumer moving behaviour and purchasing using a data 
mining approach. Hofmann (2017) studied the impact of the three V’s of BD, namely, variety, volume, and velocity, on SC decisions 
using the bullwhip effect. It must be noted that BDA applications in demand management are not discussed much in the literature 
(Nguyen et al., 2018). BDA capabilities are used in demand shaping with lower prices for customers and an efficient market in terms of 
energy (Ho and Shih, 2014). Data sensing and data forecasting is another area of demand management that is receiving the attention of 
researchers (Li et al., 2016). 


BDA adoption in SC practices in different countries is as shown in Table 2. Various authors have proposed only the conceptual 
framework of BDA in SC as follows: BDA capability for SC (Arunachalam et al., 2018), BD with IoT – value-adding (Addo-Tenkorang 
and Helo, 2016), BDA for collaborative SC (Fawcett and Waller, 2014), BDA for the design and operation of SC (Waller and Fawcett, 
2013a), and a maturity model of BDA in SC and logistics (Wang et al., 2016). These studies discussed various significant factors of BDA 
for SC, as listed in Table 2. Hazen et al. (2016), Waller and Fawcett (2013b), Fosso Wamba et al. (2018), and Zhong et al. (2016) have 
conducted conceptual studies of the usage of BD in SC. Sustainability aspects were prominently discussed in these articles, which used 
exploratory analysis tools to understand BDA adoption for SC in various countries. As listed in Table 2, these studies were carried out in 
developed countries like the USA, China, and France, as well as in developing and underdeveloped countries like India and Nepal. This 
shows that all types of economies are keen to adopt BDA. However, it must be noted that the challenges faced in these countries differ, 
as their levels of technological advancement are different. Very few authors, such as Zhong et al. (2015) and Zhao et al. (2017), used 
the case study approach. Also, a hybrid approach in methodology (Dev et al., 2018), cause-and-effect relationships amongst the critical 
factors of SC (Wu et al., 2017), and cross-country surveys (Dubey et al., 2019b) were rarely discussed in the literature. 


2.3. BDA for sustainable supply chain 


BDA positively influences all three aspects of sustainability (economic, environmental, and social) (Raut et al., 2019). Past studies 
in BDA for SC show improvements in competitiveness, productivity, and efficiency (Song et al., 2018; Wamba et al., 2015). Song and 
Wang (2015a) analysed carbon emissions and found that economic growth and the effect of energy intensity were significant factors 
influencing the same. Knowledge trade impacts environmental sustainability through progress in technology (Song et al. 2019). In a 
BDA study carried out for the Malaysian automotive SC, Doolun et al. (2018) found a reduction in CO2 emissions, effective decision- 
making, supplier collaboration, and a reduction in the total cost of SC. Meanwhile, a BDA-centred humanitarian SC shows a positive 
effect on swift trust, flexibility, collaboration, and control (Dubey et al., 2019b). BDA also assists agile SC with operational flexibility 
and business performance for the determined objectives of an organisation (Gunasekaran et al., 2018). In addition, BDA can assist the 
government in a sustainable society with effective strategies toward resource management (Song et al., 2015b). However, BDA for 
sustainable SC faces challenges, particularly in developing and underdeveloped economies such as India and Bangladesh. Moktadir 
et al. (2019) studied barriers to BDA in the fields of manufacturing and SC. Their study classified barriers into four different categories, 
namely, i) expertise and investment-related barriers, such as research facilities, IT personnel, funding, and cost; ii) technology-related 
barriers, such as lack of interest, infrastructure, and availability; iii) data-related barriers, such as privacy, performance, quality, 
complexity in data integration, and scalability; and iv) organizational-related barriers, such as lack of policy, time constraints, training, 
and mind-set. 


2.4. Research gaps 


Through the literature survey and synthesis, the authors found that developed countries, such as the UK, the USA, and China, have 
started BDA adoption in SC (Arunachalam et al., 2018; Chavez et al., 2017; Hazen et al., 2014). Developing countries are not far 
behind, and various studies, such as the works of Dubey et al. (2018a) and Jeble et al. (2018), show that issues of BDA adoption in SC 
are different in developed and developing countries. Extant studies have mainly focused on LARG SC, BDA for SC (Nguyen et al., 2018; 
Hazen et al., 2016), and BDA for sustainable SC (Moktadir et al., 2019; Dubey et al., 2019b). However, research papers very rarely 
discuss BDA adoption for LARG SC. Hence, this study tries to bridge this gap by investigating the effect of lean management, social 
practices, financial practices, environmental practices, etc. on BDA. 


Manufacturing firms that have already implemented LARG practices in SC can further enhance sustainable business performance 
through BDA. Current research shows the positive effects of BDA on sustainable performance (Raut et al., 2019), SC agility (Dubey 
et al., 2018a), SC KPI (Dev et al., 2018), and sustainable SC (Papadopoulos et al., 2017). However, the BDA effect on sustainable SC 
that have implemented LARG practices is rarely investigated. Raut et al. (2019) investigated the mediating role of BDA on sustainable 
business performance for Indian manufacturing firms. However, the study considered only the lean and green parameters of LARG 
practices and did not consider the effects of the agile and resilient parameters. The prime concern of Indian manufacturers is to build an 
agile SC to respond to unexpected and sudden market changes. This study overcomes the shortcoming of Raut et al. (2019) by 
investigating the effect of LARG practices on BDA. Thus, it investigates the mediating role of BDA on sustainable SC business per-
formance. It must be noted that understanding the effect of BDA adoption will assist manufacturing firms in the effective imple-
mentation of sustainable practices in SC. 


In this paper, empirical analysis is used to understand the impact of BDA adoption on the sustainable SC performance of Indian 
manufacturing firms. Structural equation modelling (SEM) assesses unobservable and observable constructs of BDA. The proposed

study considers only linear relationships through SEM. However, non-linear relations using tools like artificial neural networks can be 
considered in future studies. Other limitations of the study are given in Section 7. 


3. Conceptual framework and proposed hypothesis 


Based on the above synthesis of the literature survey, Fig. 1 shows a proposed conceptual framework. It consists of 9 factors: 
Organizational Practices (OP), Lean Management Practices (LMP), Supply Chain Management Practices (SCMP), Social Practices in 
Supply Chain (SPSC), Environmental Practices (ENP), Financial Practices (FP), Total Quality Management (TQM), Big Data Analytics 
(BDA), and Sustainable supply chain business performance (SSBP). The details are shown in Table 3. BDA is a mediator amongst SSBP 
and the other seven factors that is OP, LMP, SCMP, SPSC, ENP, FP, and TQM. To finalize these shortlisted factors, the Delphi method 
was used (Skulmoski et al., 2007). A preliminary questionnaire with these nine factors was given to thirteen experts and qualitative 
feedback was collected. The Delphi expert panel approved all the factors. As per the technical specifications of identified factors, 
logical grouping was performed. A pilot study was carried out in ten manufacturing firms to confirm the grouping. A five-point Likert 
scale was used to collect 112 responses. After the pilot study, the 67 sub-factors were reduced to 59. Table 1 gives the finalized sub- 
factors along with factors of BDA for Sustainable SC Business Performance. These factors must be considered together to have a holistic 
understanding of LARG and BDA on a sustainable SC performance. 


4. Research methodology 


Fig. 2 shows the adopted research methodology. 
Initially, a literature survey was conducted on LARG, BDA, and SC. Based on inputs from experts and a pilot study, 9 variables with 


59 items for sustainable SC business performance through BDA were finalized. The survey of managers and engineers was carried out 
followed by factorial analysis. 


An exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis approach was used to test the hypothesis. Factorial analysis has a long history in 
market research. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) helps when there are no prior assumptions about the factor structure (Marsh et al., 
2014). EFA uses a five-step protocol as follows (Steger, 2006; Henson and Roberts, 2006; Williams et al., 2010): suitability of data, 
factor extraction method, criteria for factor extraction, rotational method selection, and interpretation. Further, according to Bryant 
and Yarnold (1995), the researcher must have a robust theory underlying the proposed measurement model prior to data analysis. In 
confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), the hypothesized model is used to estimate a matrix of population covariance, which needs to be

Factor Description Sub-factors (Items) Reference 


H1 Organisational Practices 
(OP) 


The start of the path to achieving long-term goals 
is an organisational practice. BDA here becomes a 
factor while building a strategy that increases the 
overall performance of the firm. The strategy helps 
in improving the efficiency of the operations, such 
as inventory and sales optimisation: analysis of 
each strategy helps in the decision-making 
process. The training and education of personnel 
in any enterprise – i.e., both BDA and 
manufacturing SC – enhance the value of the use of 
BDA in manufacturing SC. This could apply to all 
types of training for all kinds of people in the 
chain, including the employees, suppliers and 
customers.

H2 Lean Management 
Practices (LMP) 


Organisations should focus on lean practices. 
Minimizing waste can be achieved through lean 
practices. With techniques such as Just in Time 
(JIT) and cellular manufacturing, the 
manufacturing firms can benefit. BDA helps in 
developing a lean management model of internal 
processes that can help in making a standardised 
process and minimise waste. BDA increases the 
efficiency in processes; it also helps in achieving 
technical and organisational flexibility and can 
identify inefficiencies in the organisation.

H3 Supply Chain 
Management Practices 
(SCMP) 


Manufacturing data has to be shared with the 
suppliers in order to get the required material 
available in the market, which will lead to a 
sustainable business strategy. BDA helps in 
selecting optimal suppliers and vendors and helps 
in increasing firms’ negotiation power. Improved 
integration with suppliers leads to better decision- 
making, reduction in waste and a high level of 
performance. BDA capabilities can enhance the 
supply chain performance also reduces SC risk. 
Supplier selection can be achieved more 
effectively as the involvement of suppliers is most 
important.

H4 Social Practices in 
Supply Chain (SPSC) 


Government policies need to help in promoting 
advanced manufacturing and SC. The government 
plays a substantial role in research and the 
development of new manufacturing technologies, 
and with proper legal support, these ideas and 
firms’ crucial data can be protected and future 
misuse prevented. Local bodies and NGOs can play 
a significant role in the acceptance of LARG and 
BDA by the masses. Organizations must form 
regulatory norms to promote the BDA and LARG 
practices.

H5 Environmental Practices 
(ENP) 


In this competitive ecosystem, environmental 
practices lead to gaining a competitive advantage 
over others. Environmental practices refer to eco- 
design, waste management, cellular 
manufacturing, and reduction in energy usage. 
BDA ensures better environmental practices and 
enables them to gain economic values. Thus BDA 
and LARG can transform practices more effectively 
with eco packaging, reduction in carbon 
footprints, and recycling

compared with the matrix of observed covariance (Hemmelgarn et al., 1995; Schreiber et al., 2006; Strauss and Smith, 2009). Accepted 
constructs, observed variable patterns, and latent constructs in CFA are further used for SEM analysis (Chan et al., 2007). SEM en-
hances the analysis and provides added flexibility (Blanthorne et al., 2006). SEM is a statistical technique that was used initially for 
marketing theory (Bagozzi, 1980). Later, it became popular in studies of social sciences and behavioural studies for theory testing 
(MacCallum and Austin, 2000). SEM incorporates dependent variables, latent constructs, and independent variables to analyse the 
multivariate data. In this paper, the following goodness-of-fit indices were considered: normed fit index (NFI), goodness-of-fit index 
(GFI), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and comparative fit index (CFI). Further, in this study, the analysis of 
moment structures (AMOS) program was selected, as it can read SPSS files and gives excellent quality path diagrams. Thus, this study 
uses the EFA-CFA-SEM approach for data analysis. The sample characteristics and details for data collection are provided in the 
following section. 


4.1. Sample characteristics 


The survey was targeted at individuals in SC operations, who were asked to respond to issues related to manufacturing. Indian 
manufacturers who had already adopted or were in the process of adopting LARG practices were selected for the survey, and managers 
and engineers from these firms who dealt with SC operations were selected for sample collection. Appendix A shows the questionnaire 
used for the survey. Initially, thirty-seven such manufacturing firms were selected. Data was collected during a three-month period 
through personal interactions and Google sheets. After one month, a gentle reminder was sent to non-responding firms. After two 
months, a telephonic request was made to the individual participants. Qualitative research often faces practical challenges in data 
collection. Some of the major challenges faced in this research were gaining access to the manufacturing firms and key participants, 
incorporating online technologies, data confidentiality, and time constraints. However, with persistence, out of a total of 354 responses 
received, 297 were found to be valid. Sample characteristics are as shown in Table 4: manufacturers with more than 250 employees 
formed the largest proportion of responses (116, 39.06%). In terms of organisation turnover, the highest responses were from firms 
with a turnover of 15–30 million dollars (130, 43.77%). The highest responses in terms of experience were from respondents with 
5–10 years’ experience (172, 57.91%) and, in terms of education, were from undergraduates (188, 63.30%).

for investment, change over time is a major 
concern for the top management. BDA helps the 
manufacturing firm to use financial resources and 
use the right technology efficiently. However, 
return on investment (ROI) must be calculated 
carefully.

H7 Total Quality 
Management (TQM) 


Data, if they are to be used effectively in 
manufacturing firms, need to have the proper 
quality of information, being both thorough and 
orderly. Industry practices such as TQM require 
such high standards of quality to be maintained, 
and this is what decides the competitive stature of 
the organisation. HRM plays an essential role in 
TQM. The integration of BDA in the system would 
affect information quality and business value to 
give meaningful insights into SC operations.

H8 Sustainable Supply 
Chain Business 
Performance (SSBP) 


Sustainable business performances are measured 
in terms of the four ground terms. It then becomes 
the firms’ societal responsibility to maintain a 
sustainable system. BDA empowers the 
organisations to gain control over operational 
costs and aims to reduce them (better flexibility, 
improved product quality, lesser lead time); it 
enables the firms to build a brand image and create 
a fad in the market. BDA helps with avoiding 
environmental accidents by monitoring chemical 
usage and waste disposal. BDA surely enables us to 
acquire a good share in the competitive market.

5. Results 


5.1. EFA 


In this study, the Sustainable SC Business Performance of manufacturing firms through BDA adoption was measured using a survey- 
based method. Nine constructs were measured through a quantitative and qualitative approach. A two-phase approach was used to 
measure items of eleven constructs. In phase 1, the construct and the item dimension were defined, along with the validity and

reliability of undefined indicators. In phase 2, a questionnaire based on a five-point Likert scale was developed in order to understand 
the effect of BDA adoption. In the final survey, the authors received 297 valid responses from managers and engineers who were 
involved with their firms’ SC operations. To test the appropriateness of data, a Bartlett’s test and a Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) test were 
carried out. The results show that the KMO value was 0.851, which was satisfactory, as it was greater than 0.6. In the Bartlett’s test, 
significance (p-value) for a 95% confidence level must be <0.05; the p-value for the present study was 0.000. In this study, principal 
component analysis (PCA) was the extraction method, while the rotation method used was varimax (with Kaiser Normalization). The 
rotated component matrix (converged in six iterations) is shown in Appendix B. All variables had observed high loadings, i.e., greater 
than 0.5. The highest loading was observed for ‘ENP5′ with a value of 0.941; the lowest loading was for ‘LMP7′, with a value of 0.503. 
Except for ‘LMP7′ and ‘OP1′ (0.567), all variables had loadings greater than 0.6, and no cross-loading was observed. Thus, the results of 
EFA are satisfactory for further CFA analysis. 


5.2. CFA 


CFA was performed on seven constructs of BDA adoption and one construct of Sustainable SC Business Performance. All of these 
eight constructs were allowed to correlate freely with each other. The construct ‘Sustainable SC Business Performance’ had eight items. 
Only two constructs, namely ‘BDA adoption’ and ‘Lean management practices’, had eight items; all other constructs had fewer than 
eight items. CFA results show a chi-square test to the degree of freedom ratio 1.922 (<3.0), and CFI 0.916 (>0.90). RMSEA is 0.056, 
which is not <0.05. However, 0.05–0.10 is the moderate range of RMSEA, while GFI (0.942) is not higher than 0.95; nonetheless, it is 
within the permissible limit, and thus RMSEA and GFI are acceptable. Thus, it can be concluded that for the collected dataset, the 
goodness-of-fit statistics have acceptable values. 


CFA model estimates are shown in Appendix C. Loadings between factors and measured variables were greater than 0.5, except for 
LMP7 (mass customisation), with a value of 0.362, and SPSC2 (Involvement of NGOs and local bodies), with a value of 0.471. Thus, the 
acceptable level of convergent validity is shown by the loading of indicators in distinct constructs (Barki and Hartwick, 2001). It must 
be noted that measurement model loadings were mostly greater than 0.6, except for a few loadings, as follows: Understanding of lean 
(LMP1 with a value of 0.511); Top management support (OP1 with a value of 0.537); Organization vision and strategy (OP3 with a 
value of 0.567); Communication between workers and management (OP4 with a value of 0.600); Organizational culture (OP6 with a 
value of 0.574); and Involvement of NGOs and local bodies (SPSC2 with a value of 0.574). This shows acceptable convergent validity. 
The CFA path diagram is shown in Appendix D, which was drawn using AMOS software. 


5.3. SEM 


SEM was carried out in two phases: i) validating the latent constructs and ii) judging the fitting model based on the structural model 
(Jenatabadi, 2015). SEM examines non-causal and causal relationships amongst the variables. It indicates relevant precedence where 
bi-directional arrows in the CFA model must be replaced with single-headed arrows. The developed path diagram is shown in Fig. 3. 
Appendix E shows estimates for the structural model. The SEM results show a chi-square test in which the degree of freedom ratio is 
1.969 (<3.0), and CFI is 0.912 (>0.90). RMSEA is 0.051, which is not < 0.05, though 0.05–0.10 is the moderate range of RMSEA, and 
GFI (0.933) is not higher than 0.95. However, it is within the permissible limit, and thus RMSEA and GFI are acceptable. Thus, the 
authors can conclude that for the collected dataset, the goodness of fit statistics have acceptable values. 


Based on the SEM analysis, all eight hypotheses based on positive relationships between BDA adoption and Organizational

5.4. Robustness check 


In order to check the robustness of the moderating effect of BDA, regression analysis was conducted (Lo et al., 2018). The structural 
model is built in AMOS. The descriptive analysis of the structural model shows sufficiently high values of Cronbach Alpha (Please refer 
to Appendix F). The reliability value of six variables SSBP (0.9634), ENP (0.961), BDA (0.9537), LMP (0.9046), OP (0.9046), and SCMP 
(0.8732) were higher than 0.85 which is considered as “excellent” (Bonett and Wright, 2015). However, the Cronbach Alpha values for 
SPSC (0.8497) and FP (0.8429) were close to 0.85, whereas for TQM (0.7852) was “acceptable” as it is higher than 0.65 (Bonett and 
Wright, 2015). Table 5 gives details of correlation analysis, which gives significant correlations at 95% (2-tailed) and 99% (2-tailed). 


Fig. 4 shows the structural mediation model, and the results of the mediation effect are tabulated in Table 6. There is one Partial 
mediation found for TQM and full mediation for ENP. Moreover, there is no mediation effect found on other variables. Appendix G 
gives the details of regression weights, direct and indirect effects. 


The mediation model explains the casual effect of antecedent on the dependent variable (Hair et al., 2011). Three types of 
mediation effects are i) No Mediation indicating no indirect effect, ii) Partial Mediation indicating both indirect and direct effect, and 
iii) Full Mediation indicating only indirect effect (Lowry and Gaskin, 2014). From Table 6, out of seven hypotheses, two are supported. 
In these two hypotheses, one is fully mediated, and the other is partially mediated. The variable Environmental Practices (ENP) fully 
mediate Sustainable supply chain business performance (SSBP) whereas total Quality Management (TQM) partially mediates the 
relationship. The remaining five variables do not show any mediation effect. The result indicates that the proposed model only focuses 
on environmental practices and total quality, whereas organizational practices, lean management, SC management, social practices, 
and financial practices remain neglected. However, these factors must be considered for BDA adoption in Indian organizations. 


6. Discussion 


In this paper, the BDA role for Sustainable SC Business Performance is analysed through the SEM approach. Table 7 shows the path 
analysis results, which supports all eight hypotheses. Significant factors in order of standardised estimate values are Total Quality 
Management (TQM), Sustainable supply chain business performance (SSBP), Environmental Practices (ENP), Organizational Practices 
(OP), Lean Management Practices (LMP), Supply Chain Management Practices (SCMP), Social Practices in SC (SPSC), and Financial 
Practices (FP). The obtained results were compared with the past literature and are shown under the ‘in contrast with’ and ‘in 
agreement with’ columns in Table 7. 


The study finds that “Total Quality Management (TQM: 0.141)” is the most significant factor; this agrees with Chavez et al. (2017) 
and Dubey et al. (2016). Chavez et al. (2017) surveyed Chinese manufacturing firms and concluded that producing high performance, 
reliability, and consistently high-quality products to meet customer needs was most significant in data-driven manufacturing SC. 
Similarly, the study by Dubey et al. (2016) emphasised TQM techniques, TQM tools, customer satisfaction, supplier quality, quality

standards, and quality management for the successful implementation of BDA for manufacturing. Hence, Indian manufacturers must 
focus on TQM systems with current resources and must train employees to meet customer demands. With the support of top man-
agement, BDA can play an essential role in refining the complete system. 


The study by Dubey et al. (2019a) of Indian manufacturing organisations concluded that BDA capabilities help organisations to 
make the SC resilient and gain competitive advantage. Dev et al. (2018) used an integrated fuzzy ANP-TOPSIS approach to understand 
BDA-based SC performance ability. The study shows that BDA provides a practical approach to a crucial performance index of SC under 
the dynamic situation. In this study, the hypothesis based on SC business performance (SSBP: 0.129) resulted in the second highest 
level of significance. Supply chain analytics can help manufacturing firms to achieve long-time goals along with better firm perfor-
mance. However, achieving operational and technical performance with excellent initial investments is a significant concern in 
developing and underdeveloped countries. 


The study supports the hypothesis on “Environmental Practices (ENP: 0.097)”, which is in line with Jeble et al. (2018). Their study 
was conducted on Indian auto manufacturing firms and emphasised the reduction of air emissions, the use of waste water recycling, 
and the prevention of solid waste and toxic material. This shows that environmental performance is positively associated with business 
performance. The hypothesis on “Organizational Practices (OP: 0.096)” is ranked as per the standard estimate value. It agrees with 
Chen et al. (2015), who proposed a dynamic capability theory to establish the positive effect of organisational factors on BDA. 
However, the study carried out by Dubey et al. (2018b) in Indian auto component manufacturers does not show a positive correlation 
between BDA and organisational capabilities. The hypothesis on “Lean Management Practices (LMP: 0.083)” is ranked fifth and agrees 
with studies carried by Gunasekaran et al. (2017) and Dubey et al. (2016) on Indian manufacturers. The other three hypotheses

supported are shown in Table 7. 
The findings of this study agree with the current literature; however, some results differ from those reported in earlier studies. This 


could be because of the difference in i) sector and economy, ii) internal, external, technical, and non-technical factors towards BDA 
adoption, and iii) type of methodology in past studies. However, the findings will help decision makers to understand significant 
factors for the implementation of BDA for Sustainable SC Business Performance. 


6.1. Theoretical contributions 


The theoretical contributions of the study are as follows:  


• The previous studies have analysed LARG SC and BDA for sustainable SC separately. This study is one of the first to validate linkages 
and correlations and to explore the integration between these perceptions holistically.  


• This study provides tangible evidence that supports the mediating role of BDA for Sustainable SC Business Performance by 
considering seven factors, namely, total quality management, supply chain practices, financial practices, lean practices, organi-
zational practices, social practices, and environmental practices.  


• Manufacturers of developing countries need a theoretical framework to develop BDA for manufacturing SC in the context of LARG 
and sustainability. The study adds value to the current research and literature by providing an understanding of BDA for sustainable 
SC to improve the business performance of manufacturing firms through the proposed framework. 


In summary, sustainable SC needs a BDA revolution, and this study provides researchers and academicians with an in-depth un-
derstanding of the mediating role of BDA by using a case of Indian manufacturing firms. Further, it paves the way for future research 
exploring the mediating role of BDA to achieve firm performance. 


6.2. Managerial contributions 


The significant managerial contributions of the study are as follows:  


• Firstly, this study provides insights to the consultants and managers who involved in digitization initiatives in the context of LARG 
SCs. To implement the new technologies, support from the firm’s top management is essential. Top executives and CEOs must aim 
at long-term benefits. The intervention of policymakers and top management is vital for a BDA adoption. Policymakers can use the 
findings of the study to formulate strategic policies.  


• Secondly, the list of factors and sub-factors can assist supply chain managers as well as production engineers to understand the 
overall implications of BDA. Decision-makers can scrutinize the significant factors of BDA adoption and the LARG paradigm. The 
study reveals that total quality management and environmental practices are most crucial for BDA adoption. Thus, organisations 
must ensure quality management, whereas sustainable practices need to be deliberated through regulation and laws by 
policymakers.  


• Thirdly, the current competitive environment requires manufacturing firms to adopt BDA practices. The proposed framework can 
help with the successful adoption of BDA for Sustainable SC Business Performance for industrialists of emerging economies like 
India. Manufacturing firms can improve their profitability with BDA and LARG capabilities. Firm growth can be hindered by not 
adopting this technology. 


A service provider needs to ensure a timely and reliable service to improve SC performance with LARG and sustainable practices. 
The study assists industrial managers with BDA adoption through practical, sustainable practices, and training. The role of training and 
education becomes crucial to overcome resistance to change and develop trust (De Jong et al., 2020). 


7. Conclusion 


Past research highlights the importance of BDA for sustainable SC and BDA for firm performance separately; our paper integrates 
both in order to understand its impact on the overall business performance of the organisation. In manufacturing firms, sustainable 
practices are extremely important. It is indispensable to have a conceptual model in order to investigate the effect of BDA on Sus-
tainable SC Business Performance, particularly for developing countries. To address this problem, the authors conceptualised BDA 
adoption for sustainable SC of manufacturing firms from India. 


In the proposed framework, the authors identified seven factors affecting intentions to adopt BDA. To validate the conceptual 
model, a survey was conducted among manufacturing firms in India. Developing economies like India need BDA adoption for the 
effective implementation of sustainable practices in manufacturing SC. This study will guide manufacturers in identifying the critical 
factors that affect BDA adoption in sustainable SC. Various stakeholders in SC can understand the particular nature of sub-factors in 
order to adopt BDA. The study can help governing bodies to develop an effective policy for BDA in manufacturing firms. 


The following limitations of the study are acknowledged: i) collection of data was through structured questions; ii) the factor 
Financial Practices (FP) was identified with a very low regression weight; and iii) as the study was conducted on Indian manufacturing 
firms, its findings cannot be generalized beyond this context. The future scope of the paper will be as follows: i) quantitative data 
through questionnaires may be heterogeneous for further studies; and qualitative data collected through structured and semi-

structured interviews could be used; ii) the sample size of data could be increased with different geographical locations, and data 
samples in other developing economies could also be used; and iii) hybrid SEM-ANN could be incorporated to handle the non-linear 
relationships and improve the predictive accuracy. Further studies could be conducted to understand the mediating role of BDA for 
project performance and supply chain-4.0. Furthermore, whether digitalisation through Industry 4.0 improves SC performance can be 
investigated. In addition, the role of artificial intelligence, the circular economy, and BDA could be explored to minimize risk in the 
supply chain.
