This paper conceptualizes digital procurement readiness as a dyadic construct and introduces the supply chain
practice view (SCPV) as a theoretical lens that can help guide future research on digital procurement. We build on
a literature review and on dyadic, explanatory case studies to provide a nuanced understanding of how the
digital readiness of supply chain partners—on both sides of the dyad—needs to co-evolve for the implementation
of digital procurement practices. Specifically, we outline how the SCPV can serve as both a holistic and a supply
chain-specific framework for future research on the following: 1) the antecedents that help explain why supply
chain partners adopt inter-organizational digital procurement practices, and 2) the relational performance
outcomes derived from their use. For managers, this study implies the need to explicitly consider interactions
with and influences of supply chain partners in their quest to rapidly and effectively digitalize procurement.


1. Introduction


Digital procurement practices involve “the use of advanced ‘digital
technologies’ for procurement purposes” (Srai and Lorentz, 2019, p.
15). Advanced digital technologies, such as big data analytics, the In-
ternet of Things, cloud computing, and additive manufacturing, pro-
mise to fundamentally change the way buying firms collaborate with
their supply network around the globe (Batran et al., 2017; Pellengahr
et al., 2016). Leading companies have obtained significant process ef-
ficiencies and cost savings from the use of digital technologies in pro-
curement. For example, BASF has done so by using IBM Watson's arti-
ficial intelligence system to catalog and evaluate its suppliers (McGee,
2018). Despite a few early success cases, the vast majority of firms still
have a long way to go on their digitalization journey. A pilot study on
digital procurement in Europe showed that more than two-thirds of the
participating companies had not yet implemented any advanced digital
technologies (Pellengahr et al., 2016, p. 15). If these firms aim to im-
plement digital procurement practices, a vital first step is to understand
which organizational prerequisites need to be in place for a successful
implementation. When can a company and its purchasing function be
considered ready to embark on the journey toward advanced digital
procurement?


The existing purchasing and supply management (PSM) literature
provides only limited guidance for such a transformation. It has focused


primarily on how the use of digital technologies (e.g., big data analytics,
cloud computing, automated procure-to-pay processes, real-time spend
analytics, and virtual supplier rooms) can create value (Richey et al.,
2016; Srai and Lorentz, 2019). With this focus on the use of technolo-
gies and applications, the literature sheds little light on the organiza-
tional factors that need to be in place prior to use. What prevents the
majority of firms from implementing digital procurement practices at
this point? We know little about the factors that constitute firms’ ability
to embrace and use new digital technologies in procurement. Adopting
the terminology used in the wider field of technology management, we
denote the degree to which firms fulfill these requirements as digital
procurement readiness (Parasuraman, 2000; Richey et al., 2007).


A second limitation of the existing literature on digital procurement
is its strong, if not exclusive, focus on the buying firm, thus widely ne-
glecting supply chain partners’ ability or inability to embrace and use
new digital technologies in their interactions with buying firms.
Procurement, by its nature, is a function that spans firm boundaries and
connects organizations. Many digital procurement technologies connect
systems of the buying firm with systems of the supplier. Thus, digital
readiness is required on both sides of the buyer–supplier dyad so that
the use of the technologies to their full extent becomes possible.
Because of the crucial role of inter-organizational linkages in digital
procurement, we call for a theoretical perspective that explicitly ac-
counts for the dyad and network levels.

Third, because the existing digital procurement literature has a
strong practitioner orientation, the theoretical underpinning of many of
these works is relatively weak (Spina et al., 2016). The few studies that
develop theoretical arguments adopt grand theories from outside the
PSM field, such as the resource-based view (Barney, 1991, 2012).
However, theories specifically developed for the PSM field – or the
broader operations and supply chain management (OSCM) discipline –
could better incorporate key constructs associated with managing the
supply base, such as inter-organizational buyer–supplier relationships
or complex supply networks (Carter et al., 2015; Spina et al., 2016).
This approach to strengthening the theoretical foundation of research
on digital procurement is yet to be explored.


To address these gaps, we seek to provide answers to the following
research questions: 1) How can digital readiness be conceptualized, and
how does it influence the implementation of digital procurement
practices? 2) How can a theoretical perspective that explicitly accounts
for the interplay between the buying firm and supply chain partners help to
guide future research on digital procurement?


Building on the notion that the breadth and depth of the digital
transformation in procurement necessitates both a holistic and a supply
chain-specific theoretical lens, spanning across organizational bound-
aries, we suggest the adoption of the supply chain practice view (SCPV)
(Carter et al., 2017b). The SCPV, a theoretical perspective developed in
the OSCM discipline, posits that firms can use imitable, inter-organi-
zational SCM practices to improve performance in supply chains. Ex-
plicitly opting for the inter-organizational level of analysis, the SCPV
seeks to explain why firms adopt SCM practices and helps to clarify how
the use of SCM practices leads to relational performance in the supply
chain.


To supplement our conceptual development, we conducted ex-
planatory case studies of six buyer–supplier dyads (Dubois and Salmi,
2016; Ketokivi and Choi, 2014). The case studies provide a more
nuanced understanding of how digital readiness on both sides of the
buyer–supplier dyad mutually influences the implementation of digital
procurement technologies.


In sum, this research aims to make three contributions to the PSM
literature. First, it advances the still-embryonic literature on digital
procurement by introducing the SCPV as a comprehensive theoretical
grounding for the discussion of digital procurement. Second, in contrast
to prior PSM research that takes the buying firm as the unit of analysis,
this study adopts a dyadic perspective and accounts for the digital
readiness of both buyers and suppliers. Findings from our explanatory
case studies underscore the importance of this dyadic perspective.
Third, this study extends the prevailing focus on the use of digital
technologies in PSM (Srai and Lorentz, 2019) and investigates their
antecedents as important factors in explaining and understanding the
adoption of digital technologies. In particular, we conceptualize digital
procurement readiness as a critical antecedent on the side of the buying
firm and supplier digital readiness as the necessary complement on the
other side of the dyad.


2. A supply chain practice view on digital procurement


Although the field of PSM is maturing and increasing in relevance,
academic research in the PSM field often lacks a strong theoretical
grounding (Spina et al., 2016) – and research on digital procurement
appears to be no exception. However, a solid theoretical foundation is
indispensable in increasing the OSCM discipline's maturity and in de-
veloping meaningful future research on digital procurement (Spina
et al., 2016; Srai and Lorentz, 2019).


To strengthen the theoretical foundation of research on digital
procurement, two possible, complementary approaches exist (Spina
et al., 2016): First, researchers can adopt (grand) theories from man-
agement and economics, such as the resource-based view (Barney,
1991, 2012) or transaction cost economics (Williamson, 2008), and
apply them to the PSM field and, in particular, to the context of digital


procurement. Extant studies on digital procurement that undertake
such adoption either build on a single theory (e.g., Richey et al., 2016)
or eclectically combine multiple theories (e.g., Srai and Lorentz, 2019).
Adopting grand theories from management and economics helps to root
PSM research in consolidated theoretical frameworks and facilitates
recognition by the broader management research. Second, researchers
can draw on (mid-range) theories developed within the PSM field or in
the broader supply chain discipline. This approach might allow for a
better fit with the specifics of PSM-related phenomena because it ex-
plicitly considers key constructs associated with managing the supply
base, such as sourcing decisions, buyer–supplier relationships, the
supply chain, and supply networks (Carter et al., 2015; Spina et al.,
2016).


Following the second approach, this paper builds on the SCPV
(Carter et al., 2017b) – a theoretical lens that examines how firms can
use imitable, inter-organizational SCM practices to improve relational
performance in supply chains. The SCPV builds on the practice-based
view (Bromiley and Rau, 2014, 2016), which is a theoretical foundation
from strategic management research, and extends it to the inter-orga-
nizational level of analysis. In an SCPV research model, the explanatory
variables seek to answer the question of why firms adopt SCM practices.
In addition, the link between SCM practices and performance helps to
better explain how using SCM practices leads to enhanced relational
performance in the supply chain. In contrast to other theories that focus
on inimitable resources, such as the resource-based view (Barney,
2012) or the relational view (Dyer and Singh, 1998), the SCPV posits
that the use of imitable SCM practices is needed as a means to explain
performance outcomes. The explanatory variables can be viewed as
antecedents or enablers of the SCM practice (Wang et al., 2018).


The SCPV can be a particularly fruitful theoretical lens for research
on digital procurement for two primary reasons: 1) It provides a holistic
view that incorporates the antecedents to and the use of digital tech-
nologies in procurement, as well as the performance outcome; and 2) it
explicitly considers the interplay of the buyer and the supplier by fo-
cusing on the dyad or network level of analysis for each of these ele-
ments. Fig. 1 presents our theoretical model for applying the SCPV to
digital procurement. The model extends previous studies on the use
perspective of digitalization in PSM (Srai and Lorentz, 2019) and pro-
vides a conceptual framework for research on digital procurement
comprising the following three key elements: 1) Digital procurement
readiness on both sides of the buyer–supplier dyad as an explanatory
factor for the adoption of digital technologies; 2) digital procurement
practices to describe the use of digital technologies across organizational
boundaries; and 3) performance, both individual and relational, as the
outcome variable. To expand this basic SCPV model, moderating and
mediating effects can be considered.


In sum, the SCPV provides a coherent and sufficiently robust orga-
nizing framework for guiding research on digital procurement. First,
relating to the explanatory variables, the SCPV helps to answer the
question of why firms adopt digital procurement practices or refrain
from doing so. This link between explanatory variables and the adop-
tion of inter-organizational digital procurement practices is the focus of
the empirical case studies in this paper. Second, relating to the de-
pendent variable of interest, the SCPV encourages researchers to study
which intermediate outcomes and relational performance effects digital
procurement practices have on supply chains. Exemplary research
questions might ask whether digital procurement practices measurably
increase relational performance, or whether practice A is more effective
than practice B. In this paper, we provide initial guidance regarding
possible future research on performance outcomes, based on a review of
the literature and on additional insights from our empirical cases. In the
following sections, we build on a literature review to explain in more
detail how the individual elements of the theoretical model apply to
digital procurement.

2.1. Literature review process


To identify digital procurement practices, relevant explanatory
factors, and performance effects of digital procurement, we conducted
an extensive literature review (Durach et al., 2017a) on digital pro-
curement and organizational readiness. We focused on peer-reviewed
articles in leading academic journals in the disciplines of supply chain
management and information systems (IS) management. These journals
were identified based on strong citation impact factors in the Associa-
tion of Business Schools (2018) journal ranking (Carter et al., 2017a).
For SCM, we included eight leading journals that also have been in-
cluded in previous literature reviews (Johnsen et al., 2016). For IS
management, we included four leading journals, in line with previous IS
management research (Chen et al., 2010). (See Appendix A.) Because of
the nascent stage of the field, we limited our search to articles published
within the past 16 years (i.e., since 2003). To identify relevant pub-
lications on digital procurement, we searched titles, abstracts, and
keywords using the digitalization-related search terms identified by Srai
and Lorentz (2019) (e.g., “digital,” “e-procurement,” and “big data”).
To locate relevant publications on organizational readiness, we sear-
ched titles, abstracts, and keywords using “readiness” as our search
term. This keyword search identified a preliminary sample of 537
journal articles. We then reviewed the titles and abstracts of each article
and eliminated the ones that were not related to a business-to-business
context or that did not have a PSM focus. This review yielded 77 arti-
cles, the full text of which we examined in detail. We further excluded
articles that were not directly related to our research questions because
they focused on, for example, the individual or country level of ana-
lysis. This process resulted in a final sample of 38 core articles con-
taining detailed information about the dimensions of (digital) pro-
curement readiness. In the next subsections, we apply the SCPV to
digital procurement to synthesize the findings from our literature re-
view.


2.2. Digital procurement practices


The term, “digital procurement practices,” refers to the use of “di-
gital technologies,” either individually or in combination, for procure-
ment purposes (Srai and Lorentz, 2019). Srai and Lorentz (2019) dis-
tinguish between basic and advanced digital technologies. Basic digital
technologies mainly include e-procurement, which refers to “the sour-
cing of goods or services via electronic means, usually through the In-
ternet” (Ronchi et al., 2010; Schoenherr and Tummala, 2007). E-pro-
curement applications, such as buyer-side e-RfX systems and electronic


marketplaces, have been used by firms for more than ten years to fa-
cilitate internal and external procurement processes (Mishra et al.,
2007; Ramkumar et al., 2019; Tatsis et al., 2006). Dozens of e-pro-
curement solutions currently are on the market, and new technologies –
like robotic process automation (RPA) – promise to automate additional
tasks in the e-procurement process (Högel et al., 2018).


Advanced digital technologies include a range of digital technologies
that have emerged more recently, such as cloud computing, the Internet
of Things, additive manufacturing, and big data analytics (Srai and
Lorentz, 2019). As the central interface between internal and external
business partners, procurement is in a unique position to analyze and
use the “big data” that flow between a buying company and its sup-
pliers (Handfield et al., 2019; Kache and Seuring, 2017). Practitioners
expect procurement to tap new sources of value by studying these data
using big data analytics tools (Weise et al., 2018). Examples include
pay-per-use contracting models or artificial intelligence (AI)-based de-
mand and supply forecasting procedures.


Digital procurement practices can encompass both intra- and inter-
organizational SCM practices. The SCPV defines inter-organizational
SCM practices as “a specific activity or a set of activities that spans
different formal organizations and that other supply chain dyads or
networks can imitate” (Carter et al., 2017b, p. 116). The notion of
imitability in the SCPV means that these SCM practices are amenable to
transfer across firms – in contrast to assumptions about inimitable re-
sources in resource-based theory. Conceptually, inter-organizational
SCM practices differ from intra-organizational SCM practices in that
they require mutual efforts from two or more organizations to be ef-
fective (Carter et al., 2017b; Zimmermann and Foerstl, 2014). For ex-
ample, use of real-time spend analytics through mobile apps can be
classified as an intra-organizational practice because it mainly draws on
data residing in the buying firm's internal database. In contrast, e-
procurement can be classified as a dyadic inter-organizational SCM
practice because it relies on bi-directional electronic information ex-
change between buyers and suppliers. In reality, the distinction be-
tween intra- and inter-organizational SCM practices is not always clear-
cut; rather, the continuum can range from the organization to dyads,
triads, and the extended network (Carter et al., 2017b).


Although many digital procurement practices are dyadic in nature,
the SCPV can also be applied to study digital procurement practices in
triads or extended networks – an important shift in that “network
practices … are likely to gain importance for the performance of supply
chains in the future” (Carter et al., 2017b, p. 120). For example, cloud-
based risk analytics might be classified as an inter-organizational net-
work practice because data from multiple external sources is integrated,

such as suppliers' delivery status, external service providers’ weather
data, and news feeds from social media.


The use of inter-organizational digital procurement practices in-
evitably is bound to the willingness and ability of all involved parties to
collaborate and integrate with key partners in the supply chain (Kache
and Seuring, 2017). Therefore, the SCPV, when applied to digital pro-
curement, explicitly takes an inter-organizational perspective that en-
ables us to account for the role of suppliers.


2.3. Digital procurement readiness


Factors affecting the adoption of digital technologies can be located
at different levels of analysis. Extant studies on basic digital procure-
ment technologies (i.e., e-procurement) have begun to explore ante-
cedents to their use at the individual level (e.g., employee-level user
acceptance) (Brandon-Jones and Kauppi, 2018), at the organizational
level (e.g., management support) (Rotchanakitumnuai, 2013), and at
the industry level (e.g., industry traditionalism) (Tatsis et al., 2006). At
the organizational level, PSM researchers emphasize that the keys to
technology use are related to readiness, meaning that a company must
be “ready” – by fulfilling certain prerequisites – if it is to use the
technology (Kros et al., 2011; Ray et al., 2005; Richey et al., 2007). In
the context of our study, we define digital procurement readiness as a
company's ability to embrace and use new digital technologies in pro-
curement (Parasuraman, 2000; Richey et al., 2007).


To conceptualize the dimensions of digital procurement readiness,
we synthesize the dimensions used in extant research (see Table 1). To
structure the factors that potentially influence the use of digital tech-
nologies in procurement, we draw on the technology–organizatio-
n–environment (TOE) framework (Tornatzky and Fleischer, 1990). This
framework divides antecedents that affect the use of new technologies
into three categories: technological, organizational, and environmental.
Prior research has applied the TOE framework to study both the use of
big data analytics in supply chain management (Chen et al., 2016) and
Internet use in procurement (Mishra et al., 2007). Although previous
studies generally have found empirical support for use of the TOE fra-
mework, the specific factors used within each of the three categories
vary across different studies (Chen et al., 2016).


Technological readiness. The literature has identified technological
readiness as a key factor in the adoption decision (Li et al., 2017; Zhu
et al., 2006). Technological readiness refers to a company's “ability to
embrace and use new technological assets” (Richey et al., 2007, p. 195).
Prior studies have demonstrated the importance of technological
readiness in the adoption of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems
(Li et al., 2017), e-business (Zhu et al., 2006), and radio frequency
identification (RFID) technology (Kros et al., 2011). In these cases,
technological readiness comprises two features: 1) the information
technology (IT) infrastructure that enables digital procurement, and 2)
the human resources that possess the knowledge and skills to implement
digital technologies (Venkatesh and Bala, 2012; Zhu et al., 2006).


IT infrastructure refers to information technologies that enable di-
gital procurement practices (Zhu et al., 2006). Because firms differ
significantly in the IT infrastructure available to them, infrastructure
has been identified as one of the main challenges for digital procure-
ment (Kache and Seuring, 2017; Mishra et al., 2007). Information
technologies, such as electronic data interchange (EDI), establish a
platform on which digital procurement practices can be built by en-
abling information transfer within and across firm boundaries (Autry
et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2016; Saldanha et al., 2015). Integrated systems
at the back end, such as an ERP system and a data warehousing system,
provide the “nerve system” for digital procurement by connecting se-
parate systems on common data standards and communication plat-
forms (Dong et al., 2009). A more recent type of IT infrastructure is
cloud computing, which is “a virtualized IT resource and can take the
form of software as a service (SaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS),
and/or platform as a service (PaaS)” (Wu et al., 2013, p. 26). Ta

IT human resources refers to the professionals in an organization who
have the technological knowledge and skills to implement digital pro-
curement technologies (Chen et al., 2016; Turkulainen and Swink,
2017). The influence of skilled IT human resources is critical because
the implementation of advanced digital technologies requires personnel
who have an understanding of both technological and process aspects of
digital procurement (Rotchanakitumnuai, 2013; Venkatesh and Bala,
2012). Many practitioner studies conclude that digital procurement
practices require a very different skill set from procurement managers
(Batran et al., 2017; Pellengahr et al., 2016). New job profiles that call
for a diverse skill set, such as data scientists, are likely to be required for
this transformation of procurement (Schoenherr and Speier-Pero,
2015).


Organizational readiness. Organizational readiness has been identi-
fied as another key factor in the adoption decision (Bakker et al., 2008;
Chen et al., 2016; Sternberg and Norrman, 2017). Organizational
readiness has been defined to mean that the organizational resources
needed for adoption are already available (Iacovou et al., 1995, p. 467).
The term refers to the managerial prerequisites in an organization that
allow it to embrace and use new digital technologies in procurement (Li
et al., 2017). In this study, we include top management support, fi-
nancial resources, and organizational structure as the main indicators of
organizational readiness.


Top management support denotes the degree to which top managers
understand and appreciate the value potential of digital procurement,
as well as the degree to which they champion and promote the use of
digital technologies and practices in procurement (Chen et al., 2016).
The literature widely recognizes that top management support is a
critical enabler for strategic procurement initiatives (Li et al., 2017;
Paulraj et al., 2012) and for IT use in organizations (Li et al., 2017;
Liang et al., 2007; Rotchanakitumnuai, 2013). Top managers can direct
financial and personnel resources toward the procurement function
(Cousins et al., 2006) and can facilitate changes of organizational
norms, values, and cultures (Chen et al., 2016; Li et al., 2017). Likewise,
practitioners emphasize the value of top management support for
driving the digitalization of procurement practices (Batran et al., 2017;
Pellengahr et al., 2016).


Financial resources allow companies to invest in hardware, software,
and system integration and thus represent an important factor for
technology adoption (Zhu et al., 2004). Prior literature suggests that
companies require sufficient financial resources to implement digital
technologies (Chen et al., 2016). The availability of needed financial
resources can be approximated using measures of firm size and profit-
ability.


Organizational structure comprises the roles, responsibilities, and
interfaces for the coordination and integration of digital procurement
both in the company and with external partners. Coordination and in-
tegration can be achieved through vertical mechanisms (e.g., cen-
tralized under a chief digital officer) or through lateral mechanisms
(e.g., decentralized across cross-functional teams). Practitioners em-
phasize that agile teams and dedicated roles (e.g., a digital support
team) can provide a needed organizational resource to enable the
adoption of digital technologies and practices (Schnellbächer et al.,
2018).


Environmental factors. The TOE framework further recognizes that
various environmental factors influence the use of new technologies
(Tornatzky and Fleischer, 1990). Prior studies that have applied the
TOE framework in a supply chain context have acknowledged the
general relevance of suppliers as an environmental factor, but they have
not delved into the actual interplay between buying firms and suppliers
(Mishra et al., 2007). We discuss supplier-side digital readiness as part
of a TOE framework in the next section.


2.4. Supplier-side digital readiness


Because the buyer–supplier dyad is at the core of supply chain


management, we introduce a dyadic perspective that explicitly in-
corporates the supplier as the complementary counterpart to the buying
firm.


Both the TOE framework and the SCPV recognize that firms do not
operate in isolation but are necessarily interacting with external part-
ners in the supply chain (Carter et al., 2017b; Mishra et al., 2007). To
illustrate, in the early phase of e-procurement, General Electric faced
difficulties in implementing e-procurement because a significant pro-
portion of its suppliers was not ready to do business online (Barua et al.,
2004). Because advanced digital procurement is characterized by re-
lationships between companies (Srai and Lorentz, 2019), a company
seeking to implement digital technologies today is likely to be influ-
enced by, if not dependent on, the readiness of its suppliers (Bruque-
Cámara et al., 2016).


Supplier-side digital readiness is defined as the degree to which a
firm's supplier is able to embrace and use digital technologies to engage
in digital interactions with customers (Barua et al., 2004; Richey et al.,
2007). When suppliers have high digitalization levels, firms can use
digital practices across firm boundaries, whereas low digitalization le-
vels can impede efforts to implement inter-organizational digital pro-
curement practices (Agi et al., 2005; Mishra et al., 2007). Lack of
supplier-side digital readiness has repeatedly been shown to inhibit
digitalization efforts in supply chains (Barua et al., 2004; Mishra et al.,
2007; Richey et al., 2007; Wiengarten et al., 2011).


We conceptualize the dimensions of supplier-side digital readiness
as complementary to digital procurement readiness on the buyer side
because the supplier acts as the complementary counterpart to the
buying firm in the adoption of inter-organizational practices. Therefore,
supplier-side digital readiness also encompasses the dimensions of
technological readiness, with its sub-dimensions of IT infrastructure and IT
human resources, and organizational readiness, with the sub-dimensions
of top management support, financial resources, and organizational struc-
ture. To achieve digital complementarity, the supplier should possess
similar or comparable degrees of readiness for implementing digital
technologies across partnering firms and the extended supply chain
(Richey et al., 2007). What complementarity entails for each dimension
and sub-dimension of supplier-side digital readiness plays out differ-
ently, depending on the digital procurement practice in focus. For ex-
ample, providing rapid prototyping services via additive manufacturing
requires a comprehensive IT infrastructure and experienced IT human
resources on the supplier side, while exchanging order information and
tracking of orders via cloud-based e-procurement applications requires
only relatively basic IT infrastructure and IT human resources on the
supplier side.


2.5. Moderating effects


A factor that potentially exerts a key moderating effect on the link
between digital procurement readiness and digital procurement prac-
tices is the relationship type. Extant literature has shown that buyer–-
supplier relationships can be either transactional or collaborative in
nature (e.g., Chicksand et al., 2016; Kaufmann et al., 2018). Transac-
tional relationships are characterized by a relatively basic exchange of
information, products, and services (Heide and John, 1992), and by a
general uncertainty about the continuity and time horizon of future
interaction (Williamson, 2008). Collaborative relationships are char-
acterized by cooperation for mutual gain (Williamson, 2008), a norm of
information exchange (Heide and John, 1992), and trust (Ta et al.,
2018). Trust refers to an exchange partner's expectation that the other
party can be relied on and will act fairly (Poppo et al., 2016; Ta et al.,
2018). The relationship type (i.e., transactional or collaborative) can
moderate the readiness–practice link in two ways. First, the relationship
type can influence the decision about which digital procurement
practices a buying company aims to adopt for a particular buyer–sup-
plier relationship. For example, e-auctions and electronic marketplaces
appear suitable for transactional relationships, whereas the integration


T. Kosmol, et al.






of supply chain partners into an industrial cloud (e.g., for production
planning and inventory management) appears more suitable for colla-
borative relationships. Second, the relationship type can moderate the
adoption process of a selected digital procurement practice because it
influences transaction costs, as well as bilateral coordination and
knowledge exchange (Wang et al., 2016). Moreover, a lack of trust in
the relationship might make firms hesitant to implement technologies
that give higher transparency to their supply chain partner.


According to the TOE framework (Tornatzky and Fleischer, 1990),
the adoption of digital technologies can be further moderated by var-
ious environmental factors, such as the competitive landscape (Chen
et al., 2016) and the institutional context (Bhakoo and Choi, 2013). The
institutional context describes the political, social, and market en-
vironment in which a company is embedded. It encompasses a wide
range of factors, such as data protection regulations, attitudes toward
new technology adoption, IT expertise in the labor force, and Internet
connection speed. In this study, we focus on the institutional context as a
moderator on the readiness–practice link because it has been found to
inhibit the implementation of supply chain technologies in contexts
such as emerging markets (Saldanha et al., 2015).


Furthermore, various factors might exert a moderating or mediating
effect on the link between digital procurement practices and perfor-
mance. For example, Bruque-Cámara et al. (2016) analyzed the po-
tential mediating effects of physical and informational supply chain
integration on the link between community cloud implementation and
operational results. As indicated by the relevant arrow in Fig. 1, digital
procurement readiness also might function as a moderator of the re-
lationship between digital procurement practices and performance. To
illustrate, RFID tracking in the supply chain might influence inventory
costs, and this link might be moderated by the level of the supplier's IT
infrastructure: The more advanced the infrastructure, the more accu-
rately the system will function and the lower the inventory costs can be.


2.6. Performance


The SCPV further emphasizes performance as the dependent vari-
able, rather than sustained competitive advantage, as in the resource-
based or relational view. This emphasis implies that “the SCPV is not
exclusively concerned with explaining the performance of the few
supply chain leaders at the top of an industry, but is mainly interested
in understanding performance variation among the vast majority of the
remaining supply chain dyads or networks” (Carter et al., 2017b, pp.
116–117). Regarding the performance outcomes, the SCPV allows for a
range of intermediate and final dependent variables (Bromiley and Rau,
2016). Intermediate outcomes in digital procurement might be the
cycle time for processing purchase orders or savings on purchase costs,
while a final outcome could be the return on supply management assets
(ROSMA) (Blascovich et al., 2016). Furthermore, the SCPV differ-
entiates between individual and relational performance. Individual
performance results from the use of intra-organizational practices or
from the interaction of intra- and inter-organizational practices (Carter
et al., 2017b). Relational performance refers to “performance benefits
mutually generated by two or more organizations that cannot be gen-
erated by any one of those organizations” (Carter et al., 2017b, p. 116).
Relational performance appears particularly relevant for a PSM context,
where value to a large extent is created along the entire supply chain.


Because of the nascent stage of the field, most studies are only be-
ginning to explore the effects of advanced digital technologies on PSM
(e.g., Durach et al., 2017b; Kache and Seuring, 2017). For example,
Bruque-Cámara et al. (2016) have assessed the effects of cloud com-
puting on operational performance in terms of flexibility and delivery
performance (Bruque-Cámara et al., 2016). Anecdotal evidence in-
dicates that leading companies that use digital technologies – for ex-
ample, IBM Watson's use of artificial intelligence or SAP Ariba's pro-
cure-to-pay solution – have achieved significant performance
improvements in procurement, including more efficient operations, a


smaller carbon footprint, and substantial cost reductions (McGee,
2018).


However, researchers caution that “empirical evidence about the
more advanced forms of practical implementation in PSM is yet to be
collected on a large scale; hence, it is difficult to draw conclusions about
PSM digitalization-related performance associations or even causal-
ities” (Srai and Lorentz, 2019, p. 1). The SCPV can function as a the-
oretical lens to systematically investigate the link between digital
procurement practices and performance; it can help to explain digital
procurement's effects both on individual performance (regarding effi-
ciency and effectiveness) and on the performance of supply chain dyads
or networks. Methodologically, research questions associated with the
performance outcomes of digital procurement practices can most re-
liably be measured via large-N quantitative studies. Because an em-
pirical assessment of the practice–performance link is beyond the scope
of the present study, we join Srai and Lorentz (2019) in their call for
future research to collect large-scale empirical evidence on the perfor-
mance outcomes of digital procurement practices.


In the following, we present the methodology of our empirical case
studies, which focus on the readiness–practice link; the intermediate
outcome we examined is whether the practice had been adopted or not.


3. Methodology


To help answer our first research question of how digital readiness
influences the implementation of digital procurement practices and to
corroborate the findings from the literature review with first empirical
data, we conducted explanatory case studies of buyer–supplier dyads
(Dubois and Salmi, 2016; Ketokivi and Choi, 2014). The dyadic case
studies involve two Western European buying firms and six of their key
suppliers in Europe and China. We have modified the names of these
companies to maintain confidentiality. The unit of analysis is the
buyer–supplier relationship.


3.1. Selection of cases


In selecting cases, we followed the theoretical sampling principle
under which cases are chosen for their potential to illuminate and ex-
tend relationships and logic among constructs (Corbin and Strauss,
2008; Eisenhardt and Graebner, 2007). The selected buying companies,
IndustryCo and AutoseatsCo, represent leaders in their respective in-
dustries. IndustryCo is a true positive outlier (Makino and Chan, 2017)
in the digital transformation of industry, and the Chinese manu-
facturing site selected for this case study is recognized as a model
“digital factory.” China was selected as a particularly information-rich
research context (Dubois and Salmi, 2016) because the Chinese supply
market has high empirical relevance (Kosmol et al., 2018) and is cur-
rently undergoing digital transformation at a very rapid pace. Given
IndustryCo's leading position in digital manufacturing technologies, its
top executives have demonstrated a strong commitment to im-
plementing digital procurement in the firm's Chinese model factory;
they also have shown strong support for this research effort. In-
dustryCo's factory manager explained the overall digitalization
strategy:


With “Made in China (2025),” the Chinese government is really pushing
for Industry 4.0 in order to go away from the cheap factory of the world
to a more advanced factory in China. We as IndustryCo really want to be
a part of this transition. We think with our digitalization that we have
here in our factory, we are clearly one of the most advanced factories in
China. (Factory Manager, IndustryCo).
In line with the theoretical sampling principle, and based on


emergent findings from the IndustryCo cases, we also selected a re-
presentative case to enhance the generalizability of our findings
(Eisenhardt and Graebner, 2007). AutoseatsCo represents the broader
group of companies that struggle in realizing the full potential of digital


T. Kosmol, et al.






procurement. AutoseatsCo is a leading automotive seating manu-
facturer that embraced digital transformation early on by establishing a
Digital Office and by implementing an organization-wide digital
transformation program. However, the company has faced challenges in
implementing its ambitious roadmap for digital procurement.


A high ratio of purchasing spend to sales indicates that both
IndustryCo and AutoseatsCo depend greatly on their supply base.
Consequently, suppliers play a critical role in enabling the success of
these companies. Following the theoretical sampling principle, we se-
lected the six key suppliers for the case studies to enhance external
validity and generalizability (Eisenhardt and Graebner, 2007;
Flyvbjerg, 2006). We asked a senior procurement manager at each
buying firm to identify key suppliers with which the company had ei-
ther successfully implemented digitalization projects or encountered
difficulties in implementing digitalization projects (i.e., to identify
polar cases) (Eisenhardt and Graebner, 2007). Therefore, the selection
criterion for the polar cases was whether the practice had been adopted
at all, and not what the performance outcomes of the digital procure-
ment practice were. IndustryCo provided two positive cases and two
negative cases regarding the adoption or use of digital procurement
practices, and AutoseatsCo provided one positive case and one negative
case. Table 2 provides summary information on these six dyadic re-
lationships and the companies involved.


3.2. Data collection


Data were collected through 18 in-depth, semi-structured interviews
with IndustryCo, AutoseatsCo, and the suppliers, supplemented by
documents and onsite visits. Our semi-structured interviews ranged
from 20 to 195min in duration, with an average of 67min, and they
were conducted face-to-face, except for three phone interviews. The
interviews were carried out in English or Chinese, depending on the
interviewee's preference. All interviews were recorded and transcribed
verbatim or were translated as necessary (i.e., from Chinese to English).
The informants in the buying firms represented multiple functions and
levels of management to ensure construct validity through triangulation
(Jick, 1979; Stuart et al., 2002). Their titles included factory manager,
head of strategic procurement, operational purchaser, and IT manager.
Informant job titles at the suppliers included general manager or key
account manager. Appendix B provides further details on the in-
formants.


The semi-structured interview guideline (see Appendix C) was de-
veloped from the extant literature on digital procurement and included
open-ended questions to enable managers to describe events and pro-
cesses. It included questions about the organization and digitalization
strategy, digitalization initiatives, and barriers to and enablers of di-
gitalization. To complement the interview data and obtain a more
complete understanding of the suppliers’ digital readiness, we toured


their production facilities; we also participated in demonstrations of the
digital technologies used at IndustryCo and two of its suppliers. In
addition, we collected both publicly available documents (e.g., industry
reports and annual reports) and company-internal documents (e.g.,
project presentations and status reports) from the case companies for
the purpose of data triangulation (Pettigrew, 1990).


3.3. Data analysis


For the within-case analysis, we constructed case study reports for
each buyer–supplier dyad to extract a rich picture of the digital readi-
ness of the respective firms, as well as barriers and enablers en-
countered during digitalization initiatives. In the case study reports, we
used citations from interviews, photos, and other collected documents
to stay close to the original data and to achieve high levels of accuracy
(Yin, 2014). To ensure the reliability of our data, we asked the key
informants to review the drafts of our case study reports. We then began
the within-case analysis of each buyer–supplier dyad, the unit of ana-
lysis; we searched for emerging themes and developed a rough theo-
retical explanation for the adoption of digital procurement practices
that fit each dyad. For example, top management support was a concept
that emerged in this analysis phase.


For the cross-case analysis, the findings from the within-case ana-
lyses were compared to identify similarities and differences among the
six dyadic cases (Eisenhardt, 1989; Miles et al., 2013). We coded the
cases into constructs that emerged through the comparisons and used
this data to develop a series of tables and graphs (Miles et al., 2013). We
also compared and contrasted the emerging empirical patterns with the
extant literature on digital procurement to further enhance internal and
external validity (Gibbert et al., 2008). In the next section, we syn-
thesize our findings on digital procurement readiness from the within-
case analysis.


4. Within-case analysis


4.1. IndustryCo


The selected manufacturing site of IndustryCo, a global industrial
company, is a state-of-the-art model factory for industrial automation
products in China. Despite the high level of automation within its own
factory, IndustryCo still had a long way to go to fully establish a digi-
tally integrated supply chain. To automate the purchase-to-pay process,
IndustryCo had implemented e-procurement software and was in the
process of establishing either classic electronic data interchange (EDI)
or WebEDI integration with several of its key suppliers in China, thus
enabling an end-to-end digital supply chain.


We must make sure that the information from our customers goes

through the whole supply chain quickly, and in real time. It must be a
very efficient information transfer if we want to make sure that our whole
supply chain responds very quickly. We expect suppliers to have the
capability and willingness to cooperate with us—for example, on EDI
solutions, the forecast, VMI [vendor-managed inventory]. All these tools
aim to make sure that all the information from our customers to our
supply chain can move very fast. (Head of Strategic Procurement,
IndustryCo).
Although IndustryCo followed an ambitious road map for estab-


lishing EDI with most of its suppliers, this project remained a work-in-
progress for many of the supplier relationships and constituted one of
the largest digitalization projects in the procurement department. As we
explain, the difficulties that IndustryCo faced in implementing digital
practices with its suppliers, despite its own advanced abilities, well il-
lustrate the importance of a dyadic perspective on digital procurement
readiness.


Analyzing IndustryCo through the perspective of the SCPV, we
found that the firm's organizational readiness was high. IndustryCo's
factory manager emphasized the strategic importance of digitalizing its
supply chain relationships: “Procurement is clearly playing an important
role [in the digital transformation of IndustryCo] by bringing digitalization
to the suppliers” (Factory Manager, IndustryCo). Similarly, the Head of
Strategic Procurement stressed the strong top management support for
digital integration with its suppliers:


At IndustryCo, we have high attention, on the one hand, to drive our-
selves to use the digitalization tools—for example, data exchange be-
tween us and the supplier. We also, on the other hand, encourage our
suppliers to invest in these digitalization solutions to make sure that the
two companies can exchange information very quickly. In general, our
procurement strategy for digitalization is trying to digitalize the manual
work and make sure that the information is more efficient. This is the
direction we want to drive by using a lot of tools, internally and ex-
ternally. (Head of Strategic Procurement, IndustryCo).
In terms of financial resources, IndustryCo was in a strong financial


position to invest in digitalization. The large industrial company – listed
on the stock exchange – had a very good credit rating, and the selected
manufacturing site earned high BIT margins over the previous two
years. Regarding organizational structure, IndustryCo had installed a
chief digital officer at the business unit level and was planning to es-
tablish a dedicated responsibility for digitalization in the procurement
function:


During a town hall meeting, we recently discussed what we understand by
digitalization.… We are now planning to have a procurement employee
who dedicates part of her work time to digitalization and who can co-
ordinate digitalization initiatives in procurement. (Head of Operational
Purchasing, IndustryCo, follow-up call).
The technological readiness of IndustryCo can be categorized as high


as well. In terms of IT infrastructure, IndustryCo used a globally in-
tegrated ERP system and a company-wide data warehouse that pro-
vided transparency on supplier data. Furthermore, IndustryCo em-
ployed sophisticated IT experts and dedicated teams that constantly
upgraded digital procurement technologies on both the corporate level
and the plant level, including EDI. From the perspective of the IT
Manager at IndustryCo's Chinese plant, EDI represents “a standard
technology that has been around for a long time” (IT Manager,
IndustryCo), even though many Chinese suppliers encountered diffi-
culties in implementing this technology.


4.2. Supply relationship between IndustryCo and Electronics-SPL (negative
case)


Electronics-SPL has been IndustryCo's main supplier of printed cir-
cuit boards (PCBs) in China for several years, accounting for the


majority of spend in this strategically important purchase category. In
turn, Electronics-SPL viewed IndustryCo as a strategic partner and
ranked it among its top five customers globally. The buyer–supplier
relationship can be characterized as collaborative, which implies that
IndustryCo had targeted a deeper digital integration with Electronics-
SPL. In 2014 both companies had initiated a joint project to implement
EDI for streamlining the order process. However, during the im-
plementation process, the companies encountered problems with the
data exchange (e.g., wrongly duplicated purchase orders and difficul-
ties in making order changes), so that they stopped using the EDI link.
Although this negative event certainly reduced both companies' moti-
vation to tackle the EDI implementation, we found a key underlying
root cause of the implementation challenges was Electronics-SPL's low
to medium level of digital procurement readiness.


The Operational Purchaser described Electronics-SPL as “a very
professional supplier” that “knows the benefits of EDI” and that was willing
to adopt the technology. As a medium-sized company that had earned
strong EBIT margins over the previous two years, Electronics-SPL also
had sufficient financial resources to invest in digitalization. However,
the supplier lacked the support from top management that was required
to successfully implement this digital technology. Electronics-SPL's Key
Account Manager explained:


Why is our attention toward IT not developed? This depends on where the
boss puts his emphasis with regards to the company's development. For
example, because labor costs might be too cheap, the boss does not want
to invest a lot of money in an IT system. So this concept of EDI first needs
to get into the heart of the boss. (Key Account Manager, Electronics-
SPL).
In terms of technological readiness, Electronics-SPL can be categor-


ized as low. The supplier used an ERP system that had been developed
in-house, rather than buying one from an external provider “because up
to now our boss has been more focused on the sales products” (Key Account
Manager, Electronics-SPL). This homegrown ERP system showed poor
compatibility with external interfaces, which meant that IndustryCo
was linked to Electronics-SPL via a third-party EDI platform rather than
directly. Furthermore, Electronics-SPL had to export the daily order
information from the third-party platform using Excel and then
manually transfer it to its ERP system because the system had no Excel
upload functionality. This lack of an adequate IT infrastructure severely
impeded the implementation of EDI, as IndustryCo's Operational
Purchaser described:


For EDI, most importantly, the supplier first needs to possess the ERP
system himself. If the supplier himself does not possess a system that
allows for EDI, there is no way to implement EDI. The supplier needs to
be system-ready. (Operational Purchaser, IndustryCo).
In addition to the poor IT infrastructure, a lack of skilled IT human


resources at Electronics-SPL hampered the implementation of EDI, as
the Key Account Manager explained:


EDI requires quite grown-up IT engineering skills, it needs a very grown-
up technology team. It depends on the company's degree of attention
towards IT. So if our IT department is not so developed, the risks asso-
ciated with EDI can be very big. If they do not understand the EDI system,
this can turn into a disaster. (Key Account Manager, Electronics-SPL).
As a consequence, Electronics-SPL represented a clear bottleneck for


IndustryCo's efforts to establish a digitally integrated supply chain.
Because the supply chain partners had to revert to exchanging order
data via email, they were not able to realize joint improvements in
efficiency:


With the current solution via email, we need to spend more time. We
would wish that we can use EDI with IndustryCo. This would increase
efficiency. (Key Account Manager, Electronics-SPL).

4.3. Supply relationship between IndustryCo and Packaging-SPL (negative
case)


Packaging-SPL was a small manufacturer of cardboard boxes that
accounted for the majority of IndustryCo's purchase volume in this
category, and IndustryCo was the number one customer for Packaging-
SPL. Given the relatively basic exchange of products and the fact that
the supplier could be replaced relatively easily, the buyer–supplier re-
lationship is characterized as transactional. The transactional nature of
the relationship implied that IndustryCo primarily aimed to implement
digital procurement practices that would reduce the transaction costs
through more efficient information transfer. To reduce the lead time
and inventory for cardboard boxes, IndustryCo shared the daily pro-
duction forecast with Packaging-SPL via an Internet platform. However,
purchase orders still were transferred to Packaging-SPL via email in an
Excel file because the supplier balked at the adoption of IndustryCo's
WebEDI solution.


The organizational readiness of Packaging-SPL is categorized as low.
The site visit revealed that this small, privately owned supplier so far
had only a basic organizational structure and simple operational pro-
cesses in place. Although no financial data was available for Packaging-
SPL, the on-site visit revealed a high degree of manual processing in
production and only very limited investments in machinery. Compared
with other packaging suppliers in the industry, these findings indicated
that Packaging-SPL had only limited financial resources and operated
on relatively low profit margins. Although Packaging-SPL's manager
showed “strong willingness to cooperate” (Operational Purchaser,
IndustryCo) with IndustryCo on the solution for accessing the daily
production forecast via the Internet platform, it was not yet willing to
adopt the WebEDI solution to exchange order data. According to
IndustryCo's Operational Purchaser, this WebEDI solution was not
viewed as beneficial by the supplier because it required additional
manual data processing on the supplier's side.


The technological readiness of Packaging-SPL also is categorized as
low. According to IndustryCo's Operational Purchaser, the supplier's “IT
support is very poor,” which impeded the joint implementation of digital
technologies like EDI:


The reason why we did not implement EDI [with Packaging-SPL] lies
mainly at the supplier side because its employees cannot handle our data
very efficiently if we send the EDI data to them. So we would have to
teach them how to understand our EDI data. They replied to us that they
hoped to choose the traditional method to handle our purchase orders, by
Excel and by email communication. (Operational Purchaser,
IndustryCo).
Because of Packaging-SPL's low technological readiness, the


WebEDI solution could not be successfully implemented, and the order
data were still exchanged via phone and email. Internal status pre-
sentations from IndustryCo showed that poor “supplier EDI capability”
and insufficient “supplier IT resources” posed a serious constraint to
realizing IndustryCo's road map for establishing comprehensive EDI. As
a consequence, the roadmap needed to be “adjusted to the business en-
vironment” (internal company presentation) in the Chinese supply
market, and the implementation of more advanced digital procurement
technologies had to be postponed.


4.4. Supply relationship between IndustryCo and Plastics-SPL (positive
case)


Plastics-SPL is a manufacturer of plastic injection parts that had
been working with IndustryCo for about two years. Although
IndustryCo's current order volumes were still low, the supplier showed
“a strong desire” to expand its business with IndustryCo (Operational
Purchaser, IndustryCo). Because some uncertainty about the future
trajectory of the business remained, the current buyer–supplier re-
lationship was characterized as transactional. Nevertheless, both


companies were willing to take a ‘leap of faith’ (Chicksand et al., 2016)
and aimed for a deeper digital integration to move toward a colla-
borative relationship. Plastics-SPL did not even have an ERP system
until 2016, but IndustryCo's implementation of the WebEDI solution
with Plastics-SPL went very smoothly and had significantly reduced
IndustryCo's workload for purchase orders.


The organizational readiness of Plastics-SPL was categorized as
medium to high. Plastics-SPL described itself as a modern enterprise
with a focus on “constant innovation” for “the Industry 4.0 era.” The
onsite visit revealed that Plastics-SPL had recently invested in a new
production facility and modern manufacturing equipment. This in-
vestment suggested to us that the financial resources of Plastics-SPL
could be categorized as medium, despite its relatively small size of 250
employees and revenues of 20 million Euros. IndustryCo's Operational
Purchaser explained that Plastics-SPL's “internal management processes
are very good” and that a dedicated order management team facilitated
the adoption of the WebEDI solution. A key factor for the successful
implementation of WebEDI was the willingness of Plastics-SPL's top
management to strengthen the business relationship with IndustryCo:


We are a digital factory; we require suppliers to use EDI. We also con-
sider this when we assign future orders.… Plastics-SPL is a new supplier
that has a strong willingness to do business with us, so it is easier to
implement EDI with this supplier compared with other suppliers.
(Operational Purchaser, IndustryCo).
The technological readiness of Plastics-SPL also can be categorized as


medium. In terms of IT infrastructure, Plastics-SPL had recently in-
troduced an ERP system from an Asian software provider that allowed
for the internal processing of order data, but it impeded the external
integration with IndustryCo's WebEDI solution.


It is a very specialized ERP system in the molding industry. The external
interfaces are not quite the same, so there is no way to directly interface
with IndustryCo. […] When implementing WebEDI, we had a lot of
communication with IndustryCo, but we could not manage to directly
transfer an order to our ERP system. (Marketing Director, Plastics-
SPL).
Despite the initial interface problems, Plastics-SPL acquired the


necessary technological knowledge and skills to implement the WebEDI
solution. Plastics-SPL's WebEDI experience with other customers was
especially helpful in facilitating the adoption:


What was very good was that the supplier already had experience with
WebEDI. They already had this experience from other customers and
were very willing to do it this way with IndustryCo. (Operational
Purchaser, IndustryCo).


4.5. Supply relationship between IndustryCo and Semicon-SPL (positive
case)


Semicon-SPL is a global manufacturer of semiconductors. The firm
ranked among IndustryCo's top three suppliers. IndustryCo accounted
for only a small share of Semicon-SPL's revenues, but it was valued as a
key customer because of its leading role in the digital transformation of
industry. The relationship between Semicon-SPL and IndustryCo was
based on “mutual trust” (Key Account Manager, Semicon-SPL), and we
characterized it as collaborative. Both parties saw a deep digital in-
tegration as a means for joint improvements and as a natural trajectory
in this buyer–supplier relationship.


The organizational readiness of Semicon-SPL was categorized as high.
Semicon-SPL described itself as an “advocate of Industry 4.0” and was
committed to driving digitalization (Key Account Manager, Semicon-
SPL). The Key Account Manager explained that Semicon-SPL required
its business partners – and especially key customers such as IndustryCo
– to implement EDI to reduce the workload:


T. Kosmol, et al.






We have a lot of business with IndustryCo worldwide so far. We will have
more and more business with IndustryCo and grow with IndustryCo, so
this is the reason why we implemented the EDI: to facilitate the pro-
curement and manufacturing. (Key Account Manager, Semicon-SPL).
As a stock-listed company, Semicon-SPL had ample financial re-


sources to invest in digitalization; it had good credit ratings and very
high two-digit EBIT margins over the past two years. Furthermore,
Semicon-SPL maintained a dedicated team in the IT department that
was responsible for the implementation of digital technologies with its
business partners, and this team facilitated the implementation of EDI
with IndustryCo.


The technological readiness of Semicon-SPL also was categorized as
high. Semicon-SPL used the same ERP system as IndustryCo, which was
viewed as an enabler for the EDI implementation because it largely
eliminated interface problems. Although Semicon-SPL's IT resources
were in high demand, the company had sufficient experience in EDI
implementation and had access to highly qualified IT experts.


Semicon-SPL already started using EDI technology very early, so they
probably understand this technology quite well. (Operational
Purchaser, IndustryCo).
Semicon's Key Account Manager also emphasized the critical role


that IT human resources played in the successful implementation of
EDI:


I think the EDI implementation is dependent on the IT team's capability. If
the IT is very genius and does not have an issue with the different ERP
systems, then the implementation is quite fast, smooth, and safe and
stable. (Key Account Manager, Semicon-SPL).


4.6. AutoseatsCo


AutoseatsCo is a global automotive seating manufacturer. It has
pursued several digitalization initiatives in procurement across its sites.
For example, to replace its legacy solutions, it has begun rolling out an
e-procurement suite that includes functionalities such as e-RfX, e-
Auctions, catalog buying, and contract management. Furthermore,
AutoseatsCo was in the process of implementing an advanced digital
should-cost tool to replace conventional cost breakdowns and to ana-
lyze a purchase item's underlying cost structure. “Our should-cost tool
calculates the cost for the ‘perfect plant,’ and then we compare this with the
costs of our suppliers. […] Then we see where the gaps are, and we try to
close these gaps in a joint project” (Manager Purchasing Process,
AutoseatsCo). Our analysis focused on the implementation of this ad-
vanced digital should-cost tool because AutoseatsCo repeatedly em-
phasized the uniqueness of this solution; and yet, the challenges in the
implementation process were representative of its digitalization efforts.


Applying the analytical lens of the SCPV, we ranked the organiza-
tional readiness of AutoseatsCo as medium to high. The leadership team
showed “unwavering support” for digital procurement and was pursuing
an ambitious roadmap for digital procurement. Still, AutoseatsCo
lacked the needed financial resources for implementing digital tech-
nologies throughout the organization:


We have a strategy, a five-year plan. But I am not sure if we can realize
this plan because we have a problem with the budget. (Manager
Purchasing Process, AutoseatsCo).
AutoseatsCo's tight financial resources were reflected in low and


even negative EBIT margins during the past two years. Regarding the
rollout of an integrated ERP system, the Director Supplier Risk
Management also emphasized the financial constraints:


We have this rollout plan, but this would have to be backed with real
money. But since you have to show the stock market how profitable the
company is, no money will be released. (Director Supplier Risk


Management, AutoseatsCo).
Although AutoseatsCo had established a Digital Office at the cor-


porate level, no dedicated position for digital procurement existed yet.
Instead, AutoseatsCo was using cross-functional project teams to run
digitalization projects, such as the rollout of the new e-procurement
suite.


The technological readiness of AutoseatsCo was set at medium to high
as well. Establishing an integrated ERP system was the main challenge.
Because the company had grown through acquisitions, the IT infra-
structure comprised several ERP systems that lacked integration.


We have over twenty different ERP systems in use that don't talk to each
other. […] Before we talk about digitalization, maybe we should get a
reasonable SAP rollout done. […] We have approaches for digital pro-
curement, but we lack the infrastructure on our side. (Director Supplier
Risk Management, AutoseatsCo).
The rather fragmented ERP system landscape resulted in additional


manual data processing efforts, limited the transparency of supplier
data, and complicated the rollout of digital technologies, such as the
new e-procurement suite. Regarding IT human resources, the Manager
Purchasing Process noted that “people with deep knowledge are key for
digital procurement” and that AutoseatsCo had great SAP experts on its
team for the rollout of the new e-procurement suite. The high potential
of the company's human resources currently seemed to be held back by
the issues in funding and organizational structure.


4.7. Supply relationship between AutoseatsCo and Fasteners-SPL (negative
case)


Fasteners-SPL is a medium-sized supplier of nuts and bolts for the
automotive industry and represented a C-supplier for AutoseatsCo.
From the supplier's perspective, though, AutoseatsCo was Fastener-
SPL's number one customer. Based on the relatively basic exchange of
products and a perceived lack of trust, the buyer–supplier relationship
was characterized as transactional.


The organizational readiness of Fasteners-SPL was categorized as low.
The medium-sized company's ability to invest in digitalization was
constrained by limited financial resources and low EBIT margins.
AutoseatsCo had been preparing for more than a year to implement its
advanced digital should-cost tool with Fasteners-SPL, but the im-
plementation was delayed because the supplier was not interested in
adopting this digital technology.


We are not interested in this should-cost tool because it is only suitable
for simple parts, and we are specialized on complex parts. It would be
perfect for us if AutoseatsCo does not implement this system.
(Commercial Manager, Fasteners-SPL).
The supplier was worried that the price benchmark comparisons


were not applicable to its cost structure and that the advanced digital
should-cost tool would be used by AutoseatsCo to negotiate lower
prices. AutoseatsCo's Manager Purchasing Process acknowledged that
the higher transparency through the should-cost tool might reduce the
supplier's margins, but he also emphasized the benefits for the supplier,
in that “using the should-cost tool is an advantage for receiving contracts.”


The technological readiness of Fasteners-SPL was evaluated as low to
medium. Fastener-SPL's Commercial Manager stated that its IT systems
already fulfill the requirements of its customers and that Fasteners-SPL
possessed sufficient IT expertise. As AutoseatsCo's Manager Purchasing
Process acknowledged, the factor that restrained the firm's im-
plementation of the advanced digital should-cost tool was not techno-
logical but organizational:


Some suppliers do not like to implement the should-cost tool because they
have to show us everything. (Manager Purchasing Process,
AutoseatsCo).


T. Kosmol, et al.






4.8. Supply relationship between AutoseatsCo and Stampings-SPL (positive
case)


Stampings-SPL manufactures precision stamped parts across several
locations in Europe. AutoseatsCo was among its most important cus-
tomers, while Stampings-SPL represented a B-supplier to AutoseatsCo.
The buyer–supplier relationship was characterized as transactional be-
cause the supplied products were relatively basic and the supplier
switching costs comparatively low. Both companies successfully im-
plemented the advanced digital should-cost tool about one year ago.
Stampings-SPL's Senior Commercial Manager viewed “a basis of trust as
a prerequisite” for the implementation, especially because the tool of-
fered no transparency showing how its complex algorithms calculated
the benchmark prices. As a result of the implementation, Stampings-SPL
committed to significant price reductions for its current products and
agreed on a lower cost basis for future products, but it also strengthened
its position as a preferred supplier.


The organizational readiness of Stampings-SPL was categorized as
medium. With revenues of 250 million Euros and high single-digit but
decreasing EBIT margins, Stampings-SPL's financial resources for in-
vesting in digitalization was categorized as medium. The Senior
Commercial Manager stated that Stampings-SPL does not proactively
invest in digitalization but needs to “keep up with the requirements of the
customers” (Senior Commercial Manager, Stampings-SPL). To keep pace
with increasing customer demands, the supplier's top management
regularly invested in advanced manufacturing technology:


“Growth doesn't come with backward-thinking manufacturing techniques
or methods.” (Managing Director, Stampings-SPL).


Because AutoseatsCo was one of its most important customers,
Stampings-SPL decided to implement the advanced digital should-cost
tool, although its Senior Commercial Manager recognized that the in-
creased transparency mainly served the customer's interest:


Basically, we were open to the introduction of the should-cost tool. On
the one hand, the should-cost tool enables us to work transparently with
AutoseatsCo. […] That the customer requires transparency is a com-
pletely normal process in the automotive industry. […] On the other
hand, we know that the customer has a certain expectation and that
behind the should-cost tool is a cost-cutting program. (Senior
Commercial Manager, Stampings-SPL).
A key prerequisite for the successful implementation of the ad-


vanced digital should-cost tool was that the supplier could assert its
commercial interests in the negotiations during the implementation
process:


We have been negotiating the input parameters into the should-cost tool
for a very long time. […] We had to make sure that what came out of the
should-cost tool in the end was comprehensible to us and that the prices
were acceptable for the future. (Senior Commercial Manager,
Stampings-SPL).
The technological readiness of Stampings-SPL was categorized as low.


After Stampings-SPL's acquisition two years ago, the IT infrastructure of


the newly combined companies had not yet been integrated. Although
an internal IT department managed the IT infrastructure at Stamping-
SPL headquarters, the IT function of the acquired company was out-
sourced to an external service provider. The Senior Commercial
Manager explained that the IT infrastructure of Stampings-SPL was
outdated, noting that its IT equipment had to be upgraded with larger
storage to implement the should-cost tool.


Our IT is not very advanced because we have always managed to get by
with the available [systems]. Other suppliers are certainly better in this
regard. (Senior Commercial Manager, Stampings-SPL).
However, because the advanced digital should-cost tool did not


place high technology requirements on the supplier, the current level of
IT infrastructure was sufficient to implement the tool. This case illus-
trates particularly well the importance of the dyadic perspective of
digital procurement readiness: A fit between the aspirations and abil-
ities of the buying firm and the supplier is a prerequisite for successful
implementation of digital procurement practices.


5. Cross-case analysis


The within-case analysis discussed in the previous section looks at
the digital readiness within each dyad. Here, we conduct our analysis
across the six buyer–supplier dyads, based on the case analysis shown in
Table 3 and Table 4. Our goal is to gain an in-depth understanding of
the interplay of buyers and suppliers in the implementation of digital
technologies.


We first synthesize overarching patterns of digital readiness across
the eight case companies before exploring dynamic change processes in
the discussion section. The first general finding pertains to the firms’
use of only relatively mature digital technologies. The case companies had
implemented only basic digital technologies at the time of data col-
lection, despite their leading industry positions and ambitious digita-
lization roadmaps. We did not find evidence that advanced digital
technologies (e.g., big data analytics, blockchain) were being im-
plemented at the case companies, which again suggests that the vast
majority of firms still have a long way to go on their digitalization
journey. Bottlenecks on the supplier side might be one factor that
hinders buying firms from implementing more advanced inter-organi-
zational digital procurement practices.


The results of the within-case analysis empirically support the the-
oretically derived dimensions and sub-dimensions of digital

procurement readiness as relevant factors for explaining the adoption of
digital technologies in procurement. High organizational readiness seems
to play an enabling role for the adoption of digital technologies, al-
though the causal mechanisms at play might differ for each of the sub-
dimensions: top management support, financial resources, and organi-
zational structure. Financial resources seem to be a necessary but not
sufficient condition for companies to embrace new digital technologies
in procurement. In the case of AutoseatsCo, tight financial resources
constrained the implementation of the company's digitalization
roadmap, while in the case of Electronics-SPL, sufficient financial re-
sources alone did not result in the successful adoption of digital tech-
nologies. The cases suggest that top management support and organi-
zational structure are needed as critical ingredients for the adoption of
digital technologies. Meanwhile, low technological readiness seems to
impede the adoption of digital technologies; low levels of both IT in-
frastructure and IT human resources were associated with unsuccessful
technology adoption in the negative cases of Electronics-SPL,
Packaging-SPL, and Fasteners-SPL. For example, in the case of
Packaging-SPL, the employees displayed less than adequate technology
competencies for dealing with the EDI technology.


Analyzing the moderating role of the institutional context – that is,
whether the buyer–supplier relationship is embedded in an emerging or
developed market context – provides interesting insights. Especially in
the institutional context in which IndustryCo's Chinese manufacturing
site operates, the fragmented ERP landscape presented a barrier to di-
gital integration with suppliers. As such, our findings provide support
for the relevance of the environmental dimension of the TOE framework.
The interoperability of ERP systems was cited as a barrier for all three
cases where IndustryCo cooperated with local Chinese suppliers
(Electronics-SPL, Packaging-SPL, Plastics-SPL), reflecting the challenges
presented by the fragmented ERP landscape in China (Li et al., 2017). A
comparison of EDI implementation ratios between IndustryCo's Chinese
manufacturing site and its almost identical sister plant in Western
Europe underscores the strong influence of the institutional context:
IndustryCo's Western European plant had achieved 100% EDI integra-
tion with its suppliers, but IndustryCo's Chinese plant had reached only
47% EDI coverage (based on purchase volume) at the time of data
collection. An internal presentation of IndustryCo's Chinese manu-
facturing site stated that “the [EDI implementation] road map is adjusted
to the business environment.” Therefore, we propose that the institutional
context moderates the link between digital procurement readiness and
digital procurement practices.


The cross-case analysis on the moderating role of relationship type –
that is, whether the buyer–supplier relationship is more transactional or
collaborative in nature – does not suggest that the relationship type in
itself has a universal moderating effect. Of the two negative cases in-
volving IndustryCo (Electronics-SPL, Packaging-SPL), one had a colla-
borative relationship and one a transactional one; the same holds for
the two positive cases (Plastics-SPL, Semicon-SPL). Similarly, the two
AutoseatsCo cases (Fasteners-SPL, Stampings-SPL) both involve trans-
actional relationships but are associated with negative and positive
technology adoption. One explanation as to why the relationship type
did not seem to moderate the implementation process more strongly
could be that the formal relationship type, transactional vs. collabora-
tive, is overshadowed by the specific role of trust in the relationship. In
the Fasteners-SPL case, the lack of trust noticeably impeded the adop-
tion of the advanced digital should-cost tool, suggesting a negative
moderating effect of relationship type on the readiness–practice link.
Similarly, in the Semicon-SPL case, mutual trust enabled the EDI im-
plementation, suggesting a positive moderating effect of relationship
trust on the readiness–practice link. Therefore, we propose that trust
exerts a moderating effect on the adoption of digital procurement
practices, particularly when a deeper level of digital integration is
targeted.


The results of the within-case analysis also point to the importance
of both organizational readiness and technological readiness in


combination. Technological readiness inhibited the adoption of digital
technologies, despite sufficient organizational readiness, in the case of
Electronics-SPL; meanwhile, low organizational readiness appeared to
be the constraining factor in the case of Fasteners-SPL. This finding
implies that companies need to have a certain level of both organiza-
tional readiness and technological readiness to successfully implement
digital technologies.


Our empirical findings further suggest that the required level of the
supplier's digital readiness depends on the technological sophistication
that a digital procurement practice requires from the buyer and/or the
supplier. Although the examined cases involve basic digital technolo-
gies that require relatively low levels of technological sophistication,
the three negative cases demonstrate that a certain level of digital
readiness nevertheless is needed for successful technology adoption.
Analyzing the adoption patterns of digital technologies through the
SCPV, we can see that the digital procurement practice of EDI, de-
scribed in the IndustryCo cases, requires a higher level of digital
readiness from the supplier side; meanwhile, digital readiness needs are
lower for suppliers in the case of the advanced digital should-cost tool,
analyzed in the AutoseatsCo cases. This finding implies that researchers
should assess the degree of technological readiness in relation to the
technological sophistication that a digital procurement practice imposes
on or requires from the buyer and the supplier. We suggest that a digital
procurement practice with a higher degree of technological sophisti-
cation requires a higher level of technological readiness.


Importantly, the findings from the case studies also reveal that the
digital transformation of procurement at both IndustryCo and
AutoseatsCo was at least partly impeded by the digital readiness level of
their suppliers. IndustryCo's Head of Strategic Procurement explained
that the heterogeneity of the supply base represented a challenge for
digitalization:


Our supply base is quite varied; our suppliers are not all on the same
level. We have world-class suppliers like Semicon-SPL. We do not need to
teach these companies about digitalization. All you need to do with these
world-class suppliers is to coordinate, discuss, find a win–win situation,
and align which tools to implement and what kind of information to
share. For the middle-sized and the low-end suppliers, we also need to
promote digitalization, to educate them on its benefits for them. (Head of
Strategic Procurement, IndustryCo).
Interestingly, the variation across our nested case studies can best be


explained by looking at both the buyer side and the supplier side. When
digital procurement readiness is held constant for each buying firm, the
differences between successful and unsuccessful implementation seem
rooted in varying levels of digital readiness on the supplier side. In the
nested cases of IndustryCo, successful implementation is associated
with medium (Plastics-SPL) and high (Semicon-SPL) levels of digital
readiness on the supplier side. In turn, unsuccessful implementation is
associated with low (Packaging-SPL) and low-medium (Electronics-
SPL) levels of digital readiness on the supplier side. In the nested cases
of AutoseatsCo, successful implementation is associated with low-
medium (Stampings-SPL) digital readiness on the supplier side, whereas
unsuccessful implementation is associated with low (Fasteners-SPL)
digital readiness on the supplier side. This clear pattern proposes that
digital readiness on the supplier side is a key explanatory variable for
the adoption of digital procurement practices.


The digital readiness matrix shown in Fig. 2 illustrates how com-
bining the buyer-side and supplier-side perspectives results in a clearer
picture of the alignments and misalignments for each dyad.


Fig. 2 shows the buyer's digital procurement readiness on the X-axis
and the supplier's digital readiness on the Y-axis. The digital readiness
matrix proposes that digital procurement practices can only be suc-
cessfully implemented if both buyer and supplier show a certain level of
digital readiness. Although a relatively higher level of digital readiness
in a supply chain partner is not disadvantageous, our cases point to the
likelihood that when a supply chain partner has a lower level of digital


T. Kosmol, et al.






readiness, it typically creates a bottleneck for the implementation of
digital procurement practices. Attempts by buying firms to implement
inter-organizational digital procurement practices therefore are more
likely to fail if suppliers are not ready to follow on the digital trans-
formation journey. Leading suppliers trying to implement advanced
technologies with laggard buying firms are also likely to face the same
challenge.


For example, IndustryCo's management recognized that digitaliza-
tion could not stop at the factory walls; the firm needed to synchronize
with its suppliers to deliver digitalization's full benefits. The Factory
Manager explained:


If you really want to digitalize, clearly also the entire supply chain has to
follow the same way. It is not working if only we are digitalized but then
there is a break with our suppliers. From my point of view, the supply
base also has to upgrade to the same level.… Clearly, procurement is
playing one of the important roles in … really bringing digitalization to
the suppliers in the next years. (Factory Manager, IndustryCo).


6. Practice–performance link


Our empirical cases focused on the readiness–practice link, and the
intermediate outcome we examined was whether the practice had been
adopted or not. This study thus measured adoption in a binary way;
however, we can also conceive of future studies that take more gradual
measures of practice use, such as the adoption rate across a supplier
portfolio or use as a percentage of transactions. Although the practi-
ce–performance link was not the focus of the present study, we now
briefly discuss the observed performance outcomes.


The first tentative finding pertains to the absence of systematic and
specific performance measurements for the effects of digital procurement


practices at our case companies. None of the interviewees reported that
their company tracked any performance indicators to specifically
evaluate the effects of digital procurement practices. This finding ap-
parently reflects a wider phenomenon in industry. A recent conference
paper on digital procurement also finds that “neither literature, nor the
company considered offer any performance indicators for measuring
digital initiatives” (Elsaesser et al., 2019, p. 15). To provide managers
with a more solid empirical basis for decisions on the adoption of ad-
vanced digital procurement practices, we therefore call for both re-
searchers and practitioners who have already implemented pilot in-
itiatives to measure more systematically the performance outcomes of
digital procurement practices.


The digital procurement practices examined here (i.e., EDI, ad-
vanced digital should-costing tool) mainly targeted the efficiency di-
mension of performance (Cheung et al., 2011). For IndustryCo, the
main goal of implementing EDI was to reduce lead times through effi-
cient information exchange with suppliers. In the cases where EDI was
successfully implemented (Plastics-SPL and Semicon-SPL), the inter-
viewees on both sides of the dyad reported reduced operational work-
load, higher information accuracy, and faster information transfer. This
observation is in line with extant literature, which finds that supply
chain technology use is positively associated with a firm's delivery
performance (Liu et al., 2016). For AutoseatsCo, the main goal of im-
plementing the advanced digital should-costing tool was to increase the
transparency of its suppliers' cost structure and to reduce purchase
prices. In the case where the tool was successfully implemented
(Stampings-SPL), the supplier confirmed that the tool had resulted in
greater transparency and reduced purchase prices.


By increasing overall efficiency, inter-organizational digital pro-
curement practices lead to relational performance – that is, to perfor-
mance benefits mutually generated by two organizations that cannot be

generated by one of those organizations alone (Carter et al., 2017b).
However, the cases seem to suggest that the share of relational per-
formance appropriated by each supply chain member varies. Whereas
IndustryCo's suppliers can probably appropriate at least some share of
the relational performance for themselves through improved process
efficiency, AutoseatsCo likely appropriates the largest share of the re-
lational performance for itself in capturing reduced purchase prices.
Determining the share of relational performance appropriated by buyer
and supplier in a qualitative case study is difficult, but methodological
approaches do exist to empirically assess the distribution of relational
performance using dyadic quantitative data. For example, Cheung et al.
(2011) conducted a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) of a
full set of dyadic relationships to test their hypothesis on the distribu-
tion of relational performance in buyer–supplier dyads.


7. Discussion and conclusion


To summarize our findings and transform them towards a forward-
looking research agenda, in the following we delineate implications
from our study for an SCPV on digital procurement and consider dy-
namic aspects of digital procurement readiness.


7.1. Toward a supply chain practice view on digital procurement


Our empirical observations demonstrate the value of the SCPV as a
useful theoretical lens for research on digital procurement; it offers both
theoretical grounding and strong managerial utility (Corley and Gioia,
2011; Spina et al., 2016). The SCPV provides a holistic framework that
draws attention to three elements: 1) the antecedents that help explain
why firms adopt digital procurement practices; 2) how the use of digital
procurement practices unfolds; and 3) what performance outcomes can
be derived from their use. In addition, the SCPV provides a supply chain-
specific perspective that explicitly considers the interplay of supply
chain partners at the dyad or network level of analysis for each of these
three elements. In digital procurement, we see an area and a range of
practices for which the theoretical potential of the SCPV can be fully
realized.


An underlying assumption of the SCPV is that many of the digital
procurement practices are imitable, and they are neither too surprising
nor too technically complex for many firms to use (Bromiley and Rau,
2016). The digital procurement practices examined in the present study
(EDI, advanced digital should-costing tool) meet the imitability cri-
terion: The advanced digital should-costing tool that AutoseatsCo uses
had been disseminated through a management consultancy, and EDI
has found widespread adoption across industries. Even more advanced
digital procurement practices, such as big data analytics, are often
based on (customizable) software solutions that can usually be bought
on the market.


Considering the notion that many digital procurement practices are
transferable in principle, the question remains as to why certain firms
adopt digital procurement practices while others refrain from doing so.
Our empirical cases identified digital readiness as a key explanatory
factor for the adoption of digital procurement practices in our empirical
setting, incorporating factors such as top management support and IT
infrastructure, which are neither rare nor inimitable. Yet, as suggested
by a neo-configurational perspective (Kosmol et al., 2018; Misangyi
et al., 2017), digital readiness is rarely the only factor influencing the
adoption of digital procurement practices, and causation is often more
complex. Our analysis identified environmental factors and relationship
type as key moderators, while the concept of technological sophistica-
tion illuminated a key attribute of the digital procurement practice it-
self. Furthermore, we acknowledge that both structural states (e.g.,
digital readiness) and events (e.g., a failed EDI implementation at-
tempt) can have an important effect on adoption (e.g., EDI adoption
rate), as suggested by event system theory (Morgeson et al., 2015;
Reimann et al., 2017).


Our findings further illustrate that a certain level of digital readiness
on both sides of the buyer–supplier dyad is a critical antecedent to the
adoption of digital procurement practices. This corroborates the ori-
ginal notion of the SCPV in which the authors called for researchers to
investigate the conditions under which “organizations, dyads, or
broader inter-organizational networks adopt certain practices or refrain
from doing so” (Carter et al., 2017b, p. 119). When studying ex-
planatory variables for digital procurement, research and practice
should therefore consider not only the focal firm but also the dyad and
the broader inter-organizational network.


7.2. Co-evolutionary perspective on digital readiness


The dyadic perspective of the SCPV on digital procurement, as
discussed above, can be further extended by incorporating a dynamic
view on change processes (Andreasen and Gammelgaard, 2018; Langley
et al., 2013). As a variance-based theory, the SCPV thus far has been
concerned primarily with knowing that SCM practice B is more effective
than SCM practice A (Langley et al., 2013). However, Andreasen and
Gammelgaard (2018) caution that “such accounts tend to ignore how to
move from A to B … and thus ignore the actual change processes of PSM
organizations” (Andreasen and Gammelgaard, 2018, p. 2). Therefore,
complementing the inter-organizational perspective inherent in the
SCPV with an angle for studying change processes can enrich the static
picture on digital procurement with a dynamic view on the digital
transformation journey. Given the rapid pace of digital transformation,
incorporating this dynamism into the SCPV on digital procurement
appears particularly relevant.


One possible avenue for moving in this direction would be to take a
co-evolutionary perspective. Applied to the domain of digital procure-
ment, the concept of co-evolution suggests that the buyer's and sup-
pliers' digital readiness might each develop as distinct but mutually
intertwined, co-evolutionary processes, where each party conditions
the other's evolution (Kaufmann et al., 2016; Volberda and Lewin,
2003; Wilhelm and Sydow, 2018). This inherently dyadic concept im-
plies that both the buyer and its suppliers should possess and develop
certain degrees of digital readiness.


The digital readiness matrix, shown in Fig. 2, highlights the mutual
dependency of the buyer's digital procurement readiness and the sup-
plier's digital readiness, indicating a corridor of co-evolution. This
corridor of co-evolution denotes rather synchronized development tra-
jectories of digital readiness between the buyer and the supplier, and
this synchronization is expected to facilitate the adoption of digital
technologies over time. Low levels of digital readiness on both sides of
the dyad might imply that supply chain partners can implement only
basic digital technologies – but through the adoption process, they
might mutually improve their digital readiness over time. High levels of
digital readiness on both sides of the dyad might lead to higher as-
pirations by both parties and enable them to engage in more advanced
digital procurement practices.


How the buyer's development pace relates to the pace of the sup-
plier seems to play a critical role in the notion of co-evolution.
Tentative support for this view is provided by IndustryCo's Head of
Strategic Procurement, who suggested that buyers would need to adjust
their digitalization pace to that of their supply base:


IndustryCo is not independent from its environment, from the city in
which it is located, from China. You cannot be ten years ahead of others;
then you could not integrate with suppliers. I think the best companies are
three or five years ahead; then you can get the most advantages. But you
cannot be successful if you are too quick. (Head of Strategic
Procurement, IndustryCo).
Thus, although the corridor of co-evolution suggests that compar-


able/aligned levels of digital readiness can facilitate the adoption of
digital technologies over time, the concept also allows for some (tem-
porary) differences between the digital readiness of the supply chain


T. Kosmol, et al.


























partners. We can imagine the possibility of co-evolutionary mechanisms
in supply chains, where the competitive dynamics play out in a way
that buying firms exert influence on suppliers to adopt digital tech-
nologies, or that suppliers exert influence on buyers. For example, au-
tomotive manufacturers have successfully promoted the use of EDI
technology in their supply chains through their buying power and the
diffusion of industry standards (Agi et al., 2005; Huo et al., 2017).


Another possible avenue for moving in this direction would be to
include events as explanatory variables in the SCPV. Events might in-
clude hiring a digital procurement officer or experiencing cyber-attacks
in the supply chain; as such, they can trigger change processes and
consequently can influence the trajectory of buyer–supplier relation-
ships in critical ways (Morgeson et al., 2015; Reimann et al., 2017).


7.3. Managerial implications


Interest in the topic of digital procurement is growing quickly
among practitioners, and many remain confused about which organi-
zational prerequisites need to be in place to embark on the journey
toward digital procurement. Our study aims to provide managers with
initial guidance for analyzing their own and their supply base's readiness
in terms of both organizational and technological factors. Importantly,
managers should develop their digital procurement roadmaps with a
close eye on the digital readiness of their supply base so that they co-
evolve together with their supply network. Thinking of their suppliers'
digital readiness as external to their own organization might intuitively
seem true, but managers nevertheless should consider it to be a po-
tential bottleneck on the road to digital procurement; avoiding the
bottleneck requires proactive involvement by the buying firm. Buying
firms can design certain incentive mechanisms (e.g., preferred supplier
status and positive supplier evaluations) or invest resources (e.g.,
trainings or technical support) to help upgrade the digital readiness of
certain key supply chain partners. Even when a buying firm has the


necessary digital procurement readiness, a lack of readiness on the
supplier side impedes the implementation of digital procurement
technologies.


7.4. Limitations and future research directions


We acknowledge several limitations of this study that should be
considered in the interpretation of its results. First, as with any quali-
tative research, despite a methodologically rigorous approach, the
question of whether our insights can be generalized from our empirical
setting to similar contexts is subject to future empirical research
(Flyvbjerg, 2006).


Second, the present study considers only one specific explanatory
variable at the (inter-)organizational level of analysis: digital readiness.
We can conceive of further explanatory variables at various levels of
analysis, such as individual-level characteristics, firm-level strategies,
and country-level factors. In that vein, future research could adopt a
neo-configurational perspective (Kosmol et al., 2018) and analyze
which configurations of explanatory variables support the im-
plementation of digital procurement practices.


Third, our study considered relational performance only at the
dyadic level of a buyer–supplier relationship. However, relational per-
formance also plays a role at the level of digital supply networks (Carter
et al., 2017b). For example, the network performance of IBM's block-
chain solution, which might increase visibility and efficiency in supply
networks, could be measured as the aggregate performance of network
participants (Forrester, 2018). Examining network performance further
responds to a call from Srai and Lorentz (2019) to examine the im-
plications of PSM digitalization beyond firm-level outcomes.


In addition, our study provides only an initial starting point for
further research in this exciting area. Because of the nascent stage of the
field and the pace of the ongoing development of digitalization, many
unanswered questions remain.
