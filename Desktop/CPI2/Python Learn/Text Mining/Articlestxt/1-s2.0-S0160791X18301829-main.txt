There has been a significant transformation in the diffusion of information and communication technology (ICT),
development of the venture capital industry, and economic growth in European countries over the past three
decades. Using vector error-correction modelling, we examine the possible interrelations between venture ca-
pital investment, ICT infrastructure, and economic growth, based on annual data from 25 European countries
between 1989 and 2016. Specifically, we examine the direction of Granger causality between these variables. We
find that the variables are cointegrated. Our empirical results also illustrate that both economic growth and the
development of ICT infrastructure impact all stages of venture capital investment (early, late, and overall VC
investment) in the long run. The study also shows that economic growth and late-stage venture capital invest-
ment impact internet usage; and internet usage and late-stage venture capital impact economic growth in the
long run. The results also reveal strong inter-linkages between the variables in the short run. Overall, empirical
results suggest that policy-makers should give special attention to an integrated policy approach for the co-
development of the ICT infrastructure, venture capital, and economic growth in Europe.


1. Introduction


The European economies have undergone a major transformation
over the last three decades. While some economies have achieved
sustained economic growth, many have experienced lacklustre growth
due to declining total factor productivity and intense competition from
other countries [1]. To ensure countries achieve sustained economic
growth and enhanced global competitiveness, governments in Europe
have invested significant resources to develop and upgrade the in-
formation and communication technology infrastructure [62]. To en-
courage greater innovation and entrepreneurship, these economies
have also embarked on ambitious plans to nurture a vibrant venture
capital (VC) ecosystem [2].


Venture capital (VC) plays a critical role in the creation of wealth
and prosperity in an economy [3–5]. Venture capital is a specialized
form of financial intermediation or investment, which provides funding
to innovative new ventures with high-growth prospects in exchange for
equity stakes in the companies [6,7,10]. VC likely produces several


positive externalities, namely, innovation, job creation, increased
standard of living, investment in infrastructure, service sector growth,
increased productivity, and increased value of VC-financed firms due to
the provisions of both managerial skills and competencies (see Refs.
[11,12]).


We should highlight several issues related to studies of venture
capital. First, while the theoretical foundation has been established
with regards to VC serving as a stimulator for economic growth, there is
still much work to be done to empirically confirm the theory [13].
Second, the results of studies on venture capital activities have pro-
duced a wide range of conclusions that vary considerably (see, for ex-
ample, [14]. Third, a better understanding of the factors that play a
vital role in motivating venture capital investment on a macro level can
lend additional insight to policymakers as they design economic,
technology and financial policies that can promote the growth of ven-
ture capital and, possibly, in turn, economic growth (see, for instance,
[15]). This study focuses on the third issue as we attempt to provide
greater insight into the macro-level factors that are critical to

stimulating venture capital investment.
The literature confirms that there are several factors that contribute


to venture capital investment (see Ref. [16]). Fundamentally, these
factors correspond to foundations that provide the basic structure of an
economy1: macroeconomic stability and the development/standard of
institutional systems (e.g., the legal system, rule of law, quality of ac-
counting standards, quality of regulation and regulatory compliance,
quality of the workforce, cultural orientation, and the availability of
other basic infrastructure such as, information and communication
technology (ICT) infrastructure).


Since the emergence of endogenous growth theory, several em-
pirical studies have considered how economic growth might contribute
to venture capital investment (for example [17–20]), how economic
growth might impact ICT infrastructure [21–25], and how ICT infra-
structure might impact venture capital investment [26]. However, there
is still a dearth of research and insight on the role of ICT infrastructure
in stimulating venture capital investment, especially at different stages.


The contributions of this study are three-fold. First, the results of
this study shed additional light on the Granger-causal relationships
between economic growth and venture capital investment, and between
economic growth and ICT infrastructure in European countries. This
contribution is important as earlier empirical results on the nature of
the relationships between these variables are mixed. In some cases (e.g.
Ref. [26]), the results suggest that economic growth may actually
hinder venture capital investment. Second, this study examines the
trivariate Granger-causal relationship between economic growth, ven-
ture capital investment, and ICT infrastructure. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first empirical study that simultaneously con-
siders the possible Granger-causal relationships between all three
variables. Third, based on the empirical analysis, this study will ‘tease-
out’ key policies pertaining to ICT usage, VC industry, and economic
growth stimulating policies that would enable the European countries
to achieve long-term sustainable economic development.


The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 offers a review of the
literature, discussing what previous papers have established in this field
and highlighting the unique contributions of this study. Section 3 de-
scribes the methodology that is used. Section 4 discusses the empirical
results. Section 5 is devoted to hypotheses validation and discusses the
estimation limitations. Section 6 offers pertinent policy implications.


2. Literature review


2.1. Economic growth and ICT infrastructure


The relationship between economic growth and investment in ICT
infrastructure is well established in the literature. Early studies note the
clear correlation between high economic development and highly de-
veloped telecommunications infrastructure (for example, [27]; and
[28]). ICT might contribute to economic growth through several
channels2: 1) by serving as an important revenue-earning sector in an
economy; 2) by improving market reach for both resources and markets
which in turn enables economies of scale; and 3) by improving products
and services which enables the firm to pursue economies of scale. Al-
ternatively, other studies have shown that economic growth will in-
crease demand for ICT services which leads to increased ICT infra-
structure [15,29]; and [30]. In general, recent studies are interested in
the direction of causality of this relationship between ICT and economic
growth. Four schools of thought are discussed below.


The first school of thought puts forward the ‘Supply-Leading
Hypothesis’ (SLH), which suggests that ICT development leads to eco-
nomic growth. The rationale for this relationship stems from the fact
that ICT investment enhances growth in the ICT industry, thus creating


employment and stimulating economic growth. ICT investment is also
seen as an important enabler for raising the productivity and efficiency
within the economy. It enables economic agents to enhance their reach
for information, knowledge, resources, and markets more easily. High-
quality infrastructure also enables firms to enhance the richness of their
products and services by catering to specific needs of a wider spectrum
of their clientele, all of which contribute to economic growth. Among
the proponents of this school of thought are [22,31–36]; and [37].


The second school of thought comprises the proponents of the
‘Demand-Following Hypothesis’ (DFH), who postulate that economic
growth causes ICT development. The rationale for this argument is
related to the fact that when income levels increase, the various key
stakeholders in the economy will demand more sophisticated tech-
nology that enables them to access information and knowledge to en-
hance their competitiveness and quality of life. Among the studies that
support this hypothesis are [29,32,33,38]; and [39].


The third school of thought advances the ‘Feedback Loop
Hypothesis’ (FLH), which argues that there is a complex relationship
between ICT infrastructure investment and economic growth. That is,
ICT investments contribute to economic growth as suggested by pro-
ponents of SLH. However, economic growth increases the demand for
high-quality ICT infrastructure, thus supporting the DFH school of
thought. Studies that have supported the FLH include [33,38,40]
[8,9,41]; Shiu and Lam, (2008b), and [42].


The fourth school of thought puts forth the ‘Neutrality Hypothesis’
(NH), which argues that there is no causal link between ICT infra-
structure investment and economic growth. Their line of argument
stems from the fact that ICT infrastructure is significantly smaller than
other investments such as the development of physical assets (land,
roads, ports and other infrastructure development), human capital, and
other non-ICT related technology that drive the core sectors of the
economy. Thus, ICT investment has a negligible impact on economic
growth and vice-versa. Studies here include [29,32,33,36]; and [43].3


2.2. Economic growth and venture capital investment


The relationship between the development of the VC industry and
economic development has received considerable attention from in-
dustry analysts, policy-makers, and researchers due to the role of VCs in
providing alternate funding for innovative, high-technology and high-
risk firms. Several studies show that VC development contributes to
economic development by nurturing the development of highly in-
novative firms [5,44]. In some instances, innovative firms can be im-
portant disrupters that give them a competitive edge over incumbent
firms in the global market. Alternatively, perhaps more advanced
countries must establish new sources of funding (e.g. venture capital) to
support the development of risky and innovative firms. As an economy
moves up the innovation value chain, the pool of VC funding increases.
The literature consists of four schools of thoughts regarding the direc-
tion of causality for economic growth and venture capital investment.


In the context of SLH, studies have argued that the development of
the VC industry contributes to economic growth. The economic ratio-
nale stems from the fact that innovation is critical for spurring new
sources of growth; hence, the VC industry plays a crucial role in sup-
porting high-risk innovative firms and ventures, which traditional fi-
nancial markets could not provide capital for. For example, the eco-
nomic growth of the US in the 1990s was primarily driven by VC-
funded technology firms that made both incremental and radical in-
novations in ICT, science, technology, engineering, mathematics
(STEM), life sciences, pharmaceutical and medical areas that, in turn,
transformed the global economic landscape (see, for instance, [45]; and
[46]).

3 As is evident by this review, some studies support more than one hypothesis,
depending on the sample and the period that is covered.

[47] demonstrate that the effect of venture capital investment on
economic and innovation development parameters is significant. By
showing significant VCI influence on GDP, it is clear how important it is
to develop an innovation economy by fostering venture capital inflows.
It is important to treat venture capital investments as the ‘cause’ rather
than the ‘effect’ of the development process. Due to its delayed effect,
venture investment introduces progressive growth in the short- and
long-term by creating competitiveness and shaping the innovation-
based economy. Venture capital investment promotes entrepreneurs,
exports, employment opportunities, technological growth, economic
growth and products, which in turn improves the standard of living of
the people [48]. suggests that the replacement of centrally planned
economies with free-market economies stimulates the demand for
venture capital. A government-created “enabling framework” is first
needed in developing countries to create an attractive playing field and
entrepreneurial infrastructure for venture capitalists. Other empirical
studies that have supported the SLH include [12]; Keuschnigg, (2004)
and Samila and Sorenson, (2011).


On the other hand, the proponents of DFH have argued that, as
economic growth intensifies, the wealth that is generated is invested to
enhance the national innovation ecosystem by increasing investments
in regional corridors, with highly concentrated technology-driven firms
that power new technological developments and discoveries. These new
discoveries have the potential to spawn new sources of economic
growth. To support highly innovative firms, many OECD and devel-
oping countries have opened a wide range of resources to develop the
VC industry. These financial resources include permitting institutional
investors such as pension funds, business angels, and government funds
to grow the pool of VC funding [45]. There are several empirical studies
that support the DFH and among them are [12,14,15,49]; and [30].


There are a few empirical studies that support the FLH, which
suggest that there is a strong feedback loop between the two variables
for several countries, see, for example, [14]; and [12]. These studies
argue that a growing VC industry will raise the number of firms un-
dertaking innovations, which will spur new sectors and sources of
economic growth.


Finally, some studies suggest that the NH holds and that there is no
causal relationship between VC investment and economic growth for
some countries [12,50].


2.3. Venture capital investment and ICT infrastructure


Interestingly, there is little research empirically examining the re-
lationship between VC investment and ICT infrastructure, although
casual evidence suggests that ICT companies are major recipients of VC
funding in many OECD countries. For example, in Europe, which is the
focus of our analysis, more than one-third of VC investments were for
ICT companies [51]. A majority of the studies in the literature have
shown a correlation between VC investment and ICT infrastructure de-
velopment [51,52]. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no
studies that have focused on the direction of causality between the two
variables using rigorous econometric analysis. As such, this study at-
tempts to address this shortcoming in the literature. While this topic is
not well-trodden ground, there is a reason to suspect that there is in-
deed a causal relationship between VC investment and ICT infra-
structure, given that both the VC and ICT industries have undergone
major transformations over the last two decades. There is likely a re-
lationship between the two variables due to the fact that ICT-oriented
businesses, those that create ICT infrastructure or provide ICT services,
are often financed through VC (see, for example, [53–56]).


Some theories and studies would suggest that ICT causes VC. For
example, the rapid ICT diffusion and demand for ICT services across the
globe over the last three decades have intensified R&D activities and
have led to the emergence of new ICT start-ups. These start-ups con-
tribute to the development of new and innovative ICT infrastructure,
including software and applications. One of the challenges encountered


by many of these start-ups includes access to the much-needed capital
for R&D and commercialisation activities. To address the shortage of
high-risk capital for these risky and innovative firms, the VC industry in
many countries within the EU and other countries was established.
Governments in these countries realized that traditional financial sys-
tems would not provide sufficient funding for these high-risk firms.
Hence, many governments created incentives to nurture ‘home-grown’
ICT industries to power the next generation's technology and applica-
tions. These new innovations were envisaged to not only raise the
competitiveness of the broader economy but also to create an ICT in-
dustry that is a revenue generator for the nation (see, for example,
[45,51,52]; and [57]).


Other theories and studies suggest that the development of ICT in-
frastructure contributes to the development of the VC industry. Key
support for this relationship is based on the argument that, VC by its
nature, funds only firms that are innovative and have a potential to
generate returns within 10 years. Innovative firms here are defined as
being able to generate patents or IPs that can be commercialised. A
study by Ref. [58] shows that ICT firms generated more patents than
non-ICT firms. Many of the ICT firms recognise that R&D activities are
plagued by a high risk of failure, uncertainty and asymmetric in-
formation. To overcome these market failures, these firms tend to file
patents to signal that they have assets in the form of patents/IPs that
can be commercialised. Hence, it is not surprising that VC investors
prefer investing in ICT-firms with high patent portfolios because these
patents can be commercialised even if the firms file for bankruptcy
[59]. Increasing digitisation of the economy and demand for new ICT
products and services has resulted in the emergence of many start-ups
in the ICT industry. This has led to an increase in the flow of VC funding
from a wider segment of investors from across the globe to many of ICT
developed regions and countries.


3. Methodology


3.1. Hypotheses


Over the last four decades, many countries across the globe have
invested significant resources to upgrade their ICT infrastructures and
financial systems and to implement economic growth strategies to be
globally competitive. One of the major financial reforms that have been
undertaken is to provide access to finance for high-risk and technology-
intensive firms and start-ups. In this context, many of the countries saw
the emergence of vibrant VC industries from the 1980s onwards to
support the transformation of all sectors of the economy to become
more technology- and knowledge-intensive sectors.


Most of the VC was targeted at developing new technology-intensive
sectors that had the potential to raise the productivity and economic
potential of the broader economy. These technology-based industries
were also envisaged to be new sources of economic growth for many
countries.


In this study, we test the following null hypotheses:


HA1: Venture capital investment does not Granger-cause per capita
economic growth.
HA2: Per capita economic growth does not Granger-cause venture
capital investment.
HB1: ICT infrastructure development does not Granger-cause per ca-
pita economic growth.
HB2: Per capita economic growth does not Granger-cause ICT infra-
structure development.
HC1: Venture capital investment does not Granger-cause ICT infra-
structure development.
HC2: ICT infrastructure development does not Granger-cause venture
capital investment.
These hypotheses are summarized in Fig. 1.

3.2. Data


We utilize annual time series data obtained from World Development
Indicators published by the World Bank and the European Venture
Capital Association's Venture Capital Database. We cover 25 European
countries,4 for which data was readily available, from 1989-2016.5


We use real per capita economic growth (PEG), which is measured
as the percentage change in real per capita GDP, and three different
indicators for venture capital investment (VCI). The three VCI in-
dicators6 are differentiated by the stage of the investments and are
measured as a percentage of real GDP. Early stage VC investment (VCE)
is VC investment aimed towards young businesses that are primarily in
their early development stage. Later stage VC investment (VCL) is the
type of VC investment aimed at young businesses in need of funds for


expansion. Total VC investment (VCT) combines both the early and
later stages of VC investment.


We use six different indicators7 as proxies for ICT infrastructure
development: telephone landlines (TEL), mobile phones (MOB), in-
ternet users (INU), internet servers (INS), and fixed broadband (FIB).
We also use a composite index of ICT infrastructure (CIC8), using
principal component analysis (PCA) (procedural details are discussed in
Ref. [35]. These proxies have been used in several earlier studies such
as [32,38]. A more detailed definition of these variables is available in
Table A1 under Appendix A.9


Our study considers three samples and six cases, where the samples
are differentiated by choice of VCI indicator and the cases are de-
termined by choice of ICT indicator. The first sample links VCE, ICT,
and PEG, the second links VCL, ICT, and PEG, and the third sample links
VCT, ICT, and PEG. In each sample, we consider six cases which differ
based on the selection of the ICT indicator (TEL, MOB, INU, INS, FIB, or
CIC). The sample size (using various VCI indicators) is not uniform. It

4 The choice of the European countries was due to the availability of the data
to undertake advance panel data analysis for the three variables under study. It
was challenging to obtain detailed data for some of the indicators, especially for
the venture capital indicators, for countries in other regions.


5 The countries are Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Denmark,
Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia,
Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania,
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.


6 These proxies have been used in earlier studies such as [14].

pulation.

INU, INS, and FIB).

pirical investigation process.

varies from case to case depending upon the data availability over the
period that is covered. Descriptive statistics (mean, maximum,
minimum, standard deviation, skewness and kurtosis) on the variables
as well as unit root test statistics are available in Table A2 in Appendix
A.


3.3. The econometric methodology


We use the following vector error-correction model (VECM) to in-
vestigate the possible directions of causality among our three sets of
variables.

where Δ is the first difference operator; i is the country specification in
the panel; t is year; and ε is the uncorrelated error term. Venture capital
investment is defined as VCE, VCL, or VCT. ICT infrastructure is defined
as TEL, MOB, INU, INS, FIB, or CIC.


The ECTit-1 terms are the one-period lag residual of the model (the
lagged error-correction terms), obtained from the cointegrating equa-
tion that represents the long-run dynamics; while the differenced
variables represent the short-run dynamics between the variables. The
lagged ECT terms measure the rate by which the long-term dis-
equilibrium in the dependent variable restores back to the equilibrium.


The above model provides robust results if the variables are in-
tegrated of order one, I [1], and cointegrated. If the variables used in


Eq. (1) are not cointegrated, the ECT-1's are removed in the estimation
process. The directions of causation can be identified by testing the
significance of the coefficient of each of the dependent variables in Eq.
(1). First, we test the long-run Granger causality by looking at the
significance of the speed of adjustment λ, which is the coefficient of the
error correction term. The sign of λ should be negative after estimation.
The higher the value of λ (in absolute term), the faster is the response of
the variable to the previous period's deviations from the long-run
equilibrium. The significance of λ indicates the long-run relationship of
the cointegrated process, and so movements along this path can be
considered permanent. For long-run causality, we test H0: λji = 0 for
j= 1, 2, and 3. Next, the study tests the short-run Granger causality test
and for this, we test H0: гik = 0 for all three variables. Specifically, we
are interested in the direction of causality: both directions, from one
variable to the other, or no causality.


4. Empirical results and discussion


In panel data analysis, the first step is a panel unit root test to de-
termine the stationarity properties of the relevant variables. We use two
panel unit roots, due to [60,61] since no significant evidence of error
cross-sectional dependence is found in the data. These tests confirm that
all the variables are I [1].10 These results suggest cointegration between
venture capital investment, ICT infrastructure, and per capita economic
growth. The Johansen-Fisher Panel cointegration test with an in-
dividual intercept is then used to test the hypothesis that there is a long-
run relationship between these variables. The results from this test
demonstrate the existence of a long-run equilibrium relationship be-
tween the three variables in our three samples and six cases (see
Table 1).


The above findings support our VECM approach to examine the

Granger causal relationships among the variables, the results of which
are summarized in Table 2. We first present the long-run results, as-
certained by examining the statistical significance of the ECT-1 coeffi-
cients. Table 2 shows that when ΔVCI11 is the dependent variable, the
lagged ECT coefficients are negative and statistically significant at the
1% level.12 This confirms the existence of a stable long-run relationship
and points to a long-run cointegration relationship between these
variables. The lagged ECTs represent the speed of adjustment to restore
equilibrium in the dynamic model following a disturbance. The coef-
ficients of the lagged ECTs vary between −0.32 and −0.001, implying
that a deviation from the long-run equilibrium following a short-run
shock is corrected by about 32%–1% after each year.


Our results in Table 2 also reveal that venture capital investment
tends to converge to its long-run equilibrium path in response to changes
in ICT infrastructure and per capita economic growth. This is true for all
three samples and six cases that we consider. Therefore, the overall
conclusion is that venture capital investment in European countries is
significantly influenced by both ICT infrastructure and economic growth.


In other words, to stimulate long-run venture capital investment, it is
important to enhance both ICT infrastructure and economic growth in
European countries. Needless to say, smart use of ICT by businesses and
strong formation of digital supply chains will increase the demand for
new ICT infrastructure, which will help spawn new ICT start-up firms,
creating a dynamic and vibrant VC industry in Europe.


Finally, there is some evidence of feedback causality between VCI
and economic growth in the long run. This is evident under Sample 2
(Cases 3 and 6) and Sample 3 (Cases 1 and 2). These results show in the
long run, economic growth and late-stage venture capital investment
have a significant impact on internet usage. Further, internet usage and
late-stage venture capital directly influence economic growth in the long
run. The VC funding is given to firms after they have commenced com-
mercialisation activities prior to moving to initial public offering (IPO).
The late VC funding is normally used to scale-up the firms' operations,
including expanding firms’ plant and digital capabilities, enabling them
to enhance their product quality, market reach, branding and positioning
prior to IPO – all of which will contribute to firm performance and
contribute to the GDP growth of Europe. These interesting results high-
light that the internet is increasingly becoming the backbone of the
global supply chain. Hence, the dynamics captured by Sample 2 (Cases 3
and 6) and Sample 3 (Cases 1 and 2) provides further support for the
structural changes taking place in the European economies.

In the short run, the results are mostly non-uniform, with two ex-
ceptions: we found unidirectional causality from telephone landlines to
economic growth and the bidirectional causality between the composite
index of ICT infrastructure and venture capital investment. We sum-
marize the non-uniform short-run results in Table 3, demonstrating that
the short-run adjustment dynamics vary across samples/cases. The
details of these results are presented below.


Hypothesis 1. (HA1, 2) contends that the venture capital investment
Granger-causes economic growth, and vice versa. We find mixed short-
run results regarding this hypothesis. With Cases 1, 2, 5, and 6 (in
Sample 1: VCE), Cases 4 and 6 (in Sample 2: VCL), and Cases 1, 3, and 6
(in Sample 3: VCT), we find unidirectional causality between per capita
economic growth and venture capital investment. Conversely, we find
bidirectional causality between per capita economic growth and
venture capital investment with Cases 3 and 4 (in Sample 1), Cases 1,
2, 3, and 5 (in Sample 2), and Cases 2, 3 and 5 (in Sample 3).


Hypothesis 2. (HA1, 2) contends that ICT infrastructure Granger-causes
per capita economic growth, and vice versa. We also find mixed short-
run evidence regarding this hypothesis. With Cases 1, 3, 5, and 6 (in
Sample 1: VCE), Cases 1 and 6 (in Sample 2: VCL), and Cases 1 and 5 (in
Sample 3: VCT), we find unidirectional causality between per capita
economic growth and venture capital investment. We find bidirectional
causality between per capita economic growth and venture capital
investment with Cases 2 and 4 (in Sample 1), Cases 2, 4, and 5 (in
Sample 2), and Cases 2, 4 and 6 (in Sample 3). We also find the evidence
of neutrality in a few cases, such as Case 3 in both Samples 2 and 3.


Hypothesis 3. (HA1, 2) posits that venture capital investment Granger-
causes ICT infrastructure, and vice versa. As with the other two
hypotheses, short-run causality results here are mixed. With Cases 1,
2, 3, and 5 (in Sample 1: VCE), Cases 1 and 4 (in Sample 2: VCL), and
Case 4 (in Sample 3: VCT), we find unidirectional causality between
venture capital investment and ICT infrastructure. On the contrary, the
study finds bidirectional causality between ICT infrastructure and
venture capital investment with Cases 4 and 6 (in Sample 1), Cases 2,
3, 5, and 6 (in Sample 2), and Cases 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 (in Sample 3).


The discussions above show that the development of the digital


economy in Europe opens up new opportunities for firms to enhance
their productivity and economic performance, fuelling the demand for
VC funding. On the other hand, the strong economic growth potential of
the firms and access to VC funding will enable firms to adopt new
business models underpinned by advanced ICT infrastructure and sys-
tems. This will increase the demand for and contribute to the devel-
opment of ICT infrastructure. The results show that the impacts of ICT,
venture capital funding and economic growth reinforce and deepen one
another – all of which are critical for the sustained economic perfor-
mance of in European countries.


Evidently, the mixture of bidirectional and unidirectional causality
results for the short-run and long-run dynamics show that there are
strong inter-linkages between the variables. Hence, careful curation of
policies to develop the ICT infrastructure and adoption rates, the es-
tablishment of a vibrant VC industry, and implementation of economic
growth promoting strategies must take into consideration the ‘spill-
over’ impacts these policies have on the digital and VC ecosystems and
GDP growth in Europe.


5. Hypotheses validation and limitations of the study


To supplement our analysis, some additional estimations were
performed. The analyses and results, though not reported here because
of space constraints,13 deserve a brief mention. First, the FMOLS14 and
DOLS15 were used to capture the dynamics between venture capital
investment, ICT infrastructure, and economic growth. Second, a

14 FMOLS is fully modified ordinary least squares (OLS), a non-parametric
estimation approach, which takes into account the possible correlation between
the error term and the first differences of regressor as well as the presence of a
constant term to deal with corrections for serial correlation (see, for instance,
Maeso-Fernandez et al., 2006; Pedroni, 2000).


15 DOLS is dynamic OLS, a parametric estimation approach that adjusts the
errors by augmenting the static regression with leads, lags, and con-
temporaneous values of the regressor in first differences (see, for instance, Kao
and Chiang, 2000).

sensitivity analysis was performed by changing the order of the vector
error-correction model. Third, Generalised Impulse Response Functions
(GIRFs) were used to gain additional insights into how the shocks to the
variables impact the other variables. These additional estimation results
generally support our earlier overall findings. In particular, the results
from our sensitivity analysis did not present a substantial change to our
earlier main findings.


Nonetheless, a brief discussion of some of the limitations of our
study is in order. First, while the deployment of VECM is an appropriate
methodology, our study has not considered non-linearity tests and/or
structural breaks, which may lead to biases in the results. Second, our
study could not incorporate some of the other ICT indicators like the
internet of things (IoT) and usage of other ICT devices due to the lack of
available data over the sample period for the European countries.


6. Policy implication and concluding remarks


This study uses advanced statistical techniques to study the complex
short-term and long-term relationships between venture capital in-
vestment, ICT infrastructure, and economic growth simultaneously in
Europe. In doing so, we integrate three strands of the literature, which
examine the link between two of these variables at a time. The em-
pirical analysis shows that the three variables are cointegrated. Most
importantly, there is clear evidence that both ICT infrastructure and
economic growth matter in the determination of long-run venture ca-
pital investment. In the short term, the results also show that in most
cases, the development of ICT infrastructure, VC industry, and eco-
nomic growth deepen and reinforce one another. These empirical re-
sults confirm the view expressed by policymakers and industry experts
that the formation of digital supply chains and the development of new
business models using the digital platforms will create a vibrant VC
industry and spur economic growth in Europe [62,63]; and [64].


The empirical results also suggest that in order to stimulate sus-
tained economic growth in the European economies, policy-makers
should give careful thought to the inter-dependence of the various
policy measures pertaining to the development of ICT, the VC industry,
and economic growth. Key policies related to ICT infrastructure de-
velopment, the creation of a vibrant VC industry, and development of a
sound economic ecosystem in Europe are outlined below.


First, priority should be given to putting in place a systematic fra-
mework in Europe to continuously develop and upgrade the ICT in-
frastructure so as to ensure that firms have access to state-of-the-art ICT
infrastructure. This will enable them to enhance their reach for re-
sources, knowledge and markets, and assist them in improving the
quality of their products and services. The ICT strategy should also
incorporate the development of user-friendly and affordable technology
and applications for consumers to use the digital platforms to gain ac-
cess to new products and services.


Greater adoption of ICT will also be reinforced by facilitating af-
fordable ICT literacy programs and strengthening the digital regulatory
architecture to mitigate risks associated with cybercrimes. Various
programs have been introduced by some of the countries in Europe to
raise the firms' ICT skills, especially SMEs. Among them are the fol-
lowing: peer-to-peer digital skill programs; mentorship of SME's by


larger and well-established corporations; access to ICT skills training
programs from vocational institutes, colleges and institutions of higher
learning; and online ICT skills training programs. In this context, the
introduction of the European e-Business Network, which helps strengthen
ICT education and the digital supply chain for e-business, is a positive
step towards promoting digital entrepreneurship and economic growth
among the SMEs in Europe [65]. Further, the establishment of the
European Cybercrime Centre, which helps monitor and put in place
measures to address cybercrime, cybersecurity and data privacy, has
played a key role in enhancing business and consumer confidence,
which will likely increase the use of digital platforms by all stake-
holders [66].


The second priority is to pursue GDP growth-promoting strategies,
which include creating appropriate incentives to increase domestic and
foreign investments into the European economies, especially in the ICT-
driven industries. These investments are important for developing the
ICT infrastructure, increasing the supply of ICT-savvy workforces and
strengthening the VC industry in Europe. Among the key business-
friendly policies are the following: removal of barriers that hinder di-
gital entrepreneurship; regulatory reforms to harmonise legislations,
laws and business practises among the diverse member countries in
Europe; and mobilisation of resources to nurture vibrant start-up eco-
systems, incubators, and accelerators that foster e-governance, digital
innovation and job creation in Europe [62,65].


The third priority is to foster strong and vibrant VC ecosystems in
Europe, which will not only create employment but also spawn new
technology start-ups that will lead to the development of next-genera-
tion competitive industries. Among the major challenges faced by the
European VC industry are the following: lack of harmonisation of reg-
ulatory and financial systems in member countries; low economic
growth potential in many of the developing economies in Europe; and
low levels of private and institutional investors [2]. Strengthening and
harmonising the financial regulations, increasing digital entrepreneur-
ship, and developing strong digital supply chains will be important
drivers for increasing promising business ventures in the less developed
or emerging regions of Europe – all of which, will result in stronger and
more dynamic VC industries across Europe.


In summary, this study highlights the strong interdependence be-
tween the ICT infrastructure, venture capital, and economic growth,
both in the short run and long run, in Europe. These results suggest that
policymakers in the region should take an integrated approach to
capture the positive externalities of the policy intervention strategies
pertaining to the creation of a sound digital economy and a vibrant VC
industry to ensure sustainable economic growth in Europe. Lessons
from this European case study provide valuable insights for policy-
makers in other regions on co-development strategies pertaining to the
development of ICT infrastructure, the VC industry and other economic
growth promoting initiatives.
