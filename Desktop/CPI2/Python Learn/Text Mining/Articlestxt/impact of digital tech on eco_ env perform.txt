Digital technologies for Industry 4.0, such as the Internet of Things, cloud computing, big data and analytics, 
have attracted much attention from both researchers and practitioners. Based on information processing theory, 
this study intends to explore how digital technologies influence economic and environmental performance in the 
new era of Industry 4.0. The mediating effect of digital supply chain platforms and the moderating effect of 
environmental dynamism are proposed and evaluated using a survey of Chinese manufacturing firms. The results 
indicate that digital supply chain platforms mediate the effects of digital technologies on both economic and 
environmental performance and that the mediating effects are enhanced under a high degree of environmental 
dynamism. This study offers an enhanced understanding of the performance implications of digital technologies 
and provides managerial insights into how to promote economic and environmental sustainability in the era of 
Industry 4.0.   


1. Introduction 


In the new era of Industry 4.0, the development and adoption of 
digital technologies has become one of the most frequently trending 
topics in both academic and professional areas. The term “digital tech-
nologies” refers to a collection and a paradigm of various intelligent and 
innovative technologies in the era of Industry 4.0, such as big data an-
alytics, the Internet of Things and cloud computing, which realize con-
nectivity, communication and automation (Ardolino et al., 2018; Frank 
et al., 2019; Ivanov et al., 2019). In a digitally driven manufacturing 
system, these emerging advanced technologies empower companies to 
adopt data-driven strategies for collecting data across the product life 
cycle ranging from material properties and process parameters (Tao 
et al., 2018) and to improve the vertically and horizontally integrated 
manufacturing system (Frank et al., 2019). 


Digital technologies bring both opportunities and challenges for the 
sustainable development of manufacturing companies. With the deep 
integration of intelligent technologies in the manufacturing industry, 
there has been a digital transformation that has changed the traditional 
production and operations management methods and offers the poten-
tial for the improvement of product development, production efficiency 
and customer service (Neuhofer et al., 2015). Moreover, these advanced 


technologies can enable the efficient allocation of resources and there-
fore unlock the full potential of environmental sustainability (Gobbo 
et al., 2018; Jabbour et al., 2018; Dubey et al., 2019). However, 
emerging technologies may further increase the competitive dynamics 
in business environments and impose financial and environmental 
burdens on manufacturing firms (Kiel et al., 2017). In this case, digital 
technologies may lead to unintended negative consequences on sus-
tainable development. It should be noted that how digital technologies 
influence sustainability performance in terms of economic and envi-
ronmental performance is still under-investigated. 


This study argues that the effect of digital technologies on sustain-
ability performance needs to be realized through a well-established 
supply chain platform. Prior studies have recognized the role of 
advanced digital technologies for Industry 4.0 in supply chain re-
lationships (Zhou et al., 2015; Govindan et al., 2018; Ben-Daya et al., 
2019). Further, the establishment of digital supply chain platforms en-
ables massive information gathering and disposal and excellent coop-
eration and integration (Büyük€ozkan and G€oçer, 2018). To achieve 
sustainable development, manufacturing firms are encouraged to extend 
the application of digital technologies into supply chains and to connect 
with their supply chain partners (Camara et al., 2015). However, while 
scholars aim to integrate digital technologies with supply chains, few

studies have empirically explored how digital technologies influence 
economic and environmental sustainability through the establishment 
of digital supply chain platforms. 


The theoretical foundation for our research study is drawn from the 
information processing theory (IPT) (Galbraith, 1973; Premkumar et al., 
2005). Operations and environmental management are identified as 
information-intensive processes (Lai et al., 2015; Addo-Tenkorang and 
Helo, 2016). IPT indicates that an organization as an open 
social-economical system can achieve superior performance by 
improving its informational processing capabilities and information 
quality (Galbraith, 1973; Premkumar et al., 2005). Digital technologies 
form the internal information architecture, which represents a firm’s 
information processing capabilities. Moreover, supply chain platforms 
serve as the channel for the information exchange between supply chain 
partners, which is regarded as a major source of external information. 
The enhanced information processing capabilities complementing the 
external supply chain information lead to the sustainable development 
of manufacturing firms. Therefore, based on IPT, this study examines 
how digital technologies are applied in supply chain relationships and 
the resulting impact on economic and environmental performance. 


In addition, we investigate how the impacts of digital technologies 
would be varied by contingency factors such as environmental dyna-
mism. IPT highlights that the organization’s information processing 
capabilities and information requirements should be matched with the 
business environment. It is suggested that the performance of imple-
menting advanced digital technologies and supply chain platforms may 
be affected by environmental conditions (Raymond, 2005; Cegielski 
et al., 2012; Mithas et al., 2013). This study focuses on environmental 
dynamism, which refers to the instability or volatility of a firm’s envi-
ronment (Azadegan et al., 2013; Chan et al., 2016), and argues that the 
impact of digital technologies and supply chain platforms on economic 
and environmental performance is contingent upon environmental 
dynamism. 


This study will contribute to relevant research from three aspects. 
First, we intend to establish the links between digital technologies and 
two dimensions of sustainability performance (i.e., economic and 
environmental performance), which can help enhance the understand-
ing of the performance implications of digital technologies in Industry 
4.0. Second, we propose the mediating effect of digital supply chain 
platforms on the relationships between digital technologies and eco-
nomic and environmental performance, thus establishing a mechanism 
explaining how digital technologies relate to economic and environ-
mental performance. Third, we identify a contextual factor (i.e., envi-
ronmental dynamism) to determine the effectiveness of digital 
technologies and supply chain platforms. The remainder of this paper is 
arranged as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant literature and Sec-
tion 3 proposes the hypotheses. We show the research methodology in 
Section 4 and present the results in Section 5. Finally, the paper ends 
with our discussion and conclusions in Section 6. 


2. Literature review 


2.1. Digital technologies in industry 4.0 


Industry 4.0, which originally initiated in Germany, is the fourth 
industrial revolution in manufacturing. The concept of Industry 4.0 and 
its other synonyms, such as smart manufacturing, smart production or 
smart factories, refer to “the horizontal and vertical integration of pro-
duction systems driven by real-time data interchange and flexible 
manufacturing to enable customized production” (Jabbour et al., 2018, 
p. 19). In the era of Industry 4.0, advanced digital technologies, which 
are mostly mentioned by practitioners and researchers, include the 
Internet of Things, cloud computing, big data and analytics (Jabbour 
et al., 2018). Ivanov et al. (2019) particularly note that firms are inte-
grating and interconnecting these local solutions to enhance their 
data-processing capabilities. In other words, digital technologies are 


expected to covary or interact with each other in the new era of Industry 
4.0, which represents the organization’s information processing capa-
bilities in the new era of Industry 4.0. 


The Internet of Things, as one of the latest information technology 
breakthroughs, refers to an information technology infrastructure that 
establishes the interconnectivity of physical objects and enables data 
collection and transmission between devices (Lee and Lee, 2015). The 
four main essential layers of the Internet of Things are a sensing layer to 
integrate radio frequency identification (RFID) tags, sensors and actu-
ators; a networking layer to support information transfers through 
wireless sensor networks; a service layer to integrate services and ap-
plications through middleware technology; and an interface layer to 
display information, identify problems and suggest solutions to the user 
(Xu et al., 2014). Scholars have discussed the application of the Internet 
of Things in operations and supply chain management, such as 
manufacturing systems (Tao et al., 2014), innovative product delivery 
(YU et al., 2015), mass customization (Ng et al., 2015) and end-of-life 
product recovery (Joshi and Gupta, 2019). 


Cloud computing is applied to realize the aggregation, management, 
optimal allocation and on-demand use of information and data in the 
form of remote service (Tao et al., 2014; Liu and Xu, 2017). Camara et al. 
(2015) define cloud computing as a bundle of virtualized and distributed 
resources that can be accessed on an on-demand basis through software 
as a service, infrastructure as a service and platform as a service. 
Scholars summarize four types of deployment models, i.e., public clouds, 
private clouds, community clouds and hybrid clouds (Singh et al., 2015; 
Kochan et al., 2018). With cloud computing, manufacturing firms can 
access substantial and customized information from the cloud service 
provider via the Internet with no investment in complex and on-premise 
systems. Schniederjans and Hales (2016) summarize that cloud 
computing is characterized by massively scalable and virtualized re-
sources, reduced support infrastructure needs, the rapid deployment of 
information and green computing potential. It is expected that cloud 
computing will promote the future development of manufacturing firms 
in the manufacturing community. 


The application of big data and analytics is closely interlinked to 
enable manufacturing firms to make better decisions. Hence, prior 
literature has always discussed the two digital technologies together. 
Scholars define big data in terms of the 5 V’s (Wamba et al., 2015): (1) 
volume, indicating the large amount of data; (2) variety, implying a 
large variety of sources and multidimensional data fields; (3) veracity, to 
ensure the quality of the data and reliable prediction through big data 
analytics; (4) velocity, indicating the frequency of data generation and 
delivery; and (5) value, stressing the economic benefits from data 
extraction and transformation. Analytics refers to “the ability to gain 
insights from data by applying statistics, mathematics, econometrics, 
simulations, optimizations or other techniques” (Wang et al., 2016, p. 
99). Big data and predictive analytics allow the use of advanced infor-
mation technology tools and architectures to collect, store, extract and 
analyse a large amount of data for decision-making processes (Wamba 
et al., 2015). In the context of Industry 4.0, there are many areas in 
operations and supply chain management that benefit from big data and 
analytics technologies, such as investigations of supply chain risks (Wu 
et al., 2017), social and environmental sustainability (Dubey et al., 
2019), supply chain and organizational performance (Gunasekaran 
et al., 2017), and servitization (Opresnik and Taisch, 2015). 


2.2. Digital supply chain platforms 


Digital supply chain platforms have been proposed since traditional 
information and communication technologies are developed and 
applied (Pettit and Wang, 2016), and are defined as the digitally driven 
infrastructure a focal firm has established “for the consistent and 
high-velocity transfer of supply chain-related information within and 
across its boundaries” (Rai et al., 2006, p. 229). Reuver et al. (2018) note 
that a digital platform can “be characterized as a sociotechnical 


Y. Li et al.

assemblage encompassing the technical elements (of software and 
hardware) and associated organizational processes and standards” (p. 
126). Compared with the focus on technical elements of the concept, 
Büyük€ozkan and G€oçer (2018) highlight that digital supply chain plat-
forms are related to how supply chain processes are managed in a digital 
form. Following the view of Rai et al. (2006) and Büyük€ozkan and G€oçer 
(2018), our study mainly emphasizes the establishment of 
cross-organizational platforms that realize digital connectivity, system 
integration and information exchange within the supply chains. 


In the era of Industry 4.0, scholars have begun to explore the 
application of advanced digital technologies in supply chains through 
narrative literature reviews or exploratory case studies (Addo-Tenkor-
ang and Helo, 2016; Wang et al., 2016; Govindan et al., 2018; Nguyen 
et al., 2018; Tiwari et al., 2018; Ben-Daya et al., 2019). In addition, 
Waller and Fawcett (2013) note that data science, predictive analytics 
and big data will contribute to the transformation in supply chain design 
and management. Gunasekaran et al. (2017) indicate that big data and 
predictive analytics can improve supply chain performance through 
visibility and decision making. Ben-Daya et al. (2019) advocate that the 
Internet of Things enables the remote coordination and management of 
supply chain operations. Kochan et al. (2018) identify cloud computing 
as an enabler of electronic supply chain management systems. Advanced 
and interconnected technologies are dynamically reconfigurable to 
establish a digitally driven network within the supply chain and to 
support communication within and across organizational boundaries 
(Zhou et al., 2015; Govindan et al., 2018). 


Scholars have also indicated that digital supply chain platforms 
contribute to coordinating external suppliers, customers and other 
partners, providing on-demand access to external information, and 
promoting real-time communication and integration of the supply chain 
(Frank et al., 2019). Yu et al. (2018) confirm that a data-driven supply 
chain has a significantly positive effect on supply chain capabilities, 
including information exchange, coordination, activity integration and 
responsiveness, which leads to financial performance. However, 
Büyük€ozkan and G€oçer (2018) note that although digital supply chain 
platforms are the key for organizations’ competitive advantages, many 
specific benefits are untapped. Studies that address the establishment 
and benefits of digital supply chain platforms are still in their early 
stages. It is necessary to empirically investigate the impact of digital 
technologies for Industry 4.0 on the establishment of supply chain 
platforms and the role of digital supply chain platforms for modern 
manufacturing firms. 


2.3. Information processing theory 


IPT was proposed to support the design of organizational structures 
(Galbraith, 1973). Based on IPT, information-processing needs and in-
formation processing capabilities should be matched to obtain the 
optimal performance (Premkumar et al., 2005). Information-processing 
needs are determined by various environmental contexts in which the 
organization is located, while information processing capabilities refer 
to the configurations of resources, technology architecture and other 
work units that facilitate information collection, processing and distri-
bution (Galbraith, 1973; Tushman and Nadler, 1978). To cope with 
environmental dynamism or the frequency of changes in environmental 
factors, organizations can adopt two strategies to support decision 
making and improve performance: (1) acquire a greater amount of 
high-quality information to reduce the effect of dynamism and (2) 
devote more efforts to improving information processing capabilities for 
effective decision making (Fan et al., 2017). Recently, IPT has been 
extensively applied in information systems (Wong et al., 2015), tech-
nology integration (Stock and Tatikonda, 2008), production control 
systems (Gong et al., 2014), maintenance management (Swanson, 2003) 
and supply chain management (Cegielski et al., 2012; Fan et al., 2017). 


Previous studies have tended to identify digital technologies as the 
key aspect of the organization’s information processing capabilities. 


Based on IPT, Premkumar et al. (2005) suggest access to information 
processing capabilities through information technology support. Mel-
ville and Ramirez (2008) highlight that information processing capa-
bilities can be enhanced through investments in technology-based 
process improvement (e.g., the adoption of information technology). 
Cegielski et al. (2012) define information processing capabilities as the 
organization’s capability “to utilize and structure information in a 
meaningful fashion that supports decision making” (p. 189) and regard 
cloud-based infrastructure as a proxy for organizational information 
processing capabilities. In this study, the Internet of Things, cloud 
computing, big data and analytics are structured and linked to handle 
needed quantities of information and therefore represent the organiza-
tion’s information processing capabilities. Moreover, digital supply 
chain platforms provide information exchange channels to access 
external information. That is, digital technologies drive supply chain 
platforms to satisfy information requirements caused by environmental 
dynamism. 


3. Hypotheses development 


3.1. Digital technologies and economic and environmental performance 


Operations and environmental management are both identified as 
information-intensive activities (Lai et al., 2015; Addo-Tenkorang and 
Helo, 2016). From the perspective of IPT, digital technologies represent 
the firm’s information processing capabilities to support 
decision-making processes related to operations and environmental 
management. It can be foreseen that digital technologies in Industry 4.0 
will contribute to the improvement of manufacturing firms’ economic 
and environmental performance through information gathering and 
processing. 


Digital technologies support the decisions of production planning 
and control through efficient information processing (Nguyen et al., 
2018), which can enhance operational efficiency, reduce the cost and 
increase profits. In an advanced manufacturing system, firms configure 
the Internet of Things, cloud computing, big data and analytics to more 
efficiently and effectively collect and process production- and 
operations-related information. The Internet of Things establishes a 
global network in which tags, sensors, actuators and other physical 
devices are heterogeneously interconnected within plants to exchange 
data and communicate with each other (Ardolino et al., 2018). 
Machine-to-machine communication (M2M), as a classic example of the 
application of the Internet of Things, can realize data gathering and 
exchange remotely and automatically (Frank et al., 2019). Cloud 
computing provides the service of the remote storing of real-time 
operational data and on-demand access to data displayed in a cloud 
(Camara et al., 2015). In this case, the Internet of Things and cloud 
computing can realize the full sharing, free circulation, on-demand use 
and optimal allocation of information required by manufacturing (Tao 
et al., 2014), resulting in high operational efficiency. While a tremen-
dous amount of data are generated, collected and integrated in the 
manufacturing system, big data and analytics can further help to identify 
and extract valuable information for manufacturing firms to make 
effective and correct decisions (Gunasekaran et al., 2017; Wamba et al., 
2017). Overall, the enhanced information processing capability is the 
key enabler to improve production efficiency and hence obtain a 
competitive advantage (Cao et al., 2019). 


Additionally, digital technologies support the decisions of demand 
forecasting, price optimization and product development (YU et al., 
2015; Joshi and Gupta, 2019), which can better satisfy customers’ de-
mands and increase market share and sales. Wong et al. (2015) support 
this idea and indicate that information technology infrastructure can 
lead to customer service performance. Manufacturing firms are 
encouraged to embed the Internet of Things, cloud computing, big data 
and analytics into the whole value chain of a product from design to 
after-sales (Curran et al., 2007). These advanced digital technologies can

provide sufficient product and market information, thus enabling 
product optimization and demand forecasting to rapidly respond to 
customers’ requests. Moreover, with digital technologies for informa-
tion processing, firms can reconfigure production lines and resources for 
the production of customized products in a more flexible and efficient 
way (Dalenogare et al., 2018). Wamba et al. (2015) highlight a digitally 
enabled infrastructure, and multiple data sources allow the firm to tailor 
customer demands and seek new market opportunities. Furthermore, 
customized products can create a differentiated competitive advantage 
and increase their perceived values. Therefore, it is hypothesized that 
the application of digital technologies will lead to the improvement of 
economic performance: 


H1a. Digital technologies have a positive impact on economic 
performance. 


This study also suggests a positive relationship between digital 
technologies and environmental performance. The achievement of 
environmental performance requires the integration of environmental 
concerns into traditional product development and manufacturing 
processes (Schniederjans and Hales, 2016), which makes the decisions 
and operations more complex. Digital technologies can provide efficient 
solutions for green product design, production and service processes, 
which lead to less hazardous pollutants and minimize natural resource 
consumption in the entire product life cycle. The Internet of Things, 
cloud-based design and big data analytics allow for enhanced informa-
tion flow management and facilitate green product development and 
eco-design innovation (Wu et al., 2015; Dubey et al., 2019). Jabbour 
et al. (2018) indicate that manufacturing firms use digital technologies 
to collect and process accurate consumption information, thus enabling 
product development with the 5 R’s strategy (i.e., reduce, repair, reuse, 
recycle, and remanufacture). The RFID tags and sensors embedded in 
products collect all the data about a product’s life cycle and monitor 
components’ conditions for reuse, recycling and remanufacturing (Tao 
et al., 2016; Joshi and Gupta, 2019). As a result, digital technologies 
support eco-product design and promote product optimization to 
minimize the environmental impact. 


Moreover, the use of digital technologies can help improve infor-
mation gathering and processing to better control energy efficiency, 
water quality, air pollution and heavy metals through automatically 
optimizing production processes (Gobbo et al., 2018). In the digitally 
enabled manufacturing system, firms embed sensors and RFID tech-
nology in the production equipment or production line connected to the 
Internet, which can efficiently collect production information and con-
trol environmental conditions in real time. This approach is echoed by 
Bai and Sarkis (2017), who find that advanced manufacturing technol-
ogies have the potential to support green manufacturing processes. 
Peukert et al. (2015) indicate that digital technologies such as 
data-centred carbon footprint analyses contribute to the reduction of 
greenhouse gas emissions. Jabbour et al. (2018) propose that digital 
technologies in Industry 4.0 can unlock the potential of environmentally 
sustainable manufacturing. Therefore, digital technologies tend to pro-
mote environmental performance through developing eco-friendly 
products and enabling green manufacturing processes (Kiel et al., 
2017; Stock et al., 2018). The following hypothesis is then proposed: 


H1b. Digital technologies have a positive impact on environmental 
performance. 


3.2. The mediating role of digital supply chain platforms 


This study proposes that digital supply chain platforms mediate the 
impact of digital technologies on economic and environmental perfor-
mance in the Industry 4.0 era. Digital technologies, including the 
Internet of Things, cloud computing, big data and analytics, facilitate 
the technical establishment of digital supply chain platforms. In the era 
of Industry 4.0, manufacturing firms increasingly invest in digital 


technologies to develop their internal information-processing and 
decision-making capabilities. We argue that organizations’ internal ca-
pabilities are the premise and basis of the establishment of digital supply 
chain platforms. Digital supply chain platforms imply more extensive 
information sources and higher-order information processing capabil-
ities. Manufacturing firms can better coordinate information exchanges 
and transmissions with external suppliers and customers only when they 
are equipped with adequate internal information processing capabilities 
(Shou et al., 2017). Particularly, in a highly interconnected industrial 
network, firms take the initiative to extend digital technologies into the 
whole supply chain, from raw material provision to final product de-
livery, or they are compelled to apply digital technologies in supply 
chain activities to achieve compatibility with their suppliers and cus-
tomers. Otherwise, the firm can hardly survive in the intensely 
competitive marketplace. As Frank et al. (2019) find in a survey of 92 
manufacturing companies, digital platforms for integration with supply 
chain partners are adopted at a relatively high level in advanced 
adopters of digital manufacturing technologies. 


Because operations management and environmental management 
are both information-intensive activities (Lai et al., 2015; Addo--
Tenkorang and Helo, 2016), the achievement of economic and envi-
ronmental performance relies on sufficient information and adequate 
information processing capabilities to support product design, produc-
tion and delivery. From the perspective of IPT, supply chain platforms 
embedded with advanced digital technologies provide a channel to ex-
change high-quality information with suppliers, customers and other 
partners, thus satisfying the increasing demand for information pro-
cessing in the supply chain processes. Digital technology architectures 
targeted at the firm’s supply chain promote real-time information 
transmission, data integrity, visibility and connectivity between supply 
chain partners (Rai et al., 2006). Supply chain related information is 
recognized as being more beneficial for customer demand management, 
material supply and inventory management, and production optimiza-
tion and control (Qrunfleh and Tarafdar, 2014), which will potentially 
lead to economic and environmental performance. 


Several studies have documented the role of supply chain oriented 
efforts in the improvement of economic and environmental perfor-
mance. Wu et al. (2006) confirm that information flows facilitated by a 
digital supply chain system allow the firm to exactly match supply and 
demand and rapidly respond to customers’ requests, which ultimately 
increase sales and profitability. Prajogo and Olhager (2012) indicate 
that information technology-enabled supply chain platforms contribute 
to a decrease in production costs. Qrunfleh and Tarafdar (2014) also 
demonstrate that a supply chain information system strategy leads to 
economic performance. For environmental performance, Lai et al. 
(2015) find that environmental management information exchange with 
suppliers and customers can bring environmental performance. Jadhav 
et al. (2018) reveal the role of supply chain orientation in terms of 
communication in achieving environmental sustainability. Hence, we 
propose that digital supply chain platforms have a positive impact on 
economic and environmental performance. 


In sum, while the use of digital technologies enhances the organi-
zation’s internal information-processing and decision-making capabil-
ities, the establishment of digital supply chain platforms increases 
sources of high-quality information externally and further strengthens 
the capabilities by connecting suppliers and customers. Digital tech-
nologies enhance the speed, quality and quantity of information 
dissemination across the supply chain. Then, manufacturing firms can 
leverage both internal and external information to conduct operations 
and environmental management more efficiently and effectively. 
Furthermore, owing to the interconnectedness enabled by digital supply 
chain platforms, the once-isolated decision-making process is becoming 
more integrated from upstream suppliers to the downstream customers 
(Wu et al., 2006). In this case, digital technologies and supply chain 
platforms have potential synergistic benefits for the improvement of 
economic and environmental performance. Based on the above

discussions, we propose the following hypotheses: 


H2a. Digital supply chain platforms mediate the relationship between 
digital technologies and economic performance. 


H2b. Digital supply chain platforms mediate the relationship between 
digital technologies and environmental performance. 


3.3. The moderating role of environmental dynamism 


Environmental dynamism, which refers to the instability or volatility 
of a firm’s environment (Pagell and Krause, 2004), has been widely 
identified as a contextual factor in the fields of operations management 
(Sousa and Voss, 2008) and environmental management (Maleti"c et al., 
2018). Literature suggests that companies should design their organi-
zational structures based on the environment in which they compete to 
achieve high performance (Miller, 1987; Raymond, 2005; Sousa and 
Voss, 2008). Based on IPT, manufacturing firms in industrial environ-
ments with short product life cycles and frequent changes in demand, 
production and regulations are characterized by a high degree of 
dynamism (Bozarth et al., 2009; Azadegan et al., 2013; Chan et al., 
2016), leading to massive information-processing requirements (Mel-
ville and Ramirez, 2008). Therefore, firms are recommended to adapt 
their information technology infrastructures to maintain fit with their 
degree of environmental dynamism. 


Under a dynamic environment, manufacturing firms cannot solely 
rely on the data or information collected within the organizational 
boundary. They need to access more accurate and sufficient external 
information, thereby accurately predicting changes and reducing un-
certainty. Childerhouse et al. (2003) suggest that information flow needs 
to be transparent and two-way in supply chains (i.e., both upstream and 
downstream) to overcome environmental dynamism. In turn, inade-
quate information is regarded as a significant problem (Bailey and 
Francis, 2008) and will affect the organization’s decision-making abili-
ties (Boyle et al., 2008). Hence, when facing high levels of environ-
mental dynamism, the firm is more inclined to extend the application of 
digital technologies into supply chain processes to integrate information 
from upstream suppliers and downstream customers. Digital in-
frastructures incorporating supply chain partners can detect and 
monitor changes in the external environment more efficiently and 
effectively than those that do not. Therefore, we argue that 
manufacturing firms are more motivated to leverage digital technologies 
to establish supply chain platforms in a dynamic environment. 


The establishment of digital supply chain platforms can not only 
provide sources of external information but also further upgrade the 
manufacturing firm’s information processing capabilities so that 
manufacturing firms are able to respond to frequent and major changes 
in a timely manner. Competing in a dynamic environment, 
manufacturing firms tend to establish digital supply chain platforms to 
better support decision making for operations and environmental 
management. The enhanced information processing capabilities 
matched with higher information-processing requirements can ulti-
mately realize optimal performance. Therefore, as environmental 
dynamism grows, the effects of digital supply chain platforms on eco-
nomic and environmental performance will be much stronger. Previous 
studies have also found that environmental dynamism positively mod-
erates the effect of supply chain relationships on economic performance 
(Wong et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2017) and environmental performance 
(Wu, 2013), which supports the assertions made in this study. 


Overall, manufacturing firms are more likely to leverage digital 
technologies to establish supply chain platforms to achieve higher eco-
nomic and environmental performance in a dynamic environment. 
Considering the mediating role of digital supply chain platforms, this 
study highlights that the indirect effects of digital technologies on eco-
nomic and environmental performance through digital supply chain 
platforms will be enhanced as environmental dynamism grows. Thus, 
the following hypotheses are proposed in this study. Furthermore, a 


moderated mediation effect exists when a mediation process is depen-
dent on a moderating variable (Hayes, 2017; Yuan et al., 2020). Fig. 1 
presents the moderated meditation model of this study. 


H3a. Environment dynamism positively moderates the indirect effect 
of digital technologies on economic performance through digital supply 
chain platforms.

of digital technologies on environmental performance through digital 
supply chain platforms. 


4. Research methods 


4.1. Sampling and data collection 


This study conducted a questionnaire survey in China. The units of 
analysis were individual Chinese manufacturing firms, and the targeted 
respondents were middle- and senior-level managers. The survey 
comprised target sampling areas from northern China (e.g., Beijing, 
Tianjin, Hebei and Shanxi), southern China (e.g., Guangdong, Guangxi 
and Fujian), eastern China (e.g., Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Shandong 
and Anhui) and Western China (e.g., Sichuan, Yunnan, Chongqing and 
Shanxi). The manufacturing firms in these rapidly developing regions 
tend to apply digital technologies to achieve competitive advantages. 
We used the Yellow Pages of China Telecom to determine the potential 
sample pool (Jacobs et al., 2016) and to obtain the contact information 
of the firms in the target sampling areas. 


Following the proposed sampling procedure for questionnaire 
formatting, distribution, and collection (Dillman, 2007), we created an 
online survey, emailed the survey link to managers with high levels of 
experience in the selected sample firms, and promised to keep the data 
confidential. Follow-up telephone calls and two reminder emails were 
made to improve the response rate. To encourage participation in the 
surveys, the respondents were promised access to a summary of the 
research findings. In total, 5534 questionnaires were distributed, and 
188 useable responses were received. The response rate (3.4%) was 
comparable to the relevant research in similar nature (e.g., Jin et al., 
2014), considering the decreasing response level of the top managers 
and a large number of invalid email addresses. 


Table 1 provides the profiles of the respondents, which further 
demonstrates the representativeness of the sample. The respondents in 
our study included production managers (30.3%), R&D managers 
(17.6%), product managers (16.0%), marketing managers (14.4%), 
purchasing managers (6.4), plant managers (3.2%), CEOs (2.1%) and 
others (10.0%). A total of 92% had more than 5 years of work experi-
ence, indicating that they were knowledgeable in the application of 
digital technologies in product development and production and 
familiar with purchasing and supply chain management. Moreover, the 
sample covered a variety of manufacturing industries (e.g., chemicals 
and petrochemicals, electronics and electrical equipment, food, bever-
ages and alcohol) and different types of manufacturing firms (e.g.,

private, state-owned, foreign-owned and joint venture). In terms of firm 
size, 13.3% of the respondents came from firms with less than 100 
employees, 39.4% came from firms with between 101 and 500 em-
ployees, 33.5% came from firms with between 501 and 2000 employees, 
and 13.8% came from firms with over 2000 employees. Additionally, 
40.9% of the respondents’ firms had sales below CNY 5000 million, and 
the others had higher sales. Thus, the sample represented both large and 
small firms. 


4.2. Common method bias and non-response bias 


This study adopted both procedure and statistical methods to control 
the common method bias. With regard to the procedure remedies, we 
kept the questionnaire simple and specific, presented the measurement 
items for each construct in distinct sections, selected knowledgeable 
upper- and middle-level managers (over 90% of them with more than 5 
years of work experience) as respondents, and ensured the full protec-
tion of the respondents’ anonymity (Podsakoff et al., 2003). These 
procedures ensured that respondents could answer the questions care-
fully and honestly. Thus, we obtained reliable sources of information. 
Furthermore, we conducted Harman’s single factor test using CFA and 
EFA. The results of EFA show four distinct factors with eigenvalues 


above or near 1.0, explaining 65.82% of the total variance. The first 
extracted factor explained only 33.69% of the total variable (less than 40 
percent), which did not account for the majority of the variance. Then, 
CFA was also used by linking all items of the constructs to a single 
method factor. The fit indices (χ2/df ¼ 4.498, CFI ¼ 0.616, IFI ¼ 0.620, 
TLI ¼ 0.570, RMSEA ¼ 0.137 and SRMR ¼ 0.116) were obviously un-
acceptable and considerably worse than those of the measurement 
model (χ2/df ¼ 1.597, CFI ¼ 0.938, IFI ¼ 0.939, TLI ¼ 0.927, RMSEA ¼
0.057 and SRMR ¼ 0.059). Based on the above statistical examination, 
we concluded that common method bias was not a serious threat in this 
study. 


The non-response bias was assessed by comparing the difference 
between the responses from the early and late respondents (Armstrong 
and Overton, 1977). In this study, a t test on the number of employees 
and sales was compared between the early and late responses. The re-
sults showed no significant differences in the number of employees (t ¼
0.176, p ¼ 0.860) and sales (t ¼ "0.288, p ¼ 0.774), confirming that 
non-response bias was not a serious concern. 


4.3. Measures 


Measures for the relevant constructs in this study were adapted from 
established instruments in previous literature. Because the survey was 
conducted with Chinese respondents, a back-translation method was 
employed to ensure conceptual equivalence (Chan et al., 2016). The 
measures were then reviewed and revised by several experts in opera-
tions management. A focus group discussion and pilot test with 20 re-
spondents further helped to improve the measurement items to be more 
understandable and valid. Table 2 presents the constructs and mea-
surement items adopted in this study. We used 7-point Likert scales to 
measure all these items, with “1” representing “strongly disagree” to “7” 
representing “strongly agree”. 


The measures for digital technologies were adapted from Dalenogare 
et al. (2018), Mittal et al. (2018) and Frank et al. (2019), which include 
the Internet of Things, cloud computing, big data and analytics. In the 
era of Industry 4.0, these innovative technologies have been integrated 
and interconnected to realize a more coherent effect (Ivanov et al., 
2019). This implies that the items for digital technologies are highly 
correlated. Hence, our study applied a reflective model to measure 
digital technologies. The participants were asked to indicate the extent 
to which their firm has implemented digital technologies in their oper-
ations. Digital supply chain platforms refer to the platforms that pro-
mote interactions among supply chain partners (Rai et al., 2006; Reuver 
et al., 2018). We adopted the scale of Frank et al. (2019) to measure 
digital supply chain platforms, as shown in Table 2. The respondents 
were required to indicate the degree to which their firm has established 
digital platforms with suppliers, customers and other partners. 


Economic and environmental performance were assessed by asking 
the respondents to indicate the extent to which their firm’s performance 
has been achieved in the past three years. The measures for economic 
performance were adapted from Akter et al. (2016), Chan et al. (2016) 
and Schniederjans and Hales (2016), including growth in return on 
sales, growth in profit, growth in return on investment, growth in sales 
and growth in market share. Environmental performance was measured 
by four items adapted from Zhu et al. (2008), Schniederjans and Hales 
(2016) and Dubey et al. (2019). The items were reduction of air emis-
sion, reduction of wastewater, reduction of solid wastes and improve-
ment of the firm’s environmental situation. Although the self-reported 
perception measures of economic and environmental performance may 
be criticized as a limitation, Liu et al. (2016) note that these measures 
“have merits in soliciting the specificity for industry, time horizon, and 
economic (and environmental) conditions and thus facilitating com-
parisons across firms” (p. 18). The same measuring method has been 
commonly applied in the relevant research (e.g., Melnyk et al., 2003; 
Shashi et al., 2019). 


Environmental dynamism is defined as the instability or volatility of

a firm’s environment (Pagell and Krause, 2004). The scale to measure 
environmental dynamism was adapted from the literature of Bozarth 
et al. (2009), Azadegan et al. (2013), and Chan et al. (2016), including 
major changes in the modes of production and/or service provision, 
major changes in consumer demographics, frequent and major changes 
in government regulations, and short product life cycle. 


We also controlled for ownership type and firm size in terms of the 
number of employees and sales. Scholars have indicated that ownership 
type may influence supply chain activities and performance (Liu et al., 
2016; Amoako-Gyampah et al., 2019). This study used dummy variables 
for ownership types. Firm size has often been used as a control variable 
in previous studies. The larger firms are more likely to have adequate 
resources and capabilities to establish supply chain platforms and ach-
ieve a better performance than smaller firms (Shou et al., 2017). 


4.4. Reliability and validity 


This study conducted exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confir-
matory factor analysis (CFA) to evaluate the focal constructs’ reliability 
and validity. EFA was first carried out to examine construct unidimen-
sionality. The results indicated that all items have lower loadings on the 
irrelevant constructs and higher loadings on their corresponding 
construct. Cronbach’s α for each construct was then calculated. As 
shown in Table 2, all the values were greater than 0.75 (Fornell and 
Larcker, 1981), ranging from 0.771 to 0.843. Hence, the internal con-
sistency of the five constructs was ensured. 


We assessed the convergent validity and discriminant validity of our 
measures by conducting CFA with the maximum likelihood method. The 
indices for the CFA model, χ2/df ¼ 1.597, CFI ¼ 0.938, IFI ¼ 0.939, TLI 
¼ 0.927, RMSEA ¼ 0.057 and SRMR ¼ 0.059, indicated a reasonably 
high level of model fit (Hu and Bentler, 1999). Table 2 provides the 
values of the standardized factor loadings, composite reliability (CR) 
and average variance extracted (AVE). All factor loadings were greater 
than 0.50, ranging from 0.641 to 0.834. The estimates for CR were all 
higher than 0.70, ranging from 0.771 to 0.843. The AVE values were 
higher than 0.50 for four constructs in our study, while the AVE for 
environmental performance was 0.458, which is slightly below the 
suggested minimum (Fornell and Larcker, 1981). Considering that the 
values of the factor loadings, Cronbach’s α and CR for environmental 
performance satisfied the detailed criteria (O’Leary-Kelly and Vokurka, 
1998), we argue that the constructs had convergent validity. 


The discriminant validity was confirmed by comparing the square 
root of the AVE value for each construct with the correlations between 
the paired constructs (Fornell and Larcker, 1981). The results presented 
in Table 3 show that the square root of the AVE values on the diagonal 
were greater than the correlations between the respective construct and 
the other constructs. Therefore, discriminant validity was ensured in our 
study. 


5. Analyses and results 


This study used the PROCESS proposed by (Hayes, 2017) to validate 
the hypotheses. Some scholars, such as Preacher and Hayes (2004) and 
Zhao et al. (2010), have noted the potential shortcomings of the 
multistep regression approach (e.g., the type I error about the media-
tion) in Baron and Kenny (1986). MacKinnon et al. (2002) find that the 
method of Baron and Kenny (1986) may lead to low statistical power. 
Preacher and Hayes (2004) suggest a more powerful strategy test to 
estimate the size and significance of the effect and develop a SPSS macro 
program (i.e., PROCESS) that relies on a nonparametric bootstrapping 
procedure. PROCESS can assess a complex model including both medi-
ator and moderator variables and has been widely used in prior studies 
(e.g., Amoako-Gyampah et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2019; 
Yuan et al., 2020). Since a multiple regression analysis should be con-
ducted based on the PROCESS program, the variance inflation factor 
(VIF) was calculated for each model. The results showed that the VIF 
values ranged from 1.211 to 1.812, which is lower than the threshold 
value of 10, thus confirming that multi-collinearity was not a serious 
issue for this study. 


5.1. Hypothesis testing 


We first built the mediation model using “Model 4” in PROCESS, as 
shown in Fig. 2, to test Hypotheses 1a, 1b, 2a and 2b. Table 4 summa-
rizes the regression results. H1a and H1b examined the impact of digital 
technologies on economic and environmental performance. As shown in 
Table 4, controlling for the number of ownership types, employees and 
sales, digital technologies had a positive and significant impact on 
economic performance (c1’ ¼ 0.326, t ¼ 4.993) and environmental 
performance (c2’ ¼ 0.139, t ¼ 2.145). Thus, H1a and H1b were 
supported.

H2a and H2b examined the mediation effect of digital supply chain 
platforms on the relationship between economic performance and 
environmental performance. We tested the mediation effect using the 
bootstrapping application recommended by Hayes (2017). The results 
revealed that the path from digital technologies to digital supply chain 
platforms (a1 ¼ 0.587, t ¼ 9.944) was significant and positive, while the 
path from supply chain platforms to economic performance (b11 ¼
0.201, t ¼ 3.005) and environmental performance (b21 ¼ 0.154, t ¼
2.345) was also significant and positive. The bootstrapping with 5000 
resamples was executed to test the significance of the indirect effect of 
digital supply chain platforms. The results showed that the indirect ef-
fect of digital technologies on economic performance (indirect effect ¼


0.118, SE ¼ 0.053) and environmental performance (indirect effect ¼
0.090, SE ¼ 0.048) through digital supply chain performance was sig-
nificant. Moreover, the bias-corrected 95th percentile confidence in-
terval (CI) for the indirect effect on economic performance was [0.029, 
0.235] and that on environmental performance was [0.002, 0.193], 
which did not contain zero. Thus, both the direct and indirect effect of 
digital technologies on economic performance and environmental per-
formance were significant and positive, which indicated a partial 
mediation effect of digital supply chain platforms. Thus, H2a and H2b 
were supported in this study. 


Regarding Hypotheses 3a and 3b, we predicted that environmental 
dynamism positively moderates the indirect effect of digital technolo-
gies on economic and environmental performance through digital sup-
ply chain platforms. “Model 58” in PROCESS with a bootstrap analysis 
on 5000 resamples was therefore established, as shown in Fig. 3. The 
interaction effects between environmental dynamism and digital tech-
nologies on digital supply chain platforms and that between environ-
mental dynamism and digital supply chain platforms on economic and 
environmental performance were examined. Table 5 summarizes the 
regression results. The results indicated that the interaction term be-
tween digital technologies and environmental dynamism had a signifi-
cant and positive effect on digital supply chain platforms (a3 ¼ 0.124, t 
¼ 2.694) and that the interaction term between digital supply chain 
platforms and environmental dynamism had a significant and positive 
impact on economic performance (b13 ¼ 0.118, t ¼ 2.545) and envi-
ronmental performance (b23 ¼ 0.108, t ¼ 2.373). 


Table 6 summarizes the conditional indirect effect of digital tech-
nologies on economic and environmental performance through digital 
supply chain platforms. The results indicated that the conditional indi-
rect effect of digital technologies on economic performance was signif-
icant when environmental dynamism was high (95% CI ¼ [0.109, 
0.481]) but was insignificant when environmental dynamism was lower 
(95% CI ¼ [-0.024, 0.152]). Therefore, the mediation effect of digital 
supply chain platforms on the relationship between digital technologies 
and economic performance was stronger when environmental dyna-
mism was higher. Thus, H3a was supported. Similarly, the conditional 
indirect effect of digital technologies on environmental performance

was significant when environmental dynamism was high (95% CI ¼
[0.079, 0.403]) but was insignificant when environmental dynamism 
was lower (95% CI ¼ [-0.058, 0.113]). Hence, the mediation effect of 
digital supply chain platforms on the relationship between digital 
technologies and environmental performance was stronger when envi-
ronmental dynamism was higher. Thus, H3b was also supported in this 
study. 


5.2. Endogeneity 


Digital technologies may be endogenously influenced by the firm’s 
performance. To address the potential endogeneity bias, this study 
adopted the Hausman test, as suggested by Davidson and MacKinnon 
(1993). We first identified firm size in terms of the number of employees 
and sales as potential instrumental variables because these two variables 
were not significantly related to economic and environmental perfor-
mance (see Table 4) (Liu et al., 2016). Frank et al. (2019) note that large 
firms are more prepared for the adoption of advanced digital

technologies, which indicates that firm size influences digital technol-
ogies. Then, digital technologies were regressed on the assumed 
instrumental variables and control variables. The results indicated a 
significant relationship between the number of employees and digital 
technologies (β ¼ 0.199, t ¼ 2.227, p ¼ 0.027). Further, economic and 
environmental performance were regressed on the error term of digital 
technologies obtained from the first stage of regression, digital tech-
nologies and control variables. The error term was insignificantly 
related to economic performance (β ¼ 0.154, t ¼ 0.414, p ¼ 0.679) and 
environmental performance (β ¼ 0.504, t ¼ 1.240, p ¼ 0.216). Hence, 
we concluded that endogeneity was not an issue that impacted the 
findings of our study. 


6. Discussion and conclusions 


6.1. Theoretical implications 


This study empirically investigates how digital technologies in the 
context of Industry 4.0 influence economic and environmental perfor-
mance from the perspective of IPT. Based on a survey of Chinese 
manufacturing firms, the mediating effect of digital supply chain plat-
forms and the moderating effect of environmental dynamism are pro-
posed and investigated. The results contribute to relevant research on 
operations management and environmental management from four 
aspects. 


First, this study finds that digital technologies positively influence 
economic and environmental performance. In the context of Industry 
4.0, advanced digital technologies, including the Internet of Things, 
cloud computing, big data, and analytics, emerge and develop rapidly in 
a meaningful fashion. Although scholars have discussed the impact of a 
specific emerging digital technology on firms’ performance, such as the 
Internet of things (YU et al., 2015), big data analytics (Akter et al., 2016; 
Wamba et al., 2017; Dubey et al., 2019), cloud computing (Schnie-
derjans and Hales, 2016), and others (Dalenogare et al., 2018), 
manufacturing firms tend to integrate and configure these front-end 
technologies to establish a digitally enabled infrastructure, thus sup-
porting their operations and environmental management (Ivanov et al., 
2019). This study identifies the emerging advanced technologies as a 
unified construct that indicates the firm’s information processing ca-
pabilities and empirically investigates the coherent impact of advanced 
digital technologies on economic and environmental performance. The 
findings can help to better understand the integration of innovative and 
emerging digital technologies in the new era of Industry 4.0 and their 
coherent effect on firms’ sustainable development. 


In particular, previous studies have drawn inconsistent conclusions 
about the relationship between digital technologies and sustainability. 
On the one hand, scholars have recognized that digital technologies 


have the potential to facilitate product and operational performance 
(Dalenogare et al., 2018), environmental control and protection (Gobbo 
et al., 2018; Kamble et al., 2018), and environmentally sustainable 
manufacturing (Jabbour et al., 2018), which may lead to sustainability 
performance (Schniederjans and Hales, 2016; Dubey et al., 2019). 
However, these studies, especially those on environmental sustainabil-
ity, have been mostly based on qualitative reasoning. On the other hand, 
some previous studies have found that some digital technologies have a 
potential negative impact on product performance (Dalenogare et al., 
2018) and bring financial and environmental burdens (Kiel et al., 2017). 
We highlight that the relationships between digital technologies and 
sustainability performance have not been fully investigated. Jabbour 
et al. (2018) strongly recommend that future research develop the re-
lationships between digital technologies and sustainability and test the 
relationships through quantitative methods. Our study provides empir-
ical evidence for the relationship between the use of digital technologies 
and sustainability performance in the context of Industry 4.0, respond-
ing to the call of Jabbour et al. (2018). 


Second, our study confirms that the adoption of digital technologies 
facilitates the establishment of supply chain platforms in the era of In-
dustry 4.0. This assertion is consistent with those Jacobs et al. (2016) 
and Shou et al. (2017), who indicate that the firm’s internal communi-
cation and integration capabilities entail the exchange of real-time data 
and information across supply chains. Scholars have been attempting to 
establish the links between digital technologies and supply chain pro-
cesses through narrative literature review or exploratory case studies 
(Zhou et al., 2015; Addo-Tenkorang and Helo, 2016; Govindan et al., 
2018; Nguyen et al., 2018; Ben-Daya et al., 2019; Ivanov et al., 2019). 
The findings in this study provide empirical evidence for the links be-
tween digital technologies and supply chain platforms. 


Moreover, this study proposes and validates the mediating role of 
digital supply chain platforms, which serves as the underlying mecha-
nism to explain the relationship between digital technologies and sus-
tainability performance. The findings reveal that the effectiveness of 
digital technologies should be realized through the establishment of 
digital supply chain platforms. Some studies have discussed the medi-
ating role of supply chain activities in the relationship between tradi-
tional information technology and performance (e.g., Wu et al., 2006). 
However, in the context of Industry 4.0, few studies have empirically 
explored how supply chain platforms mediate the effect of advanced 
digital technologies on sustainability performance. The study of Camara 
et al. (2015) is rare in that it indicates that the impact of cloud 
computing on operational performance requires the mediating support 
of supply chain integration. In this study, the mediation effect of digital 
supply chain platforms implies that incorporating proper mediators can 
help better explain the impact of digital technologies on economic and 
environmental performance. 


Third, our study reveals that environmental dynamism moderates 
the indirect effect of digital technologies for Industry 4.0 on economic 
and environmental performance through digital supply chain platforms. 
To the best of our knowledge, there is limited empirical research 
examining the moderating factors in the field of digital technologies for 
Industry 4.0. Our study indicates that, particularly in a dynamic envi-
ronment, manufacturing firms should not only rely on internal infor-
mation processing capabilities by use of digital technologies but also 
need to make the utmost digital supply chain platforms access more 
sufficient information externally, thereby realizing higher economic and 
environmental performance. In other words, digital technologies and 
supply chain platforms play a more crucial role in the dynamic envi-
ronment. These findings can further contribute to the understanding of 
the contextual conditions to develop and apply digital technologies and 
supply chain platforms. 


Last but not least, based on the IPT (Galbraith, 1973; Tushman and 
Nadler, 1978), this study identifies the application of digital platforms as 
the organization’s information processing capabilities and digital supply 
chain platforms as information exchange channels with upstream

suppliers, downstream customers and other partners. The findings sup-
port IPT by confirming that information processing capabilities and high 
information quality contribute to performance (Premkumar et al., 
2005). Moreover, environmental conditions determine the requirements 
for informational processing capabilities and information quality (Mel-
ville and Ramirez, 2008; Chan et al., 2016). The moderating effect of 
environmental dynamisms implies that manufacturing firms should ac-
cess sufficient information internally and externally and enhance their 
information processing capabilities to match their high levels of 
information-processing requirements. The effect of fit between infor-
mation processing capabilities and requirements is therefore demon-
strated in this study. Overall, the empirical findings are consistent with 
the IPT perspective, suggesting that IPT is a useful way to characterize 
both the effects and contextual conditions of digital technologies for 
Industry 4.0 and digital supply chain platforms. 


6.2. Managerial implications 


The findings in our study also provide some managerial insights for 
manufacturing firms. In the era of Industry 4.0, front-end technologies 
such as the Internet of Things, cloud computing, big data and analytics 
have been adopted to gain competitive advantages (Dalenogare et al., 
2018). To promote sustainable development, manufacturing firms are 
recommended to use these digital technologies to enhance their eco-
nomic and environmental sustainability. It should be recognized that 
operations and environmental management activities in the present 
business environment are highly information-intensive. Firms that 
obtain accurate and real-time information can thus have superiority in 
competition. The adoption of digital technologies for Industry 4.0 is 
primarily for collecting and processing information related to products 
and production, thereby supporting decision making effectively and 
efficiently. A digitally enabled technology infrastructure will be a 
necessary choice for manufacturing firms to obtain the success of both 
operations and environmental management. 


The findings further reveal that manufacturing firms should extend 
their use of digital technologies into supply chain processes and estab-
lish digital supply chain platforms with upstream suppliers, downstream 
customers and other partners. Previous studies have highlighted the 
significance of supply chain relationships in achieving sustainability 
(Jadhav et al., 2018). Our study emphasizes that in the era of Industry 
4.0, digital supply chain platforms still matter much to the improvement 
of economic and environmental sustainability. In particular, managers 
need to recognize the crucial role of supply chain platforms in realizing 
the value of digital resources when firms compete in a highly dynamic 
environment that is characterized by frequent and rapid changes in 
customer demand, production modes and government regulations. In 
sum, for sustainable development, firms should not only apply digital 
technologies within organizational boundaries but also establish digi-
tally enabled platforms across supply chains. 


6.3. Limitations and future research 


Although the findings provide theoretical and managerial insights 
for researchers and practitioners, there are still several limitations in this 
study that also direct future research. First, we focus on economic and 
environmental performance, which are two dimensions of sustainability 
performance. Prior studies suggest a “triple bottom line” perspective to 
capture sustainability (Kamble et al., 2018). Hence, we recommend 
including the social dimension of sustainability to fully explore the 
relationship between digital technologies for Industry 4.0 and sustain-
ability performance. Second, in this study, we refer digital technologies 
to the Internet of Things, cloud computing, big data and analytics. We 
recognize these innovative technologies are integrated and inter-
connected in the era of Industry 4.0 thus a reflective model is used to 
measure digital technologies. In the future, with the growing new digital 
technologies, some of which might not naturally integrated or 


interconnected, thus a formative model to measure digital technologies 
might needed. Lastly, to test the proposed hypotheses, this study con-
ducted a survey in China, which is regarded as an emerging market. In 
recent years, Industry 4.0 technologies have been widely adopted and 
well developed in the Chinese manufacturing industry. Future research 
may test the model in developed markets to compare the potential dif-
ferences in the application of digital technologies and supply chain 
platforms.
