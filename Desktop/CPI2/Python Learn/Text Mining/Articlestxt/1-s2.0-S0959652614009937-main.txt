The industrial sector consumed about 19% of the total societal
energy and contributed 30% of the total global greenhouse gas
(GHS) emissions in 2010 based on a recent report from the Inter-
governmental Panel on Climate Change report (IPCC, 2014; Baj�zelj
et al., 2013). Manufacturing is responsible for about 98% of the total
direct CO2 emissions from the industrial sector (IEA, 2012a, 2012b).
Finding better ways to reduce energy consumption andwaste emis-
sions in manufacturing processes is therefore, critical to achieving
energy savings and emissions reductions. This is essential to
enhance the sustainability of our society. Additionally, the IPCC
report highlighted that the lack of acceptance of unconventional
advanced manufacturing processes, is a major barrier for reducing
energy consumption and emissions.


Advanced manufacturing focuses on the coordination of informa-
tion, automation, computation, software, sensing, and networking
in manufacturing (PCAST, 2011). Advancedmanufacturing uses cut-
ting edge materials and emerging technologies (e.g., additive
manufacturing and digital manufacturing) and is expected to be
crucial not only for the economic competitiveness of manufacturers
at a global scope but also for the sustainability of the industrial
sector. The digital manufacturing and additive processes reduce
manufacturing material's wastes compared to traditional subtrac-
tive manufacturing and avoid producing products for which there
is no customer.


In the whole life-cycle of products, the manufacturing process is
one of the most energy consumptive and waste emissions produc-
ing segments. New materials and technologies of advanced
manufacturing require new manufacturing processes and new
analytical and simulation models for process controls and param-
eter optimization with regard to cost, quality, product flexibility,
energy consumption, and fossil carbon emission reductions.
Those new processes are expected to fundamentally transform
manufacturing systems, including facility design, process planning,
scheduling, material handling, workforce planning, quality control,

and inventory management. Furthermore, the effectiveness of
adopting advanced manufacturing can only be maximized by
following a holistic systems approach from product conceptualiza-
tion, product design and manufacturing to product delivery and
service for the customers as well as in the management of the
used products at the end of their useful lifetimes. This will require
innovations and improvements in forward and reverse supply
chain management, which are designed to catalyze system's
changes from labor-intensive and capital-intensive traditional
manufacturing to information-based advanced manufacturing.


The trend of advanced manufacturing coincides with the accel-
eration of innovations in global supply-chain management. New
materials and processes require new supply chain designs and op-
erations. Supply-chain networks and mechanisms should be re-
tuned to further encourage information sharing among enterprises
to make manufacturing processes more distributed, decentralized
and collaborative. Very soon, advanced manufacturing will become
increasingly globally linked as digital supply-chain management
evolves and becomes the norm across enterprise systems (IDA,
2012). Additionally, wide adoption of advanced manufacturing
could make supply chains more responsive and cost efficient.
Rather than shipping physical products, designs could be shared
digitally so that large amounts of energy consumption and emis-
sions during freight transport could be saved. Additive
manufacturing could significantly reduce the lead-time for obtain-
ing products and parts with high customization and great variety
and therefore facilitate just-in-time or nearly just-in-time systems,
which can reduce inventory levels and supply chain risks. The
resultant flexibility brought by advanced manufacturing will help
to tailor supply chains to respond to fast-evolving and more
personalized customer needs. The interactions between advanced
manufacturing and supply-chain management needs to be
researched together in order to achieve optimal sustainability
benefits.


In order to fully understand and maximize the potential of
advanced manufacturing to save energy and resources, systematic
approaches, which consider all stages of product life-cycles, multi-
ple functions within enterprises, and supply-chain management
across enterprises is necessary. This Special Volume (SV) of the

Journal of Cleaner Production (JCLP) was designed to enhance and
to promote societal sustainability and the low-fossil carbon econ-
omy, which can result from integration of advanced manufacturing
at all stages along product life cycles, including design, process,
planning, supply chain management, delivery, and service. The
Guest Editors (GEs) welcome literature reviews, research papers,
and case studies that include but are not restricted to the following
topics.


Theme 1: design theory and methodology for sustainability
with advanced manufacturing


Considering environmental factors and other externalities in
developing new technical products and systems is critical for the
sustainability of advanced manufacturing (Waage, 2007; Maxwell
and Van der Vorst, 2003). This task is inherently challenging
because the traditional starting point of product design is based
upon customer requirements without considering environmental
requirements. During the past decade there has been dramatic
growth in environment-considered design, such as eco-design,
design for environment, and design for sustainability (Bovea and
P�erez-Belis, 2012). The base of engineering design has been
extended to cover environmental factors (Mont, 2002), such as
generalized function definitions instead of technical function defi-
nitions. However, there is still a lack of practical design methods for
directly guiding product design using both customer and environ-
mental requirements as starting points. Topics of interest in this
theme include but are not limited to:


� Assessing affordability-based design methodologies that
consider environmental factors for advanced manufacturing;


� Designing and applying decision-support models, which
consider environmental requirements in supply chains;


� Incorporating environmental requirement modeling, elicitation
and evaluation in engineering design;


� Incorporating of uncertainty in analyzing environmental
requirements;


� Implementing environmentally friendly innovative design;
� Integrating systematic approaches for meeting customer's
needs and environmental requirements;


� Implementing design for diverse customer usage requirements;
� Implementing design for remanufacturing, recycling and
recovery.

Theme 2: energy efficiency assessment and control of
mechanical manufacturing systems


The traditional mechanical manufacturing systems (MMS) use
enormous amounts of energy throughout many industrial sectors
while their efficiency is very low (Wang et al., 2013). As a result,
it is imperative to improve energy efficiency in MMS (Duflou
et al., 2012; Salonitis and Ball, 2013). Improved energy efficiency
assessment, control and better management are required for
improving energy efficiency formanufacturing processes, including
advanced manufacturing. However, the energy consumption of a
manufacturing system has a series of characteristics, such as a large
number of energy sources, complex energy flows, huge dynamic
changes and diverse impacts. As a result, it is challenging to eval-
uate, manage and ensure improvements in energy efficiency.
Consequently, innovative and practical assessment and control
methods are urgently needed. The emerging and rapidly-
developing advanced manufacturing approaches lack energy effi-
ciency assessment methods. For this reason, authors are invited
to submit papers about energy efficiency assessment and control,

especially for advanced manufacturing. Topics of interest in this
theme include but are not limited to:


� Improving energy-efficiency in MMS with advanced
manufacturing processes;


� Developing, testing and implementation an effective index
systems for energy efficiency evaluation;


� Implementing real-time energy efficiency assessment of com-
ponents and systems;


� Integrating online acquisition of energy efficiency data with
system's feedback learning loops;


� Establishing and monitoring progress in achieving energy con-
sumption and energy efficiency improvement quotas or targets
in manufacturing processes.

Theme 3: parameter optimization for advanced
manufacturing and remanufacturing


Within this theme the SV team welcomes papers, which apply
optimization techniques using resource, cost and performance as
objectives to achieve evidence-based resource/cost/performance
trade-off analyses of advanced manufacturing processes. This
theme will also focus on three inter-connected components for
remanufacturing. 1) The parameters used in novel process technol-
ogies for transforming scrap are optimized to maximize the quan-
tity and quality of material recovery with minimum resources
and costs. 2) The parameters of the remanufacturing processes
are optimized to ensure quality assurance of remanufactured prod-
ucts. 3) The design and re-manufacturing processes of the re-
manufactured products are considered concurrently to maximize
energy and material's efficiency. Topics of interest in this theme
include but are not limited to:


� Optimizing the design and advanced manufacturing processes
for optimizing energy and material's efficiency;


� Optimizing process technologies for transforming scrap into
reusable raw materials;


� Optimizing remanufacturing processes;
� Optimizing techniques for low fossil-carbon and sustainability
applications;


� Testing, improving and implementing decision-support systems
for evidence-based resource/cost/performance trade-off ana-
lyses of advanced manufacturing and remanufacturing;


� Developing in-depth case studies on manufacturing process
optimization for low fossil-carbon and sustainability
applications.

Theme 4: low fossil-carbon process planning and production
scheduling


Process planning and production scheduling, which link product
design andmanufacturing, are two of the most important functions
in modern manufacturing processes. A process plan specifies what
manufacturing resources and technical operations/routes are
needed to produce a product. With the process plans of jobs as in-
puts, a production task is required to effectively schedule the oper-
ations of all jobs on machines without violating the job precedence
relationships specified in the process plans. Both impact the perfor-
mance of the modern manufacturing system, especially in energy
consumption and production of waste emissions. In recent decades,
many research publications have dealt with these functions. How-
ever, few authors simultaneously considered low fossil-carbon and
sustainability (Shrouf et al., 2014; Kant and Sangwan, 2014).






Call for papers / Journal of Cleaner Production 87 (2015) 7e10 9

Advanced manufacturing often involves new materials and
manufacturing processes and requires new models for planning
and scheduling but not low fossil-carbon and sustainability. There-
fore, topics of interest within this theme include but are not limited
to:


� Optimizing process planning and process scheduling for
advanced manufacturing, especially in the context of low fossil-
carbon and sustainability dimensions;


� Optimizing manufacturing systems under multiple sustainabil-
ity criteria, such as economic feasibility, fossil-carbon emissions,
and energy consumption;


� Monitoring and reducing the fossil-carbon energy footprints in
advanced manufacturing process planning and production
scheduling.

Theme 5: integration of supply-chain innovations and
advanced manufacturing


Supply chain innovations, such as enterprise resource planning,
electronic data exchange, and the adoption of the radio frequency
identification (RFID) in logistics, have contributed to the complexity
and globalization of the current economy (Zelbst et al., 2010).
Advanced manufacturing is expected not only to change processes
within a single enterprise but also to transform supply chains
across global enterprises. The distributed manufacturing processes
could significantly reduce the physical flows of products, which
cause massive energy consumption and fossil-carbon emissions
in freight transportation. The reduced procurement lead times
and higher flexibility provided by advanced manufacturing can
help supply chain managers to reduce inventory levels while
providing high responsiveness to their customer needs. The rapid
delivery provided by advanced manufacturing could also improve
the robustness of supply chains to respond to disruptions. All of
these fundamental changes require systematic investigations into
the interactions between supply-chain innovations and advanced
manufacturing (IDA, 2012). Topics of interest in this theme include
but are not limited to:


� Developing, testing and applying new analytical and simulation
models for supply-chain network design, management, and
coordination for advanced manufacturing;


� Documenting the impacts of advanced manufacturing on lo-
gistics management;


� Integrating models for real-time optimization of advanced
manufacturing processes and their associated supply chains to
optimize their economic, human health and environmental
sustainability benefits.

Theme 6: sustainable innovation for product-service systems


Manufacturers are increasingly becoming service providers and
some of them have successfully gained environmental and financial
benefits from their product-service operations. Thus, the concept
named Product-Service Systems (PSS) has received increased atten-
tion. The goal of PSS is to offer customers with “physical products
and/or services”, which can reach environment optimization, en-
ergy saving and value-added services. Sustainable innovation for
PSS takes all aspects of sustainable development into account, in
particular the environmental, economic, and social factors. It is
necessary to perform research on how to develop, implement and
monitor sustainable models for PSS, and on how sustainable design
methods and tools can be integrated into PSS to deliver

sustainability. Advanced manufacturing may bring the service level
of PSS to new dimensions and create additional values to customers
and to the companies. Topics of interest in this theme include but
are not limited to:


� Developing, implementing and monitoring modular develop-
ment processes, methods and platforms for PSS toward
sustainability;


� Achieving greater sustainability through PSS, which benefit
from a thorough application of sustainable design processes and
toolkits;


� Engaging in business modeling, organizational modeling, and
operational mechanism construction to support the integration
of PSS;


� Determining the economic aspects of PSS by utilizing total cost
accounting and other tools to determine the costs and benefits
of different types of PSS;


� Integrating PSS knowledge management to better explore how
knowledge can be generated and used for enhancing the quality
of decision-making processes.
