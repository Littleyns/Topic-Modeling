Sustainable Development Goals present an opportunity for industries to (re)design their supply chains. It is 
understood that digital technologies like blockchain can be helpful in achieving certain Sustainable Development 
Goals linked to livelihoods, food security, and the environment, by identifying issues and implementing inter-
ventions in real-time. However, there is limited understanding over data structure requirements for blockchain 
technology implementation in digitally-enabled food supply chains. Therefore, this research studies the design of 
blockchain-centric food supply chains that promote Sustainable Development Goals, within the context of the 
Thai fish industry. Key findings suggest that data asymmetry exists in supply chains to achieve Sustainable 
Development Goals. This research presents four design principles and an integrated technology implementation 
framework, derived from empirical data, for blockchain-centric food supply chains. The research outcome 
contributes to the supply chain management field and could ultimately impact the resilience of fishery eco-
systems and the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals.   


1. Introduction 


Digitalisation in the manufacturing sector unveils the potential to 
capture Big Data from an end-to-end manufacturing network perspec-
tive and drive operational improvements (Tiwari, Wee, & Daryanto, 
2018). However, applications that entail the management of huge da-
tasets encounter several challenges that mainly relate to the limited 
processing capability of incomplete, unstructured, and inaccurate data 
(Choi, Guo, & Luo, 2020). To that end, blockchain technology, a de-
centralised ledger which facilitates transactions of cryptographed data 
in blocks, has attracted increased academic and business interest as it 
enables authentication, auditability, and confidentiality of transmitted 
data and information (Lin, He, Huang, Choo, & Vasilakos, 2018). In a 
supply chain operations management context, blockchain has great 
implementation potential as it can facilitate complex interactions 
among network stakeholders and address the issue of data incon-
sistencies (Min, 2019). Business reports indicate that about 62% of 
supply chain executives have engaged with blockchain (Garner, 2018), 
while the expected business value added by this Industry 4.0 con-
stituent technology is projected to exceed US$3.1 trillion by 2030 


(Furlonger & Valdes, 2017). 
A range of fraud vulnerabilities and counterfeiting issues are iden-


tified in food supply chains (van Ruth, Luning, Silvis, Yang, & Huisman, 
2018), which motivate promising experimental applications of block-
chain technology in the food and agriculture industries (Kshetri, 2018). 
In particular, the food industry highly appreciates the food safety and 
transparency benefits emanating from potential implementations of 
blockchain as the technology enables efficient data capture, manage-
ment and control (Bumblauskas, Mann, Dugan, & Rittmer, 2020). 
However, the extant body of literature is fragmented as the majority of 
the related research studies myopically focuses on the transparency and 
traceability benefits of blockchain in supply networks rather than spe-
cific design interventions that deliver such benefits. The sustainability 
implications of blockchain pose an emerging topic in the supply chain 
management research agenda (Saberi, Kouhizadeh, Sarkis, & Shen, 
2019), while the sparsity of relevant studies on food chains motivates 
research in the field (Feng, Wang, Duan, Zhang, & Zhang, 2020). To a 
greater extent, Hughes et al. (2019) declared the potential of block-
chain to contribute to a range of the United Nations Sustainable De-
velopment Goals (SDGs) via articulating a number of research

propositions; however, the authors’ recommendations are not industry 
or use case specific. Notably, the authors did not investigate the role of 
blockchain towards promoting particular SDGs but rather claimed that 
the blockchain-targeted propositions can be valid in case specific SDGs 
are realised. Therefore, the lack of studies exploring the role of block-
chain in promoting SDGs, especially with an emphasis on the food in-
dustry, constitutes an evident gap in the pertinent literature. 


Notwithstanding the proclaimed traceability, transparency, and 
sustainability benefits of blockchain in global supply networks (Saberi 
et al., 2019), the technology has not yet been applied on real-world end- 
to-end network applications (Dallasega & Sarkis, 2018). The most sig-
nificant challenge that hinders blockchain implementation for value 
creation relates to high-level collaboration requirements (Kittipanya- 
ngam & Tan, 2020), along with inconsistencies in data structures across 
the distributed data sources (Muzammal, Qu, & Nasrulin, 2019). 
However, unless data elements and their structure integrate across end- 
to-end networks, the value of information flows that could fuel per-
formance improvements in supply chain operations is not realised 
(Gavirneni, Kapuscinski, & Tayur, 1999) while the supply chain ma-
turity process stagnates (Trkman, Štemberger, Jaklič, & Groznik, 2007). 


Blockchain along with Big Data can expedite Industry 4.0 ad-
vancements in food value chain management (Zhao et al., 2019). 
However, motivated by the evident paucity of studies exploring the 
usability of blockchain in real-world contexts (Zhao et al., 2019), this 
research argues that blockchain implementation is not understood from 
the perspective of supply chain (re)design. From an academic per-
spective, Treiblmaier (2018) provided a framework linking blockchain 
attributes to the characteristics of four supply chain management-cen-
tric theories, but the provided conceptual construct considered block-
chain in a broader sense and did not identify data structure require-
ments as a distinctive blockchain attribute that can foster the 
technology’s implementation. From a technical viewpoint, the sustain-
able food supply chain literature lacks application frameworks that can 
contribute to information visibility in data-driven environments 
(Kamble, Gunasekaran, & Gawankar, 2020), while the operability of 
typical assets and transaction data in blockchain applications (e.g., 
business documents, images) is disregarded (Kumar, Liu, & Shan, 
2020). Considering that blockchain technology in sustainable food 
supply networks is a nascent, yet unexplored, research field with un-
determined real-world challenges (Kamble, Gunasekaran, & Arha, 
2019), this study bridges this gap by attempting to answer the following 
research question: How can blockchain-centric supply chains be de-
signed and managed in the food industry in order to achieve SDGs? 


It is essential to tackle the abovementioned research question to 
operationalise blockchain technology for delivering sustainable value 
networks (Capgemini Research Institute, 2018). More specifically, to 
address the research question, this study focused on empirically derived 
value chain effectuation by identifying necessary Key Data Elements 
and via proposing a framework for the implementation of blockchain in 
food supply network designs, particularly focusing on the Thai fish 
industry. The limited number of relevant research studies provides 
high-level discussions over the sustainability benefits of blockchain in 
fish supply chain management (Howson, 2020), while overlooking 
data-related implementation aspects of the technology at an operational 
level. Therefore, to tackle the research question, this study further de-
veloped four principles for blockchain-centric food supply chain designs 
to contribute to SDGs. 


The research emphasis on the fish industry was stimulated by a 
range of reasons, including (Gopi, Mazumder, Sammut, & Saintilan, 
2019): (i) global increasing demand on seafood; (ii) essential nutritional 
role of fish to human diets; (iii) significance of the seafood market to 
national economies and global trade; and (iv) increasing global con-
cerns over fish provenance and authenticity, mainly in terms of food 
safety, quality, and fraud. In particular, sustainable fisheries manage-
ment in Thailand is crucial owing to the significance of the seafood 
sector to the national economy. Based on the National Food Institute, 


Thailand is the leading global producer and exporter of canned tuna 
with a market share of about 40% (Kittipanya-ngam & Tan, 2020). 
However, the Thai fish industry encounters major sustainability chal-
lenges including illegal fishing activities amounting to financial losses 
of about US$5 billion (Wipatayotin, 2019), and unethical labour prac-
tices (Sasipornkarn, 2019). Therefore, Thailand’s food supply chains 
need to continuously demonstrate efficiency and sustainability to 
maintain the leadership position in global exports. 


This research employed a multiple case study approach, involving 
data and information collection from both interviews with stakeholders 
and field observations, to answer the enunciated research query. More 
specifically, three case studies were conducted within the context of the 
Thai fish industry via leveraging three data and information collection 
mechanisms – semi-structured interviews, field observations, official 
documentation of supply chain operations – to identify data sources, 
ensure data validity, and generate insights (McCutcheon & Meredith, 
1993). The paradigm of the Thai fish industry aligns with the SDGs and 
helps link blockchain implementation requirements to supply chain 
design. To the best of our knowledge, no peer-reviewed research article 
on blockchain technology in end-to-end fish supply chains has com-
bined literature analysis and empirical evidence. 


Our research contributes to the Operations Management field by 
applying a multiple case study approach to develop a pragmatic view of 
traceability in blockchain enabled fish supply chains. In addition, this 
research studies the relationship between blockchain technology and 
supply chain design within the prospect of product traceability. 


The remainder of this research is structured as follows. Section 2 
summarises indicative studies examining blockchain in the food industry 
and provides the research background of blockchain implementation and 
supply chain design. Section 3 details the research methodology applied to 
gather and analyse evidence on the application of blockchain technology 
in the fish industry. Section 4 investigates the fishery ecosystem in Thai-
land. An integrated framework capturing supply chain (re)design im-
plications stemming from the implementation of blockchain technology is 
proposed in Section 5. Critical evaluation of the research findings along 
with academic and management implications, limitations, and future re-
search avenues, are explored in the final Section 6. 


2. Research background 


Key studies discussing blockchain in end-to-end food supply net-
works were reviewed followed by an investigation of pertinent extant 
works focusing on the fish industry and on sustainability implications. 
Additionally, major literature evidence on the design of technology- 
enabled supply networks was retrieved. 


2.1. Blockchain in food supply networks 


Blockchain technology’s expected benefits are clearly documented 
for the food industry, mainly referring to advanced traceability cap-
abilities and increased food safety leading to enhanced consumers’ 
trust. In addition, blockchain could help mitigate the ripple effect that 
describes the propagation of any risks downstream a food supply chain, 
hence further impacting a network’s structural design and planning 
parameters (Dolgui, Ivanov, & Sokolov, 2018). 


Key studies investigating the potential application and im-
plementation of blockchain within a food supply network context were 
recognised and taxonomised as part of this research; an exhaustive re-
view of all research works in the field extends the current research 
scope. Most recently published review articles on the topic indicatively 
include the studies of Antonucci et al. (2019), Kamble et al. (2020), and  
Lezoche, Panetto, Kacprzyk, Hernandez, and Alemany Díaz (2020). 


2.1.1. End-to-end food chains 
Crew (2018a,b) discussed the role of blockchain in enhancing con-


sumers’ trust and food safety as the technology enables transparency, 


N. Tsolakis, et al.   


































tracking, and traceability in transactions among end-to-end food supply 
network stakeholders. Notwithstanding the conceptual discussions in 
the domain, the need for feasible food traceability systems led Behnke 
and Janssen (2020) to investigate four dairy supply chain processes and 
identify five boundary conditions (recognised across the business, 
quality, and traceability categories) for the implementation of block-
chain technology. In a similar vein, Chen, Liu, Yan, Hu, and Shi (2020) 
performed a thematic analysis of news articles and research studies 
jointly discussing blockchain and food networks, while the authors 
identified processes, benefits, and challenges prevalent in the adoption 
of the technology in food supply chains. 


Furthermore, Kim and Laskowski (2018) developed a proof-of- 
concept ontology-based blockchain and investigated the feasibility of a 
traceability ontology for food supply chain provenance. Marfia and 
Degli Esposti (2017) considered blockchain for the case of organic 
farming to guarantee trust and increase product value. Similarly,  
Mondal et al. (2019) implemented a blockchain architecture enabled by 
a Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) sensor to develop a tamper- 
proof digital database of food packages. 


Sander, Semeijn, and Mahr (2018) surveyed the perceptions of meat 
supply chain stakeholders about blockchain, as a viable meat trans-
parency and traceability system, and concluded that the technology 
could positively influence consumers’ purchasing decisions in case trust 
towards blockchain is established. In cold food supply chains, block-
chain is highly appreciated as the technology can promote transparency 
of temperature information about food products, particularly during 
storage and distribution, thus supporting waste mitigation (Ndraha, 
Hsiao, Vlajic, Yang, & Lin, 2018). Additionally, Tian (2017) con-
ceptually investigated the architecture of a food supply chain trace-
ability system enabled by HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control 
Points), blockchain, and Internet of Things, as a solution to support 
food safety and consumers’ trust in the industry. 


On a more pragmatic basis, Kamilaris, Fonts, and Prenafeta-Boldύ 
(2019) reviewed ongoing initiatives and projects on blockchain tech-
nology in agriculture and food supply networks, and further discussed 
related implications, benefits, and challenges. Indicatively, Walmart 
leads an initiative along with Nestlé SA, Unilever NV and other global 
companies to develop the Food Trust blockchain with the aim to trace 
and manage potential risks across end-to-end food supply chains (Nash, 
2018). Likewise, Pendrous (2017) discussed trends and business in-
itiatives (e.g., the joint initiative by Arc-net and PwC Netherlands) re-
garding the development of a blockchain-based platform across food 
supply networks to deliver product safety, quality and integrity. 


2.1.2. Fish industry 
From a fish supply chain operational perspective, Cook (2018) re-


ported the benefits and challenges of a related pilot project on block-
chain implementation, led by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), 
particularly focusing on tuna caught in a Fijian longline fishery. Fur-
thermore, Intel applied its proprietary open source blockchain platform, 
named Hyperledger Sawtooth, to enable seafood traceability and ensure 
compliance with storage conditions across fish supply chains (del 
Castillo, 2017). Fishcoin, a blockchain-based data ecosystem dedicated 
to the seafood industry, utilises tokens for incentivising data capture 
and transmission across fish supply chains in order to increase trace-
ability (Fishcoin, 2018). 


In addition, the social enterprise Project Provenance Ltd tested a 
prototype blockchain model to track and trace responsibly caught tuna 
fish in Indonesia by gathering diversified data across operations, from 
vessel tracking and registration to self-reporting of fish catch and fish 
tagging (Provenance, 2016). Moreover, WWF piloted the use of block-
chain technology in the Pacific tuna industry to trace fish provenance, 
track illegal fishing instances, and eliminate abuses of human rights 
(WWF, 2018). Visser and Hanich (2018) discussed the transparency and 
traceability benefits of blockchain in aforementioned real-world pilot 
implementations, further highlighting the technology’s contribution in 


tackling poor human working conditions in low-income countries. From 
a fish supply chain management perspective, Mathisen (2018) in-
vestigated the strategic compliance of blockchain technology to Nor-
wegian aquaculture producers and discussed potential benefits with 
regard to the expected efficiency in terms of quality, cost, sustainability, 
and dependability. 


2.1.3. Sustainability 
In terms of sustainability, Ahmed and Broek (2017) summarised the 


potential food security benefits stemming from the adoption of block-
chain technology in food supply networks, particularly stressing the 
emanating possibilities of distributing surplus food supplies to bene-
ficiary bodies and enhancing the visibility over the environmental 
footprint of commodities/products. Chapron (2017) critically discussed 
governance and sustainability benefits stemming from the im-
plementation of blockchain technology in manufacturing and food 
supply chain operations and particularly highlighted the associated 
potential of natural resources stewardship along with social sustain-
ability implications. Moreover, Lin et al. (2017) discussed the evolu-
tionary role of blockchain in agriculture to enable efficient water 
quality monitoring in farms. 


In a humanitarian context, Juskalian (2018) presented the case of 
the “Building Blocks” initiative, set by the World Food Programme of 
the United Nations, which uses blockchain technology and iris scanning 
technology to allow refugees in Jordan to purchase daily grocery sup-
plies. The author also discussed the efficiency gains deriving from the 
adoption of blockchain for humanitarian operations, including: (i) re-
duced bank fees applicable to transfers of humanitarian aid funds; (ii) 
digital proof of refugees’ identity and educational/employment history 
that increases employment opportunities in hosting countries; and (iii) 
enhanced efficiency of humanitarian aid operations deployed by in-
ternational organisations. 


2.1.4. Critical taxonomy 
A critical taxonomy of the reviewed literature on blockchain tech-


nology in food supply chains is presented in Table 1. The taxonomy 
reveals that most of the studies published in peer-reviewed scientific 
journals are limited on a discussion of potential benefits and challenges 
related to the adoption of blockchain technology in food supply net-
works. Few studies, mainly retrieved from grey literature, focus on real- 
world implementation cases while no articles highlight the role of data 
structures and supply chain (re)design opportunities. The general con-
sensus is that blockchain technology can mainly ensure transparency 
and traceability in food systems with further positive effects regarding 
food safety and consumers’ trust. 


2.2. Technology-enabled supply network design 


Blockchain is recognised as an ordered list of blocks which contain 
data and information regarding transactions, records, and events 
(Kamble, Gunasekaran, & Sharma, 2019). However, the structure of the 
gathered and transmitted data along with the need to (re)design pro-
spective blockchain-enabled supply networks are often being neglected 
in the extant literature. 


2.2.1. Data and supply chain design implications 
Sener, Barut, Oztekin, Avcilar, and Yildirim (2019) found that in-


formation usage, rather than information sharing, among supply chain 
stakeholders could result in significantly better performance in terms of 
inventory, transportation, warehousing, and communication related 
costs. In tandem with the tamper proof records of blockchain that help 
cultivate a culture of trust, the commercially viable nature of end-to- 
end supply networks could be ensured (Nidumolu, Ellison, Whalen, & 
Billman, 2014). Within a digitalised business environment, we adopt 
the suggestion of Kohtamäki, Parida, Oghazi, Gebauer, and Baines 
(2019) who recognised that data alignment among firms within specific

ecosystems can propel value capture by all involved stakeholders. To 
that end, supply chain processes need to be (re)designed to accom-
modate blockchain-related data requirements and specifications. 


2.2.2. Blockchain implementation elements 
Astill et al. (2019) identified key technological enablers required to 


advance transparency in food supply chains, namely: (i) data acquisi-
tion technologies; (ii) Internet of Things; (iii) data management plat-
forms; and (iv) Big Data analytics solutions. Furthermore, dos Santos, 
Torrisi, Yamada, and Pantoni (2019) described the implementation of 
smart contracts and blockchain tokens, based on the ISO 22005:2007 
standard, to certify the origin of food ingredients via a mobile phone 
application. Also, Borrero (2019) provided an overview of blockchain 
implementation in the supply chain of berries in southern Spain and 
highlighted basic technical requirements. 


Kumar, Liu, and Shan (2019) examined blockchain design and im-
plementation phases in a food supply chain context with the aim to 
provide a pragmatic view about the associated key challenges of sto-
rage, networking, and processing costs. Moreover, Kamble, 
Gunasekaran, and Sharma (2019) identified thirteen enablers of 
blockchain technology in agriculture supply chains and further in-
vestigated the underpinning causal relationships. Table 2 summarises 
blockchain implementation elements in supply networks and further 
depicts the particular lack of focus in the structure of the data needed to 
be collected across different echelons of operations. 


3. Materials and methods 


Considering that the outcome of this research shall contribute to 
SDGs through developing principles for blockchain-centric supply chain 
design, along with a technology implementation framework, the object 
of scrutiny has to be a critical analysis of the relevant literature 
(Tranfield, Denyer, & Smart, 2003), whilst further supported by real- 
world case studies (Gibbert, Ruigrok, & Wicki, 2008). Therefore, fol-
lowing the provided literature overview in the field, the theoretical lens 
and the research design underpinning this study are detailed in the sub- 
sections that follow. 


3.1. Theoretical lens 


The realisation of food traceability is not underpinned by any gen-
erally approved conceptual framework or theory (Karlsen, Dreyer, 
Olsen, & Elvevoll, 2013). To that end, motivated by the need to support 
real-world blockchain implementation in fish supply network opera-
tions, this study followed a pragmatist research philosophy to allow the 
collection of both objective and subjective data (Saunders, Lewis, & 
Thornhill, 2009). 


From a theoretical standpoint, the enabling role of blockchain 
technology in fulfilling supply chain management objectives (e.g., cost, 
quality, flexibility) is recognised (Ksherti, 2018). However, to 


systematically investigate blockchain in the supply chain management 
arena, we complementarily adopted the “Principal-Agent Theory” and 
the “Transaction Cost Analysis” Theory for blockchain-centric supply 
chain (re)design, along with the “Resource-Based View” and the 
“Network Theory” for blockchain-centric supply chain management 
(Halldórsson, Kotzab, Mikkola, & Skjøtt-Larsen, 2007). A combination 
of these theories has been applied to motivate middle-range theory 
development for interpreting structural and management changes in 
supply chains imposed by disruptive technologies (Treiblmaier, 2018). 


Following the theoretical framework of Halldórsson et al. (2007), 
and considering that data structure was not distinctly contemplated by  
Treiblmaier (2018), this research selected blockchain data as the pri-
mary focus of analysis. In particular:  


• “Principal-Agent Theory” – Information asymmetry between supply 
and demand echelons is a common issue in supply chain manage-
ment that can negatively impact stakeholders’ relationship (Whipple 
& Roh, 2010). Therefore it can be argued that consistent data 
structures enable blockchain technology implementation and are a 
requisite to align priorities and inter-firm contracting perspectives 
(Jensen & Meckling, 1976).  


• “Transaction Cost Analysis” Theory – Data visibility and reliability 
are key in governing production and transaction costs in a supply 
chain owing to the higher level of information sharing that helps 
assess performance of contractual agreements and reduce opportu-
nistic behaviour (Wacker, Yang, & Sheu, 2016). Therefore, based on 
the “Transaction Cost Analysis” Theory, asset specificity from the 
angle of data capture is a key attribute of supply chain transactions 
enabled by blockchain technology (Rindfleisch & Heide, 1997).  


• “Resource-Based View” Theory – Accurate data is recognised as a 
primary resource for supply chain operational performance and 
competitive advantage (Chae, Yang, Olson, & Sheu, 2014). How-
ever, data can be available in various types within a supply chain 
that serve data usability purposes only within specific analytical 
systems or software. In particular, understanding the stratification 
and identification of existing data types could help tackle triple 
bottom-line sustainability concerns (Raut et al., 2019), like food 
losses and waste generation (Irani et al., 2018). To that effect, fol-
lowing the “Resource-Based View” Theory, data interoperability 
even at the level of insignificant processes can assist in tackling the 
heterogeneity of supply chain data sources and capabilities, and to 
the configuration of operational competency (Halldórsson & Skjøtt- 
Larsen, 2004).  


• “Network Theory” – Except for transactions in supply chains, data is 
a driver of interorganisational relationships and can be used to es-
tablish interfaces among the different types of resources at the in-
volved operational echelons (Rinehart, Eckert, Handfield, Page, & 
Atkin, 2004). Consequently, according to the “Network Theory”, 
streamlining data archetypes among the various dispersed data sets 
is essential for assuring two types of stakeholder interactions 
(Johanson & Mattsson, 1987): (i) exchange processes (e.g., in-
formation, products); and (ii) adaptation processes (e.g., legal, ad-
ministrative elements). 


Therefore, this research investigated the unexplored linkages be-
tween the unit of analysis per considered complementary theory to 
understand supply chain (re)design and management opportunities 
enabled by blockchain technology (Fig. 1). Specifically, we argue that 
supply chain (re)design should include the elements of data consistency 
and data capture to eliminate any transaction errors that can impact 
operational and sustainability performance assessment, along with the 
pertinent decision-making process. Ensuring data unit consistency 
across end-to-end supply chain operations and utilising digital tech-
nologies to capture data can help eliminate human errors. Furthermore, 
to manage blockchain and the available multiple types of data in sus-
tainable supply networks, SDG-centric data interoperability and data

archetypes are required. Traditional data interoperability and data ar-
chetypes typically have a financial focus and may not capture sustain-
able development perspectives. 


3.2. Research design 


Considering that the aim of this research is to derive theoretical 
findings with practical implementation potential, a multiple case study 
research strategy was adopted (Yin, 2003). The case study approach 
allowed to combine a range of data and information gathering methods, 
like interviews and field observations, thus fostering the understanding 
of the real-world context of blockchain-enabled food supply chains 
(Eisenhardt, 1989). This research is inductive as it employed a bottom- 
up approach to collect data and information, map fish supply chain 
operations, and generate insights. 


3.2.1. Case identification 
Aquaculture constitutes an important source of national incomes, 


specifically for developing countries; hence, blockchain could catalyse 
seafood trade and logistics by establishing direct links between pro-
ducers and consumers (Bush, Belton, Little, & Islam, 2019). In-
dicatively, Thailand is a major global seafood trader with exports va-
lued at US$5.8 billion in 2017, contributing about 20% to the national 
food exports (USDA, 2018). However, the limited application of effi-
cient and reliable traceability systems across end-to-end fish supply 
chains often results in significant overexploitation of the marine fishery 
resources, product recalls, foodborne illnesses, and financial losses 
(Xiong et al., 2016). For example, overfishing phenomena exert sig-
nificant pressure on the marine fisheries’ stock in the Andaman Sea and 
the Gulf of Thailand. Notably, the European Commission asserted 
pressure on Thailand to proceed to timely improvements on the gov-
ernance of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities by is-
suing the country with a yellow card (European Commission, 2015). In 
this regard, implementing a reliable full-chain traceability system in the 
Thai fishery ecosystem could improve the export outlook of the sector. 


The main SDG challenges related to the Thai fish industry are in-
serted in Table 3. To develop a more robust construct about blockchain 
in the Thai fishery ecosystem, we conducted three case studies to collect 
essential data, namely: (i) Case study #1 – Local fishing operations; (ii) 
Case study #2 – Commercial fishing operations and trade; and (iii) Case 
study #3 – Canned tuna manufacturing. The different scale of opera-
tions that were investigated through these case studies allowed the 
identification of particularities along with the examination of block-
chain implementation challenges and potential in the Thai fishery 
ecosystem. This multi-scale perspective assisted in generating robust 
and valid results. 


3.2.2. Data collection 
The approached Thai fish supply chain stakeholders were initially 


involved in semi-structured interviews and field research; the interview 
participants represent the main stakeholders in the Thai fishery eco-
system hence allowing the collection of data and information from 
different perspectives and over a range of processes, technical aspects, 
social angles, and legal related issues. In particular, seven key cate-
gories of actors were recognised involving a total of fifteen informants, 
namely: (i) fishermen; (ii) traders; (iii) processors; (iv) wholesalers; (v) 
technology providers; (vi) certification organisations; and (vii) gov-
ernmental bodies. 


Especially, data and information were collected via three case stu-
dies involving: (i) thirteen semi-structured interviews with stakeholders 
in the Thai fish industry; (ii) three physical walkthroughs; and (iii) 
official documentation that is used during the operations. Table 4 en-
lists the interviews’ informants along with the selection criteria and the 
utilised data collection methodology. Table A1 in the Appendix sum-
marises the salient points of the interviews. The triangulation of data 
captured via direct field observations and documentation of operations 


helped in mitigating the bias from the semi-structured interviews and in 
ensuring validity and quality of the findings (Yin, 2009). 


3.2.3. Data analysis 
The data and information collected were analysed based on the 


principles adopted from the Best Practice Guidelines on Traceability 
(FAO, 2014), as summarised in Fig. 2. Initially, TraceFish (i.e. a series 
of voluntary standards relating to information recorded at every fish 
supply chain echelon) was used to evaluate the completeness of data 
collection by different supply chain stakeholders as being the accep-
table standard in the industry (Konovalenko & Ludwig, 2019). The data 
collected from the case studies was compared to the list of Key Data 
Elements recommended by TraceFish to determine the completeness of 
stakeholders’ data sets. Secondly, the “Unique Identification” (i.e. any 
unit or actor that modifies the product should be recognisable) was 
assessed by using a process mapping framework for seafood firms’ 
traceability systems developed by Mai, Margeirsson, Stefansson, and 
Arason (2010). Thirdly, data sharing was evaluated by analysing the 
communication method between various stakeholders and vertical in-
tegration. Finally, the capabilities of the technology were analysed 
against a set of criteria gathered from literature and the case studies. 


4. Fish supply network ecosystem in Thailand 


The fishery ecosystem in Thailand consists of thirteen distinct ac-
tors, as these are mapped on three clusters (Fig. 3), namely: (i) national 
bodies; (ii) key stakeholders; and (iii) certification bodies. Notably, 
every national entity utilises its proprietary database despite any 
overlaps of the gathered data. Therefore, an increased probability of 
maintaining duplicate and/or incomplete databases exists. 


From a legislative perspective, fishing is only allowed to registered 
vessels. Officially, two types of vessels are recognised in Thailand 
(Table 5): (i) local fishing vessels; and (ii) commercial vessels. Local 
fishing vessels are neither required to install a Global Positioning 
System tracker nor to have a logbook. On the other end, commercial 
vessels are required to both have an installed Global Positioning System 
tracker, called Vessel Monitoring System, to inform about the real-time 
location of the vessel and to record all required information onto an 
issued logbook. Currently, a total of 27,261 registered local vessels and 
10,615 registered commercial vessels operate in Thailand. 


4.1. Case study #1 – local fishing operations 


In order to map local fishing operations, the activities of “Fishermen 
1”, who own a 9 Gt vessel in Prachuap Kiri Khan, were observed. The 
laws applicable to local fishermen are loose and this reflects upon the 
management style of “Fishermen 1”. 


4.1.1. Fishing processes 
At the predeparture stage, “Fishermen 1” load ice and insulation 


storage boxes on the vessels while the fishing equipment (e.g., sonar) is 
prepared the previous day (see Image S1 in the Supplementary 
Material). Regarding the fishing method, “Fishermen 1” use the ‘purse 
seining’ approach which allows the capturing of targeted fish species 
with a low probability of unintentional by-catches. The captured fish 
are sorted by size and stored inside boxes/buckets of ice (see Image S2 
in the Supplementary Material). After the fishing is completed, “Fish-
ermen 1” return to the port to unload the catch and trade with fish-
mongers. 


“Fishermen 1” return to the departed port, without having to 
comply to a particular schedule or inform any authority, and then un-
load and weight the fish catch. The empirical study revealed that ap-
proximately 3% of the catch would be characterised by minor damages 
such as bruises; however, these fish are not discarded as such defects 
are considered insignificant. Thereafter, fishmongers would sell the fish 
to the local market. The market usually consists of local restaurants and

Blockchain in the Thai fish industry and relevant United Nations Sustainable Development Goals challenges.     


Sustainable Development Goal 
(SDG) 


Description Selected Supporting Study(ies)   


▪ SDG #1 – No Poverty Due to the low compensation generated from traditional monocrop 
plantations, viability in the fish industry can enhance household 
income. In addition, the Asian crisis during the 1990s followed by the 
recent global economic crisis affected Thailand in terms of food price 
shocks and inflationary pressures. Thus, fish exports could support the 
local and national economy. However, blockchain technology could 
ensure exports’ potential and help transform the traditional fishery 
ecosystem to high-value business chains via building trust in the 
international markets. 


Klasen, Lechtenfeld, and Povel (2015), Tanielian (2018), 
Viswanathan (2008)  


▪ SDG #3 – Good Health and 
Wellbeing 


Blockchain in the fish industry could eliminate illegal, unreported, 
and unregulated fishing in Thai waters and limit the provision of 
products with uncertain quality, hence allowing the national fishery 
ecosystem to sustain its contribution to food security. 


Nong (2019)  


▪ SDG #5 – Gender Equality In Thai rural provinces, about 21% of households are female-headed. 
Also, female-headed households in Thailand lose significant more 
assets due to food price shocks compared to male-headed households. 
Blockchain implementations can help record labour statistics and 
motivate gender equality in the industry. 


Klasen et al. (2015)  


▪ SDG #8 – Decent Work and 
Economic Growth 


In Thailand, illegal labour practices in the fish industry are prevalent. 
Thai fishing fleets are mainly staffed by poor migrant workers (mainly 
from Myanmar, Laos, and Cambodia) who often encounter rights 
abuses and receive very small salaries. Blockchain implementations 
can help assure visibility over labour working conditions and 
motivate fair trade agreements. 


Lindley and Techera (2017)  


▪ SDG #12 – Responsible 
Consumption and Production 


The Thai fish industry is characterised by major sustainability 
challenges related to responsible production, including: (i) illegal, 
unreported and unregulated fishing activities resulting to 11–26 
million tons of illegal caught fish per annum; and (ii) forced labour 
along with human and labour rights abuses. Blockchain ensures 
transparency, traceability and visibility over the sustainable 
performance across the supply chain. 


Poseidon (2019), Sasipornkarn (2019), Wipatayotin (2019)  


▪ SDG #14 – Life Below Water Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities in Thailand have 
resulted in declining fish species populations like seahorses and tuna. 
Blockchain could help monitor overexploitation fishing activities and 
inform targeted policies for the conservation of the marine ecosystem.

consumers. The process flow diagram of “Fishermen 1”, resulting from 
observations and interview insights, is illustrated in Fig. 4. 


4.1.2. Data captured 
Considering the legislative requirements for vessels with size less 


than 10 Gt, “Fishermen 1” are not obliged to gather any data related to 
fishing operations and to the fish catch per se. The only recorded in-
formation refers to the invoices of fishmongers which state the weight, 
species, and price of the traded fish. 


4.2. Case study #2 – commercial fishing operations and trade 


Commercial fishing operations are performed by “Fishermen 2” who 
are located in Phuket. The entire process is more complicated compared 
to local fishing operations owing to the dominant interdependency 
among storage duration, fish freshness, and profit, which could affect 
the scheduling of the operations and the quality of the traded seafood. 


4.2.1. Fishing processes 
“Fishermen 2” empirically prepare sufficient volumes of ice for 


storing and preserving the catch during fishing to achieve maximum 
profit under the constraints of seafood freshness and the vessel’s fuel. 
Fishing vessels cannot be sailing for more than thirty consecutive days; 
nevertheless, “Fishermen 2” return to port within about fifteen days of 
departure to maintain the freshness of the caught fish. Every vessel is 
equipped with a Vessel Monitoring System that tracks and monitors the 
fishing operations while the data are centrally stored and managed by 
the Department of Fisheries to inspect for any illegal, unreported and 
unregulated activities. “Fishermen 2” use the ‘fishing trawler’ method 
which is considered unsustainable as it associates to high killing rates of 
by-catches. In this regard, any endangered fish species caught are 


required to be recorded on the vessel’s logbook (see Image S3 in the 
Supplementary Material). The trawling process is performed three to 
four times during a day. Thereafter, the catch is released onto the vessel 
and the sorting process begins while the trapping is repeated (see Image 
S4 in the Supplementary Material).

N. Tsolakis, et al.   






In Thailand there are thirty ports that can accept commercial vessels 
for unloading seafood to prevent unreported catch. In this regard, 
fishermen are required to book a date and request a specific time- 
window from the destination port to land vessels and unload the catch. 
In addition, a ‘Port-In-Port-Out’ form must be administered to the 
Department of Fisheries while a photographic copy of the logbook data 
recorded during the trip must be submitted via a public messaging 
application to obtain approval prior to unloading the catch at a speci-
fied port (see Image S5 in the Supplementary Material). “Fishermen 2” 
then unload and deliver the catch to the trader. Notably, the fish sto-
rage containers include a varying amount of ice due to lack of storage 
conditions’ monitoring or differences in the dates of the catch (see  
Image S6 in the Supplementary Material). The process flow diagram of 
“Fishermen 2” is depicted in Fig. 5. 


4.2.2. Trading processes 
Traders are responsible for supplying the consumers’ market with 


seafood delivered by the fishermen, with the risk of unsold units. A 
trader proceeds to a more accurate seafood sorting process performed 
on an aluminium platform (see Image S7 in the Supplementary 
Material). The seafood is segregated into different containers according 
to species, size, freshness, and appearance; the fish are not preserved in 
ice until the end of the auction. Each sorting container is labelled by the 
fishermen with a paper-based printed vessel code (see Image S8 in the 
Supplementary Material) to account for traceability (see Image S9 in 
the Supplementary Material). Following the seafood weighting and 
provision to the market (see Image S10 and Image S11 in the 
Supplementary Material), the gathered data (already recorded onto the 
vessels’ logbook) is reported to the ‘Port-In-Port-Out’ form by the tra-
ders to prevent overfishing and illegal trade. The process flow diagram 
of the “Trader” is shown in Fig. 6. 


4.2.3. Data captured 
Every stakeholder involved in commercial fishing activities needs to 


record data. “Fishermen 2” are required to record all their data onto the 
fishing logbook while, prior to unloading the catch, a ‘Port-In-Port-Out’ 
form must be completed. Traders need to record less data compared to 
fishermen. Data required for international customers, where interna-
tional standards apply, would be different. The detailed list of Key Data 
Elements recorded in commercial fishing operations is inserted in Table 
A2 in the Appendix.

specifications. In 2017, the manufacturer received 45 million kg of 
tuna, 80% of which was imported. 


4.3.1. Canned tuna processes 
In terms of inbound logistics, tuna is delivered in containers which 


would then be loaded onto a conveyor so that fish are manually sorted 
by weight. To conduct quality control tests, a random sample is taken 
from the batch. Following the inspection and sorting process, the batch 
is registered to the inventory system and transferred to the cold storage 
warehouse with a maximum storage duration of three months. 


Regarding the manufacturing process, tuna would be taken out for 
the thawing process and would be traced with the use of a production 
card as a tool for tracing material flows (see Image S12 in the 
Supplementary Material). After the cleaning, tunas are placed on trol-
leys where relevant information would be recorded on the production 
card. Herein, all data are recorded by RFID tags (see Image S13 in the 
Supplementary Material) which accompany the tuna until the end of 
the filleting process. The fillets are then automatically canned. The 
ingredients and packaging identification number would be linked to the 
product identification number for traceability purposes. 


Production output is affected by three main factors, namely: (i) tuna 
size; (ii) tuna species; and (iii) skills of operators. The process flow

4.3.2. Data captured 
Data required to be captured by the canned tuna manufacturer de-


pends on the specifications of the customers. After the tunas are being 
weighted and sorted, the traceability information provided by the 
supplier for the production batch would be linked to each batch’s 
identification number. A final sealing report for each batch would be 
created and approved by the quality control department. The compre-
hensive list of Key Data Elements for the canned tuna manufacturing 
supply chain is provided in Table A3 in the Appendix. 


5. Discussion 


Evidence derived from the literature and empirical observations 
reveal that notwithstanding the proliferation of industrial discussions 
and academic studies on blockchain, limited understanding is

demonstrated over the data structure requirements for supporting the 
technology implementation and the respective supply chain (re)design. 
The results of the case studies suggest that data consistency, capture, 
interoperability and archetypes-related issues exist in the Thai fish 


s-
u-


pply chain that could ultimately impact the resilience of the fishery 
system and the achievement of SDGs. To that end, this research ar-
ticulates four principles for blockchain implementation, namely:  


• Principle #1 “Data Archetypes” – Linking data sets available in 


Fig. 6. Seafood trading process flow diagram.  


Fig. 7. Canned tuna manufacturing process flow diagram.  


N. Tsolakis, et al.   






multiple echelons of supply chains is essential.  
• Principle #2 “Data Capture” – Data on technology limitations needs 


to be captured.  
• Principle #3 “Data Consistency” – Data archetypes should not only 


be developed for compliance purposes, but they have to extend 
beyond regulatory requirements.  


• Principle #4 “Data Interoperability” – Insignificant supply chain 
processes and operations have to be accounted. 


5.1. Data archetypes (Principle #1) 


The observations of fishermen, traders and the manufacturer’s ac-
tivities emphasise the lack of interface between operations and in-
formation flow, in terms of workflows and data triggers, meaning that 
the granularity of data is lost at the transition points from upstream to 
downstream supply chain operations thus limiting transparency and 
traceability. Key observations with regard to the limited possibility of 
linking data across fish supply chains include:  


• Legislative voids – Fish supply network stakeholders might leverage 
legislation to avoid recording data that could reassure traceability 
and food safety. For example, local fishermen are not obliged to 
record any data. However, considering the local fishing capacity 
(~72% of total vessels) and the short cycle-times of the respective 
operations, fishmongers have access to fish supplies that are only 
accounted for their weight and species. The absence of any records 
also allows the possibility for overfishing and by-catches of en-
dangered species. In addition, commercial fishermen and traders are 
not required to record any data with regard to fish unloading, 
sorting, and storage conditions.  


• Not standardised data structure and recording format – The lack of 
standardisation in data structures and means of data recording es-
tablishes decoupling points across supply chain transactions. Firstly, 
local fishermen do not need to record any data and fishmongers 
have visibility only about the species and the weight of the traded 
fish supplies. Secondly, commercial vessels use a manually updated 
logbook to record data with regard to the fishing activities while the 
Vessel Monitoring System is only used for verifying the location of 
vessels and not to record or transmit fish catch reports. Furthermore, 
the arrival ports require only a pictorial copy of the logbook, a 
format that does not allow the automatic extraction and analysis of 
the data gathered during fishing activities. Thereafter, traders sort 
the fish into containers and the only traceability element refers to a 
hand-written note with each vessel’s code. Thirdly, the canned tuna 
manufacturer receives fish containers without having access to data 
about the geographical origin of the fish. Quality inspections on the 
production line are based on random samplings without providing 
the capability to track the vessel of origin or even the trapping 
process. 


Therefore, linking the data sets that are available across the dif-
ferent supply chain echelons of operations is essential to ensure sus-
tainable performance. Adopting common data archetypes can assist 
towards this direction. 


5.2. Data capture (Principle #2) 


Data capture mechanisms and technologies have inherent technical 
limitations and functional challenges that raise data reliability con-
cerns. On the one end, paper-based data recording on logbooks entails 
bias, lacks accuracy, enables duplicated data recordings, and renders 
the data not reliable or even not accessible in case the physical logbook 
is damaged. On the other end, functional disruption of the data re-
cording mechanisms could result in data inconsistencies or gaps. 
Indicatively, during commercial fishing operations the intentional or 
unintentional malfunction of the Vessel Monitoring System could result 


in the manipulation of the fishing location data thus raising visibility 
concerns over illegal fishing operations. 


Another technical aspect refers to the calibration of any used 
equipment. For example, the mere common metric used to assess the 
traded seafood is the fish weight; however, the weighting process is 
typically executed by using a probably decalibrated or malfunctioning 
equipment. In addition, quality controls, if any applied in practice, are 
based on visual inspection that entails the subjective judgement of the 
involved operators. Therefore, capturing data with regard to technology 
limitations is essential to allow for data accountability and trust. 


5.3. Data consistency (Principle #3) 


Empirical evidence led to the conclusion that data regarding the 
flow of food products throughout the observed fish supply network is 
only recorded for merely regulatory compliance purposes. However, the 
magnitude of the gathered data is not leveraged to essentially support 
fish traceability or to inform downstream operations. 


In a future state, to realise the potential of advanced traceability 
systems, data collection accountability would require stakeholders to 
demonstrate relevant responsibility. For example, local fishermen ac-
count for about 70% of the total fishing vessels and are not required to 
install a Vessel Monitoring System. Therefore, adulteration, commercial 
frauds, and dangerous substitutions are possible, whereas in case of 
quality and safety incidents food recalls of particular fish batches will 
not be feasible. Moreover, the reporting of by-catches of endangered 
species is manual, thus the monitoring of any environmentally or 
wildlife biodiversity damaging actions is not ascertained. To that end, 
data consistency is needed as data archetypes should not only be de-
veloped for compliance purposes, but they have to extend beyond 
regulatory requirements. 


5.4. Data interoperability (Principle #4) 


The scope of traceability needs to guide the design of data collection 
and sharing. For the case of the Thai fish industry, the primary aim of 
data recording is to avoid illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing 
operations. However, this is contradictory to the fact that around 70% 
of the fishing vessels are not required to be equipped with an electronic 
positioning system. In addition, certain critical operations are over-
looked in terms of data monitoring, including:  


• Ice preparation – The volume and condition of the ice prepared prior 
to fishing activities is not monitored. The temperature of the ice is 
not recorded while the ice might not ensure the appropriate pre-
servation conditions for the stored fish after the catch. Similar rea-
soning applies for the ice used to store fish in containers for trading.  


• Fish unloading – The unloading of the fish occurs on the vessel’s 
deck or on aluminium platforms at the port. The cleaning process of 
these surfaces, if any exists, is not documented.  


• Fish sorting – The sorting of fish, occurring either on a vessel’s deck 
or at the port, is prone to subjectivity errors particularly in terms of 
species and skin quality. 


In this regard, data interoperability is important as multiple insig-
nificant supply chain operations are often being overlooked; however, 
the aggregate effect of such neglected processes could severely impact 
the sustainability of fish supply network operations. 


5.5. Blockchain-centric supply networks design and implementation 
framework 


Main concerns relating to fish supply chain operations include: (i) 
lack of connectivity between different departmental databases; (ii) no 
logbook requirement for local fishing vessels; (iii) lack of requirement 
for Vessel Monitoring System installation on local fishing vessels; (iv) 


N. Tsolakis, et al.   






inability to share logbook information in real-time; (v) 20% tolerance 
allowance on the accuracy of the amount of fish catch; and (vi) un-
registered vessels. To that end, blockchain could be a feasible tech-
nology intervention for the viability and sustainability of the fishery 
ecosystem in Thailand but requires a set of supply chain design and 
technology implementation decisions. 


5.5.1. Research findings 
Lack of databases’ integrity in the Thai government system in-


stigates data inaccuracy issues in the fish industry, like incorrect 
number of registered vessels, thus overlooking illegal activities and 
impeding traceability. As local fishing vessels are triple in number 
compared to commercial vessels, about 11–26 million tons of fish 
caught annually are not recorded and are not considered in the sus-
tainability assessment of the national aquaculture ecosystem. In addi-
tion, due to the technical inability for real-time sharing of the vessels’ 
logbook information, a tolerance level of 20% is allowed on the accu-
racy of the amount of the fish catch. Considering the nature of the 
challenges in the Thai fish industry, Table 6 summarises relevant 
blockchain-centric supply chain design recommendations. 


5.5.2. Blockchain implementation framework 
Blockchain applications in the food sector provide added value in 


areas like trust, security, and decentralisation (Galvez, Mejuto, & Simal- 
Gandara, 2018). However, extant studies focus on the business benefits 
or information technology elements of traceability systems without 
discussing the data structures and their importance to supply chain 
management. Our claim is that the design of blockchain-centric supply 
chains should first consider the existing data structures and technology 
specifications in place. To that effect, the adoption process of an ef-
fective blockchain platform includes decisions at both supply chain 
design and technology implementation levels, as depicted in the pro-
posed framework in Fig. 8. 


5.5.2.1. Design decisions. Transitioning towards value networks 
enabled by blockchain technology requires that fundamental 
traceability systems are implemented to achieve tangible (e.g., market 
growth) and intangible (e.g., corporate reputation) benefits (Mai, 
Bogason, Arason, Árnason, & Matthíasson, 2010). In this regard, an 
effective production identification system has to already link resources 
to other Key Data Elements and to the finished product. Following that, 
on the condition that Key Data Elements are complete, the data 
gathering method is important for ensuring data accuracy. A 
blockchain database is a trusted database in an untrusted 
environment. In this sense, blockchain could be complemented by 
Internet of Things technologies to increase productivity and food 
traceability (Tian, 2017). Automation (e.g., RFID e-tagging and 
scanning of fish) ensures data accuracy as it eliminates human errors 
and intentional fraud that typically result in incorrect information 
(Girard & Du Payrat, 2017). The use of sensors and automation allows 
the integration of total quality management in the blockchain. Basic 
digital technologies that need to underpin blockchain include: 


• RFID tags to trace fish from origin and collect data transmitted di-
rectly from sensors (e.g., date, time, temperature).  


• Smart weighting system that takes into consideration a vessel’s 
movement while weighting the fish catch during fishing operations. 
Weight logging could be automated to help forecast the landing date 
to the selected port.  


• On-board survey cameras and electronic monitoring systems to help 
identify interactions with by-catches and protected fish species. 


The benefits of blockchain in end-to-end supply networks can be 
operationalised through the establishment of a trustworthy traceability 
system that enables sharing of critical data among all collaborating 
actors. For instance, upstream suppliers would benefit from improved 


relationships with corporate customers to generate more business op-
portunities while downstream customers gain access to trusted data 
that prevent fraud and ensure food safety. Collaboration is re-
commended both among companies to improve the audit process and 
between governmental authorities of neighbouring countries to im-
prove accuracy in aquaculture monitoring and fishing operations. 


Furthermore, a major design decision is to select the on-chain or off- 
chain attributes to be shared on a blockchain. Companies need to bal-
ance among performance, privacy, and risk as the blockchain will be 
growing continuously due to data agglomerations. 


5.5.2.2. Implementation decisions. Integrated off-the-self blockchain 
solutions for supply chains are being developed and tested. However, 
depending on the blockchain implementation purpose, type of data, and 
participants in the blockchain, enterprises can select the type of 
permission, consensus, smart contracts, and storage location, 
accordingly. In particular, for enterprises some data would be 
confidential, therefore a permissioned or hybrid blockchain would be 
more suitable to maintain firm proprietary competitive edge. 


6. Conclusions 


This research extends the “Principal Agent Theory” and the 
“Transaction Cost Analysis” Theory into the digital supply chain design 
domain, while contemporarily broadening the “Resource-Based View” 
Theory and the “Network Theory” view into the digital supply chain 
management field, specifically within the context of SDGs. In response 
to the research question considered in this study, blockchain-centric 
food supply chain designs that foster SDGs need to ensure data con-
sistency for extending the focus on regulatory compliance purposes 
towards sustainability impact. To this end, the pivotal role of data 
capture is recognised to alleviate any data consistency challenges. In 
addition, blockchain-centric food supply chain management for SDGs 
needs to consider data interoperability among the dispersed systems 
and services to enable the efficient sharing of the content and context of 
the captured data. To that effect, the management of data archetypes is 
essential to link the different data sets that are available across multiple 
supply chain echelons. 


From a technical viewpoint, key primary and secondary research 
evidence suggests that data asymmetry exists in the Thai fish supply 
chain that hinders the achievement of SDGs. Especially, the require-
ments of a blockchain implementation should derive from: (i) the ex-
pected scope of the technology application; (ii) the nature and speci-
ficities of the targeted operations; (iii) the type of data to be gathered 
and shared; and (iv) the participants in the blockchain. Thereafter, 
organisations can consider the type of permission, consensus, smart 
contracts, and storage locations, accordingly. Furthermore, the study 
findings confirm that the application opportunities of blockchain in fish 
supply networks clearly indicate that a single technological solution to 
tackle supply chain transparency and traceability challenges is not 
feasible. The design of a respective supply network depends on the 
fundamentals of traceability systems, namely Key Data Elements and 
collection mechanisms thereof. These elements need to be designed and 
managed properly for enabling the benefits of blockchain. From an 
implementation perspective, in human-dependent data entry points, 
errors or even fraud incidents could occur; hence, Internet of Things 
applications can help address data inaccuracy issues. Except for the 
non-exclusive traceability, immutability and trust related benefits, 
blockchain enables sustainability performance and helps promote 
SDGs.

Blockchain-centric supply chain design recommendations for the fish industry.      


Case Observations and Issues Consequences Blockchain-centric Supply Chain Design 
Recommendations   


▪ Governmental 
Challenge  


• Different databases for different fisheries-related 
departments.  


• Different data in different databases.  • Create a decentralised database using 
blockchain to gain access to data in near real- 
time.  


▪ Governmental 
Challenge  


• 20% tolerance on weight of catch allowed to 
fishermen.  


• Over-fishing.  • Data inaccuracy.  • Implement an on-board smart weighting system to increase weighting accuracy 
during fishing; automatically record the 
weight and transmit this information to the 
blockchain.  


▪ Governmental 
Challenge  


• Unregistered vessels are untraceable.  • Illegal, unreported and unregulated 
fishing.  


• Detect unregistered/illegal vessels with 
coastal radars and satellites.  


▪ Case Study #1 & 
Case Study #2  


• Paper-based logbook delays data transmission into 
the government’s traceability system.  


• Fraud opportunities.  • Low efficiency.  • Implement Electronic Catch Documentation Traceability or Electronic Recording and 
Reporting System or E-logbook where catch 
data can be immediately recorded and 
become accessible to the government in near 
real-time. Information on the location from 
the Vessel Monitoring System can also be 
automatically linked to the catch data. These 
data can be immutably stored on a 
blockchain.  


▪ Case Study #2  • With the current Vessel Monitoring System 
fishermen can decide to switch it off at any point in 
time but would risk getting caught and fined.  


• Illegal, unreported and unregulated 
fishing.  


• Install a motion sensor at ports to monitor 
incompliance of vessel entry at ‘Port-In’ case 
of illegal unloading of catch.  • Use alternative technological solutions, such as 
the Pelagic Data System which is a solar- 
powered Global Positioning System that can 
operate 24 h per day.  


▪ Case Study #2  • Unmonitored storage temperature of fish on 
vessels.  • Inconsistency in the amount of ice mixed with 
seafood in each basket.  


• Inappropriate storage temperature 
has a high probability in impacting 
seafood freshness, thus resulting in 
food safety issues.  


• Install a temperature sensor to continuously 
monitor storage temperature. An approval 
process can be self-executed by creating a 
protocol to verify the seafood storage 
temperature with a smart contract. This can 
improve the safety and quality of the seafood 
and can accelerate the verification process 
using a trusted mechanism.  


▪ Case Study #2  • Lack of batch identification number and tracking 
mechanism.  


• Lack of traceability.  • Implement Radio-Frequency Identification to 
trace the product. Radio-Frequency 
Identification can be linked to different 
sensors and data can be automatically stored 
to a blockchain.  


▪ Case Study #2  • Inaccuracy in identifying the weight of catch as it 
is technically difficult to measure weight on a 
moving vessel.  


• Inaccurate data collection.  • Implement smart weighting system at sea to 
increase accuracy of measurement while 
data can be automatically transmitted on a 
blockchain.  


▪ Case Study #2  • Limitation in monitoring off-shore activities such 
as actual fishing equipment used and illegal by- 
catches caught.  


• Illegal, unreported and unregulated 
fishing.  


• Use digital documentation, through for 
example photos or videos, as proof of 
equipment used and desired information 
recorded and time-stamped off-chain 
(because the file sizes are big).  


▪ Case Study #3  • Duplication can occur with Catch Certificates in 
terms that a single ‘Catch_Certificate.pdf’ file is 
sent to multiple buyers. Currently, there is no 
platform for cross-checking Catch Certificates.  


• Product delivered may be mixed or 
replaced by illegal, unreported and 
unregulated fish but stated in the 
documents as ‘certified’.  • Sales exceed the amount of certified 
provisioned fish.  


• Transmit the available information in a 
public blockchain, as being a responsibility 
of the government. A consensus can be 
created to validate the transactions in case a 
particular Catch Certificate reference 
number has not already been taken by 
someone else, i.e. a different buyer. 
Blockchain can make this possible to prevent 
sending duplicate certificates to multiple 
buyers.  


▪ Case Study #3  • Data interoperability is limited with the use of 
paper-based systems.  


• Interoperability issues.  • Implement, depending on the business 
model, a hybrid/permissioned blockchain as 
the most desirable type for fishery industries 
where a selection of data would be shared to 
the public (such as origin of catch, storage 
temperature, etc.) and confidential 
information would be shared with 
permissioned stakeholders across the value 
chain.

findings extend the “Resource-Based View” Theory and the “Network 
Theory” view into the digital supply chain management field. 


In the financial market, cautions about the prevalence of blockchain 
technology relate to the lack of governance as capital market regulators 
continue to raise disclosure requirements (Tappsocott & Tapscott, 
2017). However, in the case of food supply networks, operational and 
governance requirements are not significant thus fuelling the rapid and 
disruptive role of the technology, particularly in case blockchain is 
standardised and matures to accommodate considerable transaction 
volumes (Knezevic, 2018). 


Notably, uncertainties around data structure and blockchain im-
plementation result in only generic understanding over the issue and 
create confusion. On the contrary, this study contributes to the 
Operations Management field by applying a multiple case study ap-
proach, combining both primary and secondary data and information, 


to develop an integrated and pragmatic view over data structure and 
transparency in end-to-end fish supply networks enabled by blockchain 
technology. 


In addition, the findings of this research recognise the potential of 
blockchain to promote sustainability across a range of SDGs, depending 
on the particular operational context. In principal, blockchain promotes 
collaboration among stakeholders, hence allowing resources to be di-
rected to priority areas. For the case of fish supply networks, blockchain 
could help remove from the food market environmentally damaging, 
illegal or unethical products of uncertain geographical origin and 
quality, whilst enhancing consumers’ trust. Contemporarily, the in-
creased transparency and accountability could stimulate business 
growth in local fish industries, subsequently contributing to the well-
being of vulnerable populations. More specifically, this research ar-
ticulates four principles for blockchain-centric supply chain design, 


Table 6 (continued)     


Case Observations and Issues Consequences Blockchain-centric Supply Chain Design 
Recommendations   


▪ Wholesaler  • Audits and certification are usually only conducted 
once per year.  • Lack of full-chain real-time transparency and 
auditability.  


• Does not provide full prevention from 
fraud on days where suppliers were 
not audited but products can still be 
sold as ‘certified’.  


• Implement blockchain and Internet of Things 
to potentially solve this issue. Data can be 
collected in real-time onto a blockchain with 
the use of Internet of Things technologies. 
Certification organisations and customers 
can then audit the data at any point.  


▪ All Stakeholders  • Problems with not having access to real-time data.  • Less efficiency and safety of data.  • Use blockchain so that every organisation in 
the value chain would be able to access the 
same copy of data simultaneously.

along with a technology implementation framework, that could ulti-
mately impact the resilience of the fishery system and the achievement 
of SDGs, namely:  


• Principle #1 “Data Archetypes” – Linking data sets available in 
multiple echelons of supply chains is essential.  


• Principle #2 “Data Capture” – Data on technology limitations needs 
to be captured.  


• Principle #3 “Data Consistency” – Data archetypes should not only 
be developed for compliance purposes, but they have to extend 
beyond regulatory requirements.  


• Principle #4 “Data Interoperability” – Insignificant supply chain 
processes and operations have to be accounted. 


In line with the research concerns identified by Kouhizadeh and 
Sarkis (2018), this research contributes to the blockchain body of re-
search by investigating the real-world potential of blockchain im-
plementation to support the competitiveness and export dynamics of 
the Thai fish industry. At a greater extent, blockchain could enable the 
holistic consideration of a supply chain to integrate all involved sta-
keholders, data and technologies thereof, in a collaborative style and 
promote environmental sustainability in a consistent manner (Koh 
et al., 2013). 


6.2. Management implications 


The extant literature on blockchain technology is proliferated by 
conceptual expositions while real-word empirical cases in the non-fi-
nance sector are scarce (Ying, Jia, & Du, 2018). On the contrary, the 
findings of this research assist in addressing real-world practical issues 
by investigating fish supply chains in Thailand. The outcome of this 
research contributes to the management field by developing four 
principles for blockchain-centric supply chain design (i.e., “Data Ar-
chetypes” – “Data Capture” – “Data Consistency” –“Data Interoper-
ability”), along with proposing a blockchain implementation frame-
work structured around these principles. The proposed framework 
could assist the decision-making process of managers towards the 
achievement of SDGs. 


Blockchain in the fish industry can enable the development of the 
necessary real-time supply network capabilities (e.g., visibility and 
data-enabled product quality reporting) to catapult network perfor-
mance and competitiveness (de Oliveira & Handfield, 2019). Our study 
reveals that the use of more sensors and automation inspires total 


quality management to include devices’ certification and calibration 
into the blockchain. Moreover, contrary to established blockchain ap-
plications for cryptocurrency purposes, food supply networks entail 
physical commodities/products. Therefore, cryptographical proofs of 
the provenance and handling condition of fish could possibly disrupt 
the food certification industry as the cost of audits and certifications can 
be reduced. 


6.3. Limitations 


Few limitations that characterise this study occur that could moti-
vate further research. Firstly, during the fieldwork few fishermen 
seemed to be reluctant in providing direct answers about the fishing 
methods and records. As the Thailand’s Fishery Foundation informed, 
such an attitude could be attributed to the abrupt changes in the leg-
islation that did not allow enough time for the fishermen to adapt. 
Secondly, our research focused on the diversified data structures and 
recording practises while the provided blockchain-centric supply chain 
design and technology implementation framework does not capture 
technical details. 


6.4. Future research 


In the future, we aim to perform a similar detailed study on the 
agricultural sector to support the dual objective of efficiency and sus-
tainability, particularly with refer to natural and business resources’ 
appropriation in sensitive regions (Leng, Bi, Jing, Fu, & Van 
Nieuwenhuyse, 2018). Regarding data privacy concerns, further re-
search should also explore ownership and analytics functions that bal-
ance privacy preservation to information loss (Wieringa et al., 2019). 


Finally, we aspire to conduct pertinent studies on multiple food 
products and industrial sectors such as automotive, aerospace, and 
pharmaceuticals. Additionally, the proposed blockchain implementa-
tion framework requires multiple testing through action research in 
order to observe key patterns on how principles on blockchain-centric 
supply chain design and management vary in different sectors and how 
does product-process-location characteristics impact data consistency, 
data capture, data interoperability, and data archetypes.

Interviews’ salient points.    


Informant Key Points of Interview  


Wholesaler  • The Wholesaler, as a private-labelled supplier, is prone to the fish and seafood sourcing standards dictated by the customers.  • All the Wholesaler’s suppliers are certified by the British Retail Consortium, and therefore the Wholesaler has Good Manufacturing Practise, 
Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point, and Threat Assessment Critical Control Point systems in place. In addition, the Wholesaler has a Marine 
Stewardship Council Chain of Custody certification and uses a corresponding ecolabel on the packaging.  • The Wholesaler conducts on-site due diligence audits and routine traceability checks which cover a range of quality areas depending on the 
specific customers.  • The Wholesaler’s suppliers are required to have sufficient information to complete a full supply chain map back to source, a full vessel list, and 
ethical and sustainability risk assessment.  • Prior to signing a contract for supply, the Wholesaler seeks independent verification (by a consultant) that systems, documentation and evidence 
is in place for: (i) legal conformity; (ii) adherence to the Wholesaler’s policies (e.g., tuna sourcing protocol); and (iii) compliance to any specific 
customer requirements. The effectiveness of the system and processes is then checked at regular intervals by audits conducted by the Wholesaler.  • Wholesaler’s internal traceability is achieved through a commercial Enterprise Resource Planning system. Several of the Wholesaler’s suppliers 
who also use the same system would be able to share ‘few’ documents using Electronic Data Interchange. According to the Wholesaler, the 


(continued on next page)

Informant Key Points of Interview  


Electronic Data Interchange has limitations and can only allow the sharing of few documents. Therefore, communication and data sharing with 
suppliers and customers is mainly performed via e-mails and telephone calls.  • Shared database would reduce administrative burden and time spent on individual requests on sustainability information.  • Intentional or unintentional substitution of fish species can occur in the supply chain. An incentive for fraud or intentional substitution is cost 
reduction. When two species of fish look very similar, it is easy to mix them up. When the fishes are processed, it is even harder to differentiate 
them. For instance, Yellow Fin and Big Eye Tuna look and taste very similar; however, there is a difference in price. In case intentional 
substitution does occur, it is possible that the supplier could have also modified the paperwork to hide this fraudulent information.  • The Wholesaler does not raise any concerns regarding fraud, mislabelling or substitution with suppliers.  • The Wholesaler encounters minor losses sometimes where pallets or containers are accidentally damaged or poorly packed. The Wholesaler 
monitors these incidents to prevent them; however, major challenges include:  


1. Fish unavailability leading to shifting sources and processing sites at a challenging pace.  
2. Visibility that inevitably ‘blinds’ the Wholesaler regarding the current end-to-end supply chain operations.  • To gain visibility downstream the supply chain, the Wholesaler must engage with direct suppliers (Tier 1) who may be able to provide the 


information or can communicate with their suppliers (Tier 2) to gather this information. 
Marine Stewardship Council  • In the auditing process, the auditors would verify the absence of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities according to the fisheries 


and chain of custody standards. For fisheries, the assessment reports need to clearly state that there is no illegal fishing. Auditors would 
prepare an assessment report and send it to the Marine Stewardship Council that assesses the report. In case the report is approved, it is 
uploaded to the Council’s website for allowing public access. For Chain of Custody audits, there is a checklist for auditors. All data from Chain 
of Custody audits is however confidential due to agreements that the Marine Stewardship Council sets-up with clients.  • The Marine Stewardship Council is moving towards digital traceability systems for certifying supply chains and verifying the absence of illegal, 
unreported and unregulated fishing. Such a digital system would be able to integrate into any client’s current Information Technology system 
and facilitate data sharing. Data can be then digitally tracked and verified against the data collected by the client and against other sources of 
information such as a new vessel’s registry by the Food and Agriculture Organization. Information such as provenance can be captured in near 
real-time. Such a digital system is in the late design stage and is planned to be launched within the forthcoming two years.  • The Marine Stewardship Council is aware of the blockchain potential and has considered integrating blockchain into its digital system under 
development; however, the Council decided to delay this implementation due to high cost, high technology risk, and the long development time.  • Blockchain offers a unique opportunity to secure shared information. The information is neutral, distributed and cannot be orchestrated by one 
company. The Marine Stewardship Council is of the opinion that blockchain can amplify trust on fishermen and the certification per se. Although 
the Council had never come across concerns with regards to security, blockchain could be a disruptive technology for the certification 
organisation as the technology gains more trust over the organisation.  • The major weakness of blockchain is the cost of scalability. The cost would be too high for the fisheries’ industry since a fee/payment would be 
required for such a service.  • A key challenge of blockchain technology is consolidation of data and stakeholders’ collaboration. The Council revealed that there have been 
examples in other organisations where similar projects were unsuccessful because stakeholders did not collaborate. 


Tech Provider #1  • Tech Provider #1 has developed a pilot Electronic Catch Documentation Traceability system that has been implemented by some fishermen in 
Thailand.  • The developed Electronic Catch Documentation Traceability system can automatically record the date, time, location and speed of each vessel at 
any time. The system allows robust communication beyond 10 miles from the coastline (mobile telecommunication networks are not accessible 
beyond this point). The developed Electronic Catch Documentation Traceability system can also be used to record the amount of catch and 
automatically link this information to the catch location.  • The developed Electronic Catch Documentation Traceability system associates to significant investment cost. The installation cost is 
approximately THB 100,000 and the subscription cost, dependent on airtime, is approximately THB 4,000–5,000. 


Tech Provider #2  • Tech Provider #2 provides a cloud-based Enterprise Resource Planning solution through subscription by offering a full range of services for the 
entire value chain, including: Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points quality control; fishery quota; manufacturing management; financial 
management; business analytics; retail management; internal and external traceability etc. Data backup, updates, Structured Query Language 
database and security are also included. The installation can be done remotely and incurs minimal installation cost because software licenses 
and a centralised computer system are not required. Data can be entered using peripherals and scales. The information can be accessed 
anywhere in the world. The system can be customised according to customers’ requirements. 


Tech Provider #3  • Tech Provider #3 is a blockchain start-up company which offers solutions for pharmaceutical supply chains to comply to regulations, such as 
tracking temperatures and keeping a safe record.  • Tech Provider #3 has integrated Internet of Things with blockchain for automated and tamper-proof data collection by using temperature 
sensors during the transportation of pharmaceutical products with the information stored in the blockchain.  • Tech Provider #3 developed a web application and a dashboard control panel that analyses and presents data and information in real-time.  • Tech Provider #3 has included a module to monitor weather and uses Big Data and machine learning to create predictive models for better 
informed supply chain management.  • The blockchain implementation is only limited to transportation operations of medications and has not yet been integrated to other echelons of 
the pharmaceutical supply chain. 


Tech Provider #4  • Tech Provider #4 is an Information Technology consulting firm which has advised and assisted in the implementation of blockchain into 
supply chains.  • Tech Provider #4 recognises the beneficial role of blockchain for mutual stakeholders’ access to the same data without having to send data ‘back- 
and-forth’, especially in complex ecosystems.  • According to Tech Provider #4, benefits of blockchain include: auditability; tamper-proof data; decentralisation; proof-of-origin. Tampering can 
only be achieved in case the entire ecosystem fraudsters the digital platform at exactly the same time.
