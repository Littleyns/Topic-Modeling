The purpose of this paper is to provide a decision support system for managers to predict an organization’s 
probability of successful blockchain adoption using a machine learning technique. The study conceptualizes 
blockchain technology as a dynamic capability that should be possessed by the organization to remain 
competitive. The factors influencing the blockchain adoption behavior were modeled using the theoretical lens of 
the Technology Acceptance Model and Technology-organisation-Environment framework. The findings identify 
competitor pressure, partner readiness, perceived usefulness, and perceived ease of use as the most influencing 
factors for blockchain adoption. A predictive decision support system was developed using a Bayesian network 
analysis featuring the significant factors that can be used by the decision-makers for predicting the probability of 
blockchain adoption in their organization. The prior probability values reported in the study may be used as 
indicators by the practitioners to predict their blockchain adoption probability. The practitioner will be required 
to substitute these probability values (high or low), as applicable to their organization to estimate the adoption 
probability. The use of the decision support system is likely to help the decision-makers to assess their adoption 
probability and develop future adoption strategies.   


1. Introduction 


Organizations with effective supply chains are found to be highly 
efficient and responsive, and therefore, organizations are continuously 
in search of innovative technologies that facilitate efficiency improve-
ment within supply chains (Craighead et al. 2007). Given both changing 
consumers’ preferences and dynamic market competition, supply chains 
are becoming more complex. Factors such as the spread of organizations 
to different geographic locations, the increasing scope of operations, or 
unreliable demand patterns and product portfolios, give birth to chal-
lenges to these organizations for synchronizing their supply and demand 
plans (Ojha et al., 2018). Previous studies have shown that emerging 
technologies facilitates organizations to overcome such challenges 
through supply chain transformation (Long et al., 2017). Within a digital 
supply chain, the control of the supply chain must be shared across 


partners and not owned by a single company. Currently, traditional 
supply chains are facing various problems, including the issues of 
transparency, product traceability, and accountability (Min 2019). In 
such a context, blockchain technology is seen as one of the most 
promising information technology innovations that will bring enormous 
improvements to supply chain transactions (Lacity 2018; Kamble et al., 
2019; Pazaitis et al., 2017). Indeed, the Word Economic Forum considers 
blockchain to be among six computing “mega-trends” that are likely to 
shape the world in the next decade (World Economic Forum 2015). 
Blockchain technology provides the ability to store data in blocks, which 
are then added in chronological order, shared, and distributed to all 
concerned supply chain partners (Angelis and da Silva, 2019; Kshetri 
2017; Lacity 2018). Overall, blockchain architecture provides the op-
portunity for organizations to track and trace their products, providing a 
highly secured transaction environment helping to solve trust issues

((Kshetri, 2018). 
Blockchain technology is presently spreading across industries, and 


more and more organizations are exploring ways to match their capa-
bilities when adopting blockchain technology (Janssen et al., 2020). The 
technology adoption is defined as a sociological model that describes the 
adoption or acceptance of technology, according to the demographic 
and psychological characteristics of defined adopter groups (Rogers, 
1995). The demographic and psychological characteristics of the users 
influence the blockchain technology adoption in supply chains (Kamble 
et al., 2019; Queiroz and Fosso Wamba, 2019). Predominantly, block-
chain adoption is driven by the trust factor, which is linked to four areas, 
including enhanced visibility and traceability, supply chain digitization 
and disintermediation, improved data security, and smart contracts 
(Wang et al., 2018; Pereira et al., 2019). The blockchain has not yet 
reached its optimum maturity level, and organizations should conduct 
extensive feasibility studies before adoption (Kamble et al., 2019). 


Presently, most organizations are in the process of analyzing various 
factors leading to blockchain adoption, and therefore, it is essential to 
understand the way individuals behave when adopting such technolo-
gies and there is an urgent need to conduct research providing empirical 
evidence on blockchain adoption (Kamble et al., 2019; Queiroz and 
Fosso Wamba, 2019). Until recently, most of the studies on blockchain 
adoption have focused on developing theoretical frameworks and are 
conceptual (Durach et al., 2020; Min, 2019; Wang et al., 2018; Fran-
cisco and Swanson, 2018). There have been some efforts from the re-
searchers to develop and empirically validate frameworks based on 
Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (Kamble et al., 2019), the Unified 
Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) (Francisco and 
Swanson, 2018; Queiroz and Fosso Wamba, 2019; Clohessy et al., 2019). 
These empirical studies have used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) 
to analyze adoption behaviors. SEM fails to provide excellent manage-
rial decision support, given these models are based on linear relation-
ships resulting in poor diagnosis and prediction (Gupta and Kim 2008). 


Bayesian network analysis is similar to SEM and depicts the cause- 
effect is a relationship-based model (Malakmohammadi et al., 2009). 
Further, in Bayesian network analysis, causal dependencies between 
constructs are expressed using conditional probabilities based on his-
torical data (Castillo et al., 1997). Compared to SEM, the Bayesian 
network analysis can be used for prediction and diagnosis using new 
data on an already developed model and performs better in analyzing 
non-linear relationships. Nevertheless, the Bayesian network analysis 
has certain limitations. First, relationships are based on conditional 
probabilities using historical data, and therefore, it cannot differentiate 
between a causal relationship and a theoretically unsound relationship 
(Pearl 1998). Secondly, even if a theoretically sound structural model is 
forced as Bayesian network analysis, results will lack the ability to 
providing theoretical explanations (Anderson and Vastag, 2004). Lastly, 
the lack of ability to distinguish between latent variables and their 
measurement items (observed variables) is another significant limitation 
of using Bayesian network analysis. 


To overcome the limitations of the SEM and Bayesian network 
analysis, a two-stage integrated SEM, and Bayesian network analysis 
was proposed by Gupta and Kim (2008). This combined methodology 
considers a theoretically developed and empirically validated SEM 
model and Bayesian network analysis at the hypothetical variable level 
to build a prediction model. In this study, we extend the work of Gupta 
and Kim (2008) and use the SEM- Bayesian network to predict block-
chain adoption in India. The integrated methodology overcomes the 
significant limitations of the SEM and Bayesian network analysis and 
can be used for predicting the future probability of blockchain adoption. 


More specifically, the paper aims to explain the intent of blockchain 
adoption by using the psychological constructs from the literature on 
technology adoption and build a predictive model to estimate the 
probability of blockchain adoption. Our study is one of the preliminary 
studies on blockchain adoption that guides a widely accepted machine 
learning algorithm to predict the adoption behavior closely related to a 


theoretical model based on the extension of the TAM framework. In the 
following section, we present the conceptual background. Then, we 
present our research model, hypotheses development, and methodology 
of our study. In the final section, the findings, conclusion, limitations, 
and future research of blockchain adoption are discussed. 


2. Conceptual background 


2.1. Blockchain technology in supply chain 


In a blockchain, transactions are recorded and maintained in real- 
time in an audit-proof manner, and changes are authenticated based 
on the consensus of the parties involved in transactions. Once trans-
actions are approved by all concerned parties (nodes), it cannot be 
modified or deleted, which provides the benefits of data integrity and 
security. Increased safety, transparency, traceability, and efficiency in 
supply chain transactions can be achieved through blockchain adoption 
(Kamble et al., 2019; Kshetri 2018). Blockchain deployment outside 
finance services has been mostly experimental (Kshetri 2018), and 
emphasis has been on blockchain technology itself rather than on the 
issues of selection and adoption (Angelis and da Silva, 2019). With this 
in mind, blockchain also offers increased supply chain integration, 
which leads to a better overall supply chain performance (Kshetri 2018). 
Kshetri and Loukoianova (2019) report that existing technology may be 
economically beneficial for high-value products and present challenges 
for deploying it for low priced products. The supply chain enabled with 
blockchain technology leads to increased customer confidence by 
providing them the benefits of real-time tracking of the products, 
reduction in product movement costs, highly secured transactions, and 
protect product counterfeiting (Kamble et al., 2020). In this study, the 
underpinning theory used to conceptualize blockchain technology is the 
dynamic capability theory. 


2.1.1. Dynamic capability theory 
Blockchain technology configures the supply chain resources and 


enables the members to co-create value by executing assigned tasks with 
increased transparency and speed (Perks et al., 2017). In this study, we 
conceptualize blockchain technology using the dynamic capability 
theory (Teece et al., 1997). Teece et al., p.516) define dynamic capa-
bility as “the firm’s ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal 
and external competences to address rapidly changing environments.” 
Dynamic capability enhances the firm’s ability to make decisions, solve 
problems, identify opportunities and threats, and modify existing re-
sources (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000). The dynamic capability theory 
suggests that organizations can create ‘value’ by modifying supply chain 
processes and resources. Increased supply chain transparency, immu-
tability, privacy, reliability, and trustworthiness are the principal 
drivers of blockchain technology (Kamble et al., 2019). These block-
chain technology capabilities are expected to provide a competitive 
advantage in terms of reduced transaction-based costs, the addition of 
new products and services, delineating the organizational boundaries, 
automation, and decentralization of supply chain decision making 
(Angelis and da Silva, 2019; Pereira et al., 2019). 


2.2. Blockchain technology adoption 


The literature on blockchain suggests various drivers of blockchain 
adoption that includes a secured and decentralized database, anonymity 
of transactions, use of smart contracts, reduced transaction costs, and 
product traceability. Although the blockchain adoption drivers provide 
various benefits, blockchain adoption within supply chains is still in its 
infancy stage (Angelis and da Silva, 2019; Queiroz and Fosso Wamba, 
2019). Some barriers exist to the successful implementation of block-
chain technology adoption. These include issues related to lack of suc-
cessful validations (Leung, 2016), integration challenges with existing 
legacy systems (Mougayar, 2017; Earls, 2016), scalability (Eyal et al., 


S.S. Kamble et al.

2016), lack of computing power (Bentov et al., 2016), and regulatory 
and legal governance systems (Duhaime, 2014). Blockchain adoption is 
expected to bring significant improvements to all business processes for 
all supply chain participants. 


The extant literature details various technology adoption frame-
works aiming to analyze users’ adoption behavior including the Tech-
nology Acceptance Model (TAM) (Davis, 1989), Theory of Planned 
Behavior (TPB) (Ajzen, 1987), and UTAT (Venkatesh et al., 2012). 
Previous studies have referred to these frameworks in combination to 
develop more profound insights on adoption behaviors such as the UTAT 
framework by Queiroz and Fosso Wamba (2019). It was used to estimate 
the blockchain adoption behavior between supply chain professionals in 
India and the USA. The integrated TAM, TPB framework by Kamble 
et al. (2019) was used to analyze the blockchain adoption behavior of 
supply chain professionals in India. However, the existing blockchain 
adoption studies focus on analyzing the individual’s intent to adopt the 
blockchain rather than an organizational perspective. Additionally, the 
literature suggests that blockchain adoption faces numerous challenges, 
such as compatibility issues with the existing system, complexity of the 
supply chain, high implementation costs, and availability of skilled 
technical human resources (Wang et al., 2018). Therefore, it becomes 
necessary that blockchain adoption models analyze these factors from 
an institutional perspective to identify significant factors that lead to 
supply chain blockchain adoption. 


Additional studies are required to develop a comprehensive under-
standing of blockchain adoption process drivers. A review of recent 
studies analyzing the adoption behavior of information technology 
products reveals a clear focus on integrating different adoption models 
to come up with a more comprehensive understanding of customers’ 
intent to adopt the technology (Kamble et al., 2019; Queiroz and Fosso 
Wamba, 2019). Therefore, in this study, we use a combination of the 
TAM and Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework to 
conceptualize the blockchain adoption model. 


2.2.1. Technology acceptance model 
The primary objective of the present study is to understand the 


behavioral process of blockchain adoption within organizations. Many 
organizations are already implementing the Internet of Things and big 
data technologies. Should these organizations be moving forward on 
blockchain adoption? It is essential to understand how these organiza-
tions perceive blockchain technology in terms of usefulness and ease of 
use. Accepting the blockchain will, in turn, expedite their adoption 
process. Therefore, we have used the perceived usefulness and ease of 
use as two primary attributes of the adoption process, which is repre-
sented by the TAM model (Davis, 1989; Pattansheti et al., 2016). 


2.2.2. Technology, organization and environment framework 
The TOE framework considers factors under the dimension of tech-


nology, organization, and environment, which influence the adoption of 
innovative technology at the institutional level (DePietro et al., 1990). 
The technology dimension considers the influence of technical charac-
teristics such as infrastructure, quality, and integration on technology 
adoption. The organizational aspect of technology adoption include 
factors such as organizational structure, decision-making capabilities, 
and management support. Factors related to the influence external 
parties have on adoption - such as government regulations, supplier 
support, competitive pressure - are included in the environmental 
dimension. The TOE is found to be the most robust and widely used 
adoption model in the information systems literature compared to TAM, 
TRA, TPB, and IDT, which are focused on analyzing the technology 
adoption behavior at the individual user’s level rather than at the 
organizational level (Gangwar et al., 2015; Awa et al., 2016). Hence, we 
conceptualize our research framework on the integration of the TAM 
and TOE framework. The proposed combination addresses the need for 
more research on blockchain adoption from both individual and insti-
tutional perspectives. 


2.3. Bayesian network analysis 


The Bayesian network analysis follows the ‘Bayes Theorem’ by rep-
resenting causal dependencies of events in a probabilistic network using 
conditional probabilities (Castillo et al., 1997). The nodes of the prob-
abilistic network represent uncertain variables whereas, the edges of the 
network represent the causal relationships between two nodes, forming 
an acyclic directed graph. The node with a parent is referred to as a leaf 
node, and the node without a parent is called a root node (Aguilera et al., 
2011). Compared to other graphical methods such as social network 
analysis and interpretive structural modeling, the Bayesian network 
analysis captures the power of relationships between nodes. Therefore, 
Bayesian network analysis can be used for testing hypotheses (Qazi 
et al., 2018). Moreover, the Bayesian network analysis offers the 
advantage of combining multiple information sources, structural 
learning possibilities, and efficiently dealing with uncertainty (Minana 
et al., 2012). Furthermore, the Bayesian network analysis offers a high 
level of flexibility in updating the conditional probabilities, incorpo-
rating expert knowledge, and changing the nodes based on suggestion or 
need (Gupta and Kim, 2008). 


The artificial neural network is the other widely used machine 
learning technique that identifies the non-compensatory and non-linear 
relationships in the research models (Leong et al., 2015). The literature 
supports the use of the artificial neural network in producing more ac-
curate predictions compared to the traditional regression-based tech-
niques (Chiang et al., 2006; Leong et al., 2013). The artificial neural 
networks are known to use a “hill-climbing” approach to learning from 
the data and are found to be useful in analyzing complex problems when 
little prior knowledge of the input variables is known, and internal 
system operation is available (Schalkoff, 1992). However, artificial 
neural networks fail to provide the reasoning process to human under-
standing, and the decision-makers cannot be specific on what the arti-
ficial neural network has learned (Diederich, 1992). The decision-maker 
faces difficulty act on an outcome without knowing how the result has 
arrived (Teach and Shortliffe, 1981). Also, the robustness of the artificial 
neural network-based models may be significantly deteriorated due to 
the possible overfitting of data. 


Recently, Wong et al. (2019) used an artificial neural network-based 
methodology to analyze blockchain adoption in supply chains based on 
the TOE framework. As compared to the artificial neural network, the 
Bayesian network analysis provide detailed reasoning in the form of 
probabilities for the obtained results and avoids the risk of overfitting 
the data (Mitchell, 1997). The literature suggests that the Bayesian 
network analysis might outperform the artificial neural networks in 
small data settings. Artificial neural networks, especially the ones with 
more layers, are very well known to be data-hungry demanding massive 
datasets to train them properly (Correa et al., 2009). 


As the present study aims to understand the blockchain adoption 
behavior in supply chains, practitioners need to understand the 
reasoning behind the causal relationships rather than a mere association 
of data and assumptions. Therefore, we feel that the present study will 
contribute in terms of extending the work carried by Wong et al. (2019) 
by deploying an integrated TAM-TOE framework using a Bayesian 
network methodology to overcome the limitations of the artificial neural 
network. 


3. Research framework 


Blockchain adoption is a complex process as it is not only dependent 
on adequate infrastructure; it also requires addressing integration 
challenges with existing legacy systems. Blockchain must adhere to the 
legal and regulatory governance systems. Perceived usefulness is found 
to be an important mediating variable influencing the relationship be-
tween the perceived ease of use and intention to adopt blockchain in the 
supply chain (Kamble et al., 2019). The literature suggests that the 
predictive power of a TOE model can be extensively improved by 


S.S. Kamble et al.

integrating it with other models, as the constructs of the TOE model are 
too generic and unclear (Wang et al., 2010; Gangwar et al., 2015). These 
reasons have motivated researchers to use an integrated TAM-TOE 
framework to assess blockchain technology adoption behavior of 
users. The constructs selected in the present study and the relationships 
emerging from the literature form the basis of our hypothesis develop-
ment and the proposed conceptual framework. Understanding block-
chain adoption within supply chains may be of great strategic value to 
decision-makers to plan their adoption process. This will not only help 
supply chain practitioners, but also provide meaningful insights to both 
vendors and strategic partners. 


3.1. Technological factors 


Various technological factors are hypothesized to influence block-
chain technology adoption, including; relative advantage, information 
security, technical know-how, perceived financial costs, compatibility, 
and complexity. We will explain these below. 


3.1.1. Relative advantage 
Relative advantage is defined as “the degree to which an innovation 


is perceived as being better than the idea it supersedes” (Rogers, 1995, p. 
219). The relative advantage increases the probability of innovative 
technologies adoption (Gangwar et al., 2015). The Blockchain offers the 
highest level of product traceability and provenance with the use of 
trusted information as compared to the other technologies (Wang et al., 
2018). Previous studies have shown that relative advantage is positively 
related to the perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness (Davis 
1989; DePietro et al., 1990; Gangwar et al., 2015). 


Therefore, we hypothesize that: 


H1a. Relative advantage positively influences the perceived ease of 
use. 


H1b. Relative advantage positively influences perceived usefulness. 


3.1.2. Information security 
Information security is defined as “the ability to protect stake-


holder’s information and their transaction data during transmission” 
(Hua, 2009). Blockchain technology offers a high level of IS through 
unique features such as a secured database (Huckle et al., 2016) and a 
privacy-preserving framework (Ouaddah et al., 2017). Blockchain 
technology offers users the opportunity to not revealing their identity 
while performing transactions. However, when blockchain is used 
within a supply chain, the technology requires user information to be 
shared with their partners, and hence the information is available for 
scrutiny. The literature identifies information security threats to influ-
ence the adoption of technology (Limthongchai and Speece, 2003; Bel-
khamza and Wafa, 2009). The user becomes more hesitant to share 
information because of information security issues, thereby affecting 
their perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness (Khan and Salah, 
2017; Al-Saqaf and Seidler, 2017). Information security is posited to 
directly influence the user’s perceived ease of use and perceived use-
fulness of the technology (Al-Omari et al., 2012). 


Therefore, we hypothesize that: 


H2a. Information security positively influences the perceived ease of 
use. 


H2b. Information security positively influences perceived usefulness. 


3.1.3. Technical know-how 
Technical know-how refers to the organization’s ability in terms of 


the availability of technically skilled experts and consultants to guide 
blockchain implementation and operations (Eze et al., 2013). Lack of 
awareness and absence of technical know-how is found to hinder the 
blockchain adoption, as it is difficult for an organization to adopt 


something which is not entirely understood (White, 2017). The avail-
ability of technical know-how drives the perceived usefulness of the 
technology. The user’s technical knowledge in using the technology 
reduces the complexities making it effortless (Davis, 1989; Lu et al., 
2003). 


Therefore, we hypothesize that: 


H3a. Technical know-how positively influences the perceived ease of 
use. 


H3b. Technical know-how positively influences the perceived 
usefulness. 


3.1.4. Perceived financial benefits 
Perceived financial benefit refers to the implementation and opera-


tional costs of the technology and the monetary benefit derived from it 
(Lee et al., 2012). Blockchain features such as a decentralized and shared 
database reduce the number of intermediaries resulting in reduced 
transaction costs (Iansiti and Lakhani, 2017; Kshetri, 2017). Third-party 
intermediaries are no longer required in a blockchain-based system, and 
the transactions can be initiated and carried from peer to peer. The or-
ganizations realize cost benefits and improved flexibility, as many 
manual tasks can be automatically executed through smart contracts 
(Kamble et al., 2019). Compared to traditional supply chains, 
blockchain-driven supply chains are reported to have lower overhead 
costs (Sikorski et al., 2017). Perceived financial benefits are related to 
the perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness of new technologies. 
That is, customers’ perceived financial benefit influences judgment of 
the usefulness of a technology. If the perceived financial benefit is high, 
then the user perceives the technology as very useful (Lee et al., 2012). 


Therefore, we hypothesize that: 


H4a. Perceived financial benefits positively influence the perceived 
ease of use. 


H4b. Perceived financial benefits positively influence perceived 
usefulness. 


3.1.5. Compatibility 
Compatibility is defined as “the degree to which an innovation is 


perceived as consistent with the existing values, past experiences, and 
needs of potential adopters” (Rogers, 1995, p.38, 39). Blockchain plat-
forms are based on specific distributed ledger technology that is char-
acterized by different governance structures (de Filippi and Mcmullen, 
2018). While selecting the distributed ledger technology during block-
chain implementation, companies should check whether they are 
compatible with various supported financial services and products and 
meet regulatory requirements. The part of governance structure evolu-
tion is complicated, with a wide variety of blockchain applications based 
on different platforms. Further, there are various features and protocols 
for the open-source public and private blockchain with potentially 
different applications (Mthethwa, 2016). The previous studies suggest 
that a high level of compatibility of the new technology with existing 
systems will influence the perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness 
(Calisir et al., 2009; Gangwar et al., 2015). 


Therefore, we hypothesize that: 


H5a. Compatibility positively influences the perceived ease of use. 


H5b. Compatibility positively influences perceived usefulness. 


3.1.6. Complexity 
Complexity refers to “the perceived difficulty of learning to use and 


understand a new system or technology” (Sonnenwald et al., 2001, 
p.115). The significant sources of complexity in a blockchain system are

and lack of computing power (Bentov et al., 2016). Scalability refers to

the very high velocity of data generation with an increasing number of 
transactions making the blockchain heavy. The previous literature on 
perceived complexity claims that a high level of complexity influences 
the perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness (Gangwar et al., 
2015; Parveen and Sulaiman, 2008). 


Therefore, we hypothesize that: 


H6a. Complexity negatively influences the perceived ease of use. 


H6b. Complexity negatively influences perceived usefulness. 


3.2. Organizational factors 


3.2.1. Organizational readiness 
Organizational readiness measures the manager’s perception of his 


organization’s competency to adopt the technology based on the judg-
ment of various criteria such as awareness, resources, commitment, and 
governance (Tan et al. 2007). This criterion is mainly focused on 
financial readiness (Musawa and Wahab, 2012; Oliveira and Martins, 
2010). A high level of organizational readiness positively influences the 
perceived use of technology (Gangwar et al., 2015). Therefore, we hy-
pothesize the following: 


H7. Organisational readiness positively influences perceived 
usefulness. 


3.2.2. Top management support 
Raghunathan and Raghunathan (1988) explain top management 


support as the degree to which top management understands the stra-
tegic importance of information system function and is involved in in-
formation system activities. Top management support provides a 
compelling vision to help an organization to overcome any barrier and 
create an environment of commitment and innovation (Wang et al., 
2010). Top management support is found to influence the perceived ease 
of use and perceived usefulness (Gangwar et al., 2015). 


Therefore, we hypothesize the following: 


H8a. Top management support positively influences the perceived 
ease of use. 


H8b. Top management support positively influences perceived 
usefulness. 


3.2.3. Training and education 
The adoption of any new technology is hindered due to the non- 


availability of skilled human resources (Kamble et al., 2018). The 
shortage of technically skilled workforce to implement and operate 
blockchain technology has directed many organizations to create a 
talent pool by hiring and training people (Rizzo, 2016). Proper training 
and education will help the employees to use the technology better and 
acknowledge the perceived usefulness (White 2017; Kamble et al., 
2019). 


Therefore, we hypothesize that; 


H9a. Training & education positively influence the perceived ease of 
use. 


H9b. Training & education positively influence perceived usefulness. 


3.3. Environmental factors 


3.3.1. Partner readiness 
The successful implementation of the blockchain depends on the 


level of supply chain integration achieved with existing supply chain 
partners (Queiroz and Fosso Wamba, 2019). The partners’ willingness 
and cooperation to be part of the blockchain initiative is a highly critical 
element of implementation and is not possible with flawed relationships 
between them (Mougayar 2017; Earls, 2016). The literature indicates 


that an organization that adopts an innovation would expect their 
partners to possess a similar innovation process to fully utilize the 
innovation at an inter-organizational level (Hameed and Counsell, 
2012). We assume that the partner readiness level will have a positive 
influence on blockchain technology. 


Therefore, we hypothesize that: 


H10. Partner readiness has a positive influence on blockchain 
adoption. 


3.3.2. Competitive pressure 
Competitive pressure refers to the degree of pressure that a company 


feels from competitors within the industry (Zhu and Kraemer, 2005). 
Modern technologies provide leverage to supply chains to achieve a 
competitive advantage over competitors. Blockchain technology offers 
an opportunity for supply chains to create various sharing applications 
such as peer-to-peer automatic payment mechanisms, foreign exchange 
platforms, digital rights management, and cultural heritage (Huckle 
et al., 2016). Most companies would like to reap such benefits in the 
ever-increasing competitive market (Haoyan et al., 2017). By adoption 
of information systems, the organizations might be able to alter rules of 
the competition and leverage new ways to outperform their competitors, 
thereby changing the competitive structure in the industry (Porter and 
Millar, 1985). It is assumed that the organizations adopting blockchain 
technology will gain competitive advantages over their competitors. 


Therefore we hypothesize that; 


H11. CP has a positive influence on the blockchain adoption. 


3.4. TAM factors 


The intention to adopt blockchain technology is influenced by 
perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. Perceived usefulness 
measures the extent to which the prospective user perceives the block-
chain adoption will increase the organizational performance (Davis, 
1989). 


3.4.1. Perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use 
TAM proposes that the constructs perceived usefulness, perceived 


ease of use, and the technology adoption are related (Davis, 1989). The 
perceived ease of use positively influences the perceived usefulness 
because technologies requiring fewer efforts can be more useful (Kam-
ble et al., 2019; Gangwar et al., 2015). Several research studies have 
identified the perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness as primary 
predictors of technology adoption (Davis, 1989; Venkatesh and Morris 
2000). We assume these behavioral relationships would be applicable in 
blockchain technology adoption. 


Therefore we hypothesize that; 


H12. Perceived ease of use positively influences the perceived 
usefulness. 


H13. Perceived ease of use positively influences blockchain adoption. 


H14. Perceived usefulness positively influences the blockchain 
adoption. 


The research framework based on the above hypothesis is presented 
in Fig. 1. 


4. Research design 


The study used primary survey data from Indian manufacturing 
firms. Collected data were tested for statistical validity before using SEM 
and Bayesian network analysis.

4.1. Survey instrument 


The measurement scales for the constructs used in the study were 
developed from the existing studies in the literature (Gangwar et al., 
2015; Kamble et al., 2019; Awa et al., 2016). The selected scales were 
modified to suit the present context of blockchain adoption in 
manufacturing supply chains. The modifications were based on a 
consultation process with both industry and academic experts. The 
expert panel included a total of twenty-five members, including nine 
senior supply chain executives, five senior system integrators, five senior 
consultants working in the domain of IT applications in supply chains, 
three academicians from computer science engineering, three from 
supply chain management. Experts also suggested changes in the 
grammar, wording, sequencing, and language based on their under-
standing of the scales and what these scales intended to measure. These 
suggestions have ensured the construct validity of the survey instrument 
used for the study. The final measurement scale used for this study is 
given in table 2. 


4.2. Survey design and sample 


As the blockchain adoption is done at the organizational level, the 
unit of analysis is chosen as an individual manufacturing firm. The 
blockchain is expected to facilitate internal and external supply chain 
integration using a single platform. The decision related to blockchain 
adoption is at the organizational level, and hence we assume that using 
individual manufacturing firms as the unit of analysis was appropriate. 
Data for the study were collected from two significant industrial clusters 
in India, namely: Mumbai-Pune and Bangalore –Chennai. Participating 
companies belong to the automobile, chemical, and pharmaceutical 
industries. Mumbai and Bangalore are the renowned pharmaceutical 
and chemical manufacturing hubs. Pune has more than 750 large and 
medium-sized automobile component manufacturing companies 
(Pugaokar, 2015); and Chennai is the country’s largest automotive 
exporter (Menon, 2010) and Mumbai. The online survey questionnaire 
was sent to 650 respondents representing 300 companies (on average, 
two respondents from each company). The respondents have partici-
pated in the survey voluntarily, and follow-up reminders were sent at 


regular intervals. Overall, completed responses were received from 289 
respondents (success rate: 44.46%), representing 181 companies (suc-
cess rate: 60%). On average, 1.60 respondents participated in the survey. 
The survey responses for each company were averaged to obtain a single 
response for each company (Venkatraman and Grant, 1986). Hence, all 
statistical analysis was performed on an adequate sample size of 181 
manufacturing organizations. Previous studies investigating the pre-
dictive behavioral networks based on technology adoption frameworks 
using machine learning algorithms such as artificial neural network and 
principal component analysis have used similar sample sizes (such as 
Wong et al., 2019; Kalinić et al., 2019; Tan et al., 2014; 
Liébana-Cabanillas et al., 2018). Compared to artificial neural networks, 
Bayesian network analysis is evaluated based on conditional probabili-
ties, performs well in small data settings, and does not require consid-
erable datasets to train them, suggesting that the adequacy of selected 
sample size (Mitchell, 1997; Correa et al., 2009). Further, The sample 
size of 181 manufacturing units was found to be enough to perform the 
Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and SEM considering resource 
constraints in collecting pieces of information and emerging topic such 
as blockchain adoption in supply chains (Wolf et al., 2013; Sideridis 
et al., 2014; Hair et al., 2014). The power analysis (1-β) was computed to 
test the appropriateness of the sample size (Cohen, 1992). The post-doc 
analysis performed on G*Power 3.1.9.7 for a sample size of 181 at a 
significance level of 0.05 and an effect size of 0.10 resulted in the power 
of 0.99, which is above the recommended cut-off of 0.80 (Cohen, 1992). 


The demographic details of the selected sample are shown in Table 1. 
The online survey methodology adopted for this study has eliminated 


the issue of missing values and incomplete questionnaires, given the 
final submission of the online form was allowed only after filling re-
sponses to all questions. However, any influence of time lag that was 
observed, leading to early and the submissions of questionnaires was 
evaluated, treating them as non-response bias (Oppenheim, 1966). Out 
of the 289 questionnaires, 105 were received in the first six weeks, 45 
were received between week six to week ten, and the remaining 31 
questionnaires after ten weeks. The total duration of the study was 
fifteen weeks, starting from 10th October 2018.

4.3. Methods 


A two-stage integrated research methodology was used to develop 
the behavioral predictive blockchain adoption model. The stage-I of the 
research was focused on validating the measurement items used for the 
study and testing the statistical significance of the proposed structural 
framework, as shown in Fig. 1. In stage-II, Bayes network methodology 
was applied to the validated structural model to develop a predictive 
blockchain adoption model. The research methods used in these two 
stages are discussed below. 


4.3.1. Convergent and discriminant validity test 
The validity of the collected data was performed to test the presence 


of non-response bias, common method bias, and normality of the data. 
One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze the pres-
ence of non-response bias. The difference in the means of three groups 
created on time lags in the submission of completed questionnaires was 
used as the basis for comparison. The presence of common method bias 
(CMB) was tested using Harman’s single factor score as per the guide-
lines suggested by Podsakoff and Organ (1986). The normality of the 
data was ascertained using the Kurtosis and Skewness values (Curran 
et al., 1996). The convergent and discriminant validity of the mea-
surement items was confirmed through the values of factor loadings, 
composite scale reliability (CSR), and average variance extracted (AVE). 
The convergent validity was confirmed on satisfying the following 
threshold values; factor loadings greater than 0.5 (Hair et al., 2014), CSR 
values above 0.70 (Hair et al., 2014; Gefen et al., 2000), and the average 
variance extracted (AVE) values above 0.50 (Hair et al., 2014; Fornell 
and Larcker, 1981). The Chi-square value (χ2), degree of freedom (df), 
Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), and Root Mean 
Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) were used to test the 


hypothesized measurement model (Fan et al., 2016; Hu and Bentler, 
1999). 


4.3.2. Structural equation modelling 
The proposed structural model, as shown in Fig. 1 was analyzed 


using the maximum likelihood estimation method in AMOS 24. The 
SEMs models estimate the cause and effect relationships between a set of 
multivariate data. SEM uses latent variables to model the classical 
measurement error model for predictors and random-effects model for 
multivariate outcomes (Sanchez et al., 2005). The SEM technique in-
volves two main phases. In phase I, the factors defining the latent var-
iables are validated (as explained in Section 4.3.2). Phase II evaluates 
the model fit of the structural model to test the statistical relevance of 
the model (Jenatabadi, 2015). However, the SEM has limited utility for 
managers due to the inability to act as a decision support system that can 
be used for further diagnosis and prediction of the dependent variables 
(Gupta and Kim, 2008). 


4.3.3. Bayesian network 
In this stage, we adopted a Bayesian network analysis for developing 


and validating our proposed predictive blockchain adoption model 
(Gupta and Kim, 2008). The development of a structural model, on the 
one hand, and estimating prior conditional probabilities, on the other 
hand, are the two critical steps in developing a Bayesian network 
(Heckerman, 1999). 


The latent variable scores of the significant constructs in the struc-
tural model were estimated and used as the data for learning the con-
ditional probabilities. The use of latent scores ensured that the two 
modeling approaches did not differ much due to the lack of factor de-
terminacy (Steiger, 1996). The latent scores were calculated as per 
guidelines suggested by Joreskog (2000) using AMOS software. Latent 
variable scores support the testing of non-linear relationships between 
the latent variables (Joreskog, 2000). The latent variable scores are best 
suited to test the Bayesian networks in their functional form and 
represent non-linear relationships. 


In SEM, the measurement model for exogenous variables is given as, 
x = Axξ + δ where, x is the individual items for independent variables, ξ 
is the latent variable corresponding to the item x, Ax is the standardized 
coefficient of relationship between x and ξ. The measurement error term 
x is represented by δ. 


The latent scores ξ for each observation in the sample are calculated 
based on the estimation of the coefficients by minimizing the equation

i=1(xi− Axξi)Tθ

δ (xi − Axξi), Subject to the constraint: (1/N) 


∑N

T
i = φ. 


Where N is the sample size, θδ is the covariance matrix of residual 
errors, Φ is the covariance matrix of the latent variables, and the 
transpose of the computed matrix is represented by T. 


The significant latent constructs in the model were first discretized 
into two categories (low and high), and the probabilities were manually 
estimated by occurrence frequency. The two-category discretization 
(low and high) was performed in Rapidminer Studio 8.0, using the 
Discretize by Binning operator. This operator discretizes the selected 
numerical attributes to nominal attributes. The number of bins parameter 
is used to specify the required number of bins. This discretization was 
performed by simple binning. The range of numerical values is parti-
tioned into segments of equal size. 


5. Analysis and findings 


5.1. Measurement model 


The ANOVA test revealed no significant differences in the mean 
values on the selected constructs across the three groups established on 
the questionnaire submission timeline indicating the absence of non- 
response bias. The Harmon’s single factor test to test the common

method bias revealed that the maximum amount of variance explained 
by a single factor was 41.2%, which implies that the common method 
bias was not a significant issue in this study. The absolute values for 
Skewness and Kurtosis were within the threshold limits of 2 and 7, 
suggesting the data was normal (Curran et al., 1996; Ryu, 2011). The 
mean values, standard deviation, Skewness, and Kurtosis values are 
shown in Table 2. 


To test the reliability and validity of the measurement items, various 
measures that included exploratory factor analysis, Composite Scale 
Reliability (CSR), Average Variance Extracted (AVE) were used. As 
shown in Table 2, factor loading values for the measurement items were 
higher than the threshold of 0.50 (Hair et al., 2014). The CSR values 
were also found to be above the threshold of 0.70 establishing adequate 
internal consistency of the measurement items (Gefen et al., 2000). AVE 
values for all constructs were higher than the threshold of 0.5, except for 
the construct organizational readiness signifying convergent validity 
issue (Hair et al., 2014). In table 3, we have compared the correlation 
coefficients between constructs with the diagonal elements of the matrix 
representing the squared roots of the construct’s AVE. The comparison 
reveals that correlation coefficients of one construct with the other 
construct are lower than the squared roots of the construct’s AVE, 
signifying no discriminant validity issues except for the construct 
organizational readiness (Hair et al., 2014). The construct organiza-
tional readiness was dropped from further analysis due to the biasness of 
the respondents. 


The Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) of the measurement model 
suggested a satisfactory fit with the values for model fit indices of χ2/df 
=1.679 (2017.76/1233), RMSEA=0.061, CFI=0.936, and TLI=0.929 
(Fan et al., 2016; Hu and Bentler, 1999). Next, the model was tested for 
estimating the hypothesized relationships. The results of the SEM 
analysis are summarized in table 4. 


5.2. SEM results 


The proposed structural model, as shown in Fig. 1 was analyzed 
using the maximum likelihood estimation method in AMOS 24. The 
estimates of the validated SEM model and the results of the hypothesis 
are summarized and shown in table 4. 


In this stage, we tested the hypothesis that was developed based on 
the theoretical foundations in the literature. All the hypotheses were 
examined using the SEM approach. The results found that information 
security was an insignificant variable and had no influence on the 
perceived ease of use and the perceived usefulness (H2a and H2a). The 
finding was inconsistent with the existing literature (Awa et al., 2016; 
Gangwar et al., 2015; Belkhamza and Wafa, 2009). This may be because 
the supply chain practitioners know the primary value offered by 
blockchain technology is transparent transactions, the anonymity of 
transactions, smart contracts, and product traceability. The relative 
advantage was found to have a significant relationship with the 
perceived usefulness (H2b), which found support in the literature 
(Kamble et al., 2019; Gangwar et al., 2015; Musawa and Wahab, 2012). 
However, the influence of relative advantage on perceived ease of use 
(H1b) deviated from the findings in the literature showing an insignif-
icant relationship. This implies that the practitioners perceive that the 
benefits offered by blockchain adoption will make their existing pro-
cesses more efficient. The organizations tend to perceive blockchain’s 
usefulness when they find that it provides them a relative advantage 
over the existing applications. However, they perceive it will not be easy 
to use this technology compared to the current systems. 


The technical know-how was found to have a significant influence on 
the perceived ease of use (H3a). The survey respondents in our study had 
a technical background and were eager to learn and adopt blockchain 
technology in their organizations (Wong et al., 2020; Kamble et al., 
2019; Queiroz and Fosso Wamba et al., 2019). The organizations 
believed that the perceived financial benefits that will be accrued from 
blockchain adoption would influence the perceived ease of use (H4a)

supporting the findings of the other studies (Wong et al., 2020; Iansiti 
and Lakhani, 2017; Gangwar et al., 2015). The organizations also 
perceived that the less complex technologies would improve the 
perceived ease of use, thus leading to increased adoption of the block-
chain (H6a). This finding found support in the literature (Wong et al., 
2020; Parveen and Sulaiman, 2008; Ramdani et al., 2009; Wang et al., 
2010). However, our study reported that the less complex technologies 
are insignificant in influencing the perceived usefulness deviating from 
the existing literature (Gangwar et al., 2015; Parveen and Sulaiman, 
2008). 


The training & education representing the organizational factor was 
found to have a positive and significant influence on perceived ease of 
use and perceived usefulness, accepting the hypothesis H9a and H9b. 
The finding implies that with the increased technical knowledge of the 
employees on the deployment of blockchain technology, the organiza-
tions feel it is easier for them to use blockchain technology in the supply 
chain and convince them of its utility. The organizations should develop 
continuous training and education modules on how the blockchain 
technology can be deployed and its benefits to provide a sense of ease 
and usefulness in the minds of the employee. The finding found support 
in the literature and was consistent with HYPERLINK \l "bib133" Wong 
et al., (2020); White (2017); Kamble et al., (2019), and Awa et al. 
(2016). 


The results confirmed the positive and significant influence of the 
compatibility on perceived usefulness, establishing the hypothesis H5b, 
which implies that compatibility of the blockchain with the existing 
technologies in the organizations will improve its utility. This finding is 
consistent with the other studies in the literature (Gangwar et al., 2015; 
Calisir et al., 2009). Further, the perceived ease of use was found to 
influence the perceived usefulness (H12). The finding implies that the 
perceived usefulness of the blockchain increases with increased ease of 
use of the technology. This is consistent with the studies conducted by 
Davis (1989), Venkatesh and Morris (2000), and Kamble et al., (2019). 


Further, both the TAM constructs viz., perceived ease of use, and 
perceived usefulness were found to have a positive influence on inten-
tion to adopt blockchain technology accepting the hypothesis H13 and 
H14. The findings were supported by the studies in the existing litera-
ture (Kamble et al., 2019; Gangwar et al., 2015; Davis, 1989; Venkatesh 
and Morris, 2000) indicating that the perceived usefulness and 
perceived ease of use are the significant antecedents to the blockchain 
adoption. Partner readiness was found to be significant in influencing 
the blockchain adoption (H10). Blockchain technology needs to be 
implemented across the supply chain requiring massive support from all 
the supply chain partners. This finding is supported in the literature by 
many other studies conducted in different contexts (Queiroz and Fosso

Wamba, 2019; Lin and Lin, 2008; Oliveira and Martins, 2010). Finally, 
the competitive pressure was found to be one of the most critical factors 
influencing the blockchain adoption (H11). This finding found support 
in the literature form other studies (Low et al., 2011; Oliveira and 
Martins, 2010) but was inconsistent with a few studies (Ramdani et al., 
2009). The positive influence of competitive pressure on blockchain 
technology indicates that blockchain technology is perceived by the 
organizations as a strategic necessity and critical innovation for survival. 


The findings on the TAM and T-O-E factors imply that the blockchain 
adoption is not only dependent on the usefulness and ease of use of the 
technology, which is highly influenced by the technological and orga-
nizational factors within the control of the organization but is also 
subjected to externally uncontrollable factors such as competitive 
pressures and the readiness of the supply chain partners to adopt the 
technology. 


5.2.1. Mediation analysis 
The mediation analysis was performed using the user-defined esti-


mands in the software AMOS 24.0 as per the guidelines suggested by 
Arbuckle (2014) and Hayes and Scharkow(2013). The results revealed 


that the mediation effects were statistically significant (at 0.05) except 
for the single level mediation between top management support, 
perceived usefulness, and blockchain adoption with an estimate of 
-0.008 and a p-value of 0.417. The finding indicates that the perceived 
usefulness of blockchain technology may be influenced by the top 
management support to use blockchain in the organization; however, 
this may not translate in blockchain adoption by the organization. 
Therefore, the top management support is limited in developing 
perceived usefulness (H8b) and does not have an indirect influence on 
blockchain adoption. The results of the mediation analysis are presented 
in Table 5. 


5.3. Results of the Bayesian network analysis 


The observed prior conditional probabilities obtained for the con-
structs using the steps outlined in Section 4.3.2 are shown in table 6. 


Next, the conditional probabilities were estimated based on the prior 
conditional probabilities and the analysis of the parent-child relation-
ship between variables in the structural model. For example, in our 
network, the variables perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness,

competitive pressure, Partner readiness are the parents to the variable 
blockchain adoption (child). In this case, the conditional probability for 
the variable blockchain adoption is derived from the discrete values of 
perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, competitive pressure, and 
Partner readiness, i.e., P (Blockchain adoption | Perceived ease of use, 
Perceived usefulness, Competitive pressure, Partner readiness). Similarly, 
the conditional probability for perceived ease of use is estimated as P 
(Perceived ease of use | Training & education, Perceived financial benefits, 
Complexity, Technical know-how). The conditional probabilities for the 
two states (low and high) at the child nodes are shown in table 7 for 
perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and blockchain adoption. 
Bayesian network analysis uses Markov conditions (Hausman and 
Woodward, 1999). The joint probability over all the variables in the 
Bayes network is calculated as; 


P(Z1 = z1, ……, Zn = zn) =
∏n


i=1
P (Zi|Parents(Zi))


As applied to our model, “Z1” is the variable, and “z1” is a state of it 
being “high” or “low.” The right-hand side of the equation represents the 
product of all the conditional probabilities. The term “Parents (Zi)” in 
the equation represents all the parent nodes of the child variable “Zi.” 
Therefore, the joint probability in our model is P(Relative advantage,

cial benefit, Training & education, Technical know-how, Perceived

ness, Blockchain adoption) and is calculated as per the conditional 
probabilities at each node as; P(Relative advantage,…….. blockchain 
adoption) = P(Relative advantage) x P(Top management support) x P 
(Compatibility) x P(Complexity) x P(Perceived financial benefit) x P 
(Training & education) x P(Technical know-how) x P(Competitive 
pressure) x P(Partner readiness) x P(Perceived usefulness |Relative 
advantage, Top management support, Compatibility, Training & edu-
cation) x P(Perceived ease of use |Training & education, Perceived 
financial benefit, Complexity, Technical know-how) x P(blockchain 
adoption | Perceived ease of use, Perceived usefulness, Competitive 
pressure, Partner readiness) The organizations may use this model to 
predict the probability of their blockchain adoption, by assigning the 
probability values in the above equation. The joint probability value 
signifies the blockchain adoption probability, with higher joint proba-
bility value, implying a high likelihood of adopting the blockchain 
technology in the organization. 


5.4. Model evaluation and validation 


GENIE 2.3 software was used to construct the Bayesian network 
analysis with observed prior probabilities. The simulation results with 
prior conditional probabilities (PCP) and revised conditional probabil-
ities (RCP) for the two states (Low and High) of the independent vari-
ables namely; RA: Relative advantage, Top management support, 
Compatibility, Training & Education, Perceived financial benefits, 
Technical know-how, Competitive pressure, Partner readiness were 
calculated. For example, if an organization rates the conditional prob-
ability for Relative advantage (high state) as 0.2 from 0.375 in the 
developed Bayesian network model, we observe that there is no change 
in the posterior conditional probabilities of the dependent variables 
Perceived ease of use and blockchain adoption, with a negligible change 
in the conditional probability of Perceived usefulness (HIGH state) from 
0.58 from 0.61. This signifies that the variable relative advantage is not 
a highly influential variable in the Bayesian network. To obtain more 
profound insights on the influence of the selected variables on the 
blockchain adoption in our Bayesian network, we estimated the influ-
ence of each variable on the dependent variable (blockchain adoption) 
using GENIE 2.3 software. The strength of the influence of all the vari-
ables is shown in Fig. 2. 


The strength of influence values shown in Fig. 2 identifies Compet-
itive pressure (0.420) as the most influential variable that has a signif-
icant effect on the blockchain adoption in the Indian supply chain 
followed by Perceived usefulness (0.358) and Perceived ease of use 
(0.215). The study reveals that Training & education, Perceived ease of 
use, and Relative advantage plays an essential role in developing the 
Perceived usefulness. It is further found that the perceived ease of use is 
an outcome of strong technical know-how on the use of blockchain, the 
complexity of the supply chain, perceived financial benefit, and training 
& education imparted to the employees. 


The developed Bayesian model is based on theoretical structure, 
validated by using SEM. However, we performed necessary validation 
tests on the Bayesian network analysis using GENIE 2.3. The Test only 
method of validation was used to validate the developed model as the 
structural model was based on the theoretical concepts in technology 
adoption literature and not learned from the dataset. The Blockchain 
adoption variable was selected as the predictive variable, resulting in an 
overall accuracy of 88.33%. The highest accuracy of 94.4% was ach-
ieved for predicting the high state of blockchain adoption. The model 
predicted a low state of blockchain adoption with 36%. The Area Under 
Curve- Receiver Operator Characteristics (AUC-ROC) curve for the high 
state of blockchain adoption was plotted to examine the performance of 
the classification model using GENIE 2.3. The AUC-ROC curve shown in 
Fig. 3, shows a satisfactory performance of the developed model. The 
obtained ROC compares satisfactorily against the diagonal line repre-
senting a hypothetical baseline ROC. The same is represented numeri-
cally with the AUC value (0.6166). 


It is learned from our Bayesian network analysis that when the 
probability threshold is p = 0.5, the network achieves a sensitivity of 
0.45 and specificity of 1–0.3157=0.6843. The findings of our study 
reveal that the Bayesian network analysis performs better in predicting 
the high state of blockchain prediction in the supply chains as compared 
to the low state of blockchain prediction. Hence, we recommend that the 
validated Bayesian network model is used for predicting the high 
probability of adopting blockchain in the supply chains. 


6. Discussion and implications 


The study offers practitioners a refined Bayesian structural model 
validated using SEM for predicting the blockchain adoption in supply 
chains. The marginal log-likelihood value obtained for the prediction 
model with the probability of evidence (p(e)) set to high blockchain

adoption was -0.1244, which is highly satisfactory considering the 
number of variables used in the model. The use of the SEM model for 
validating the theoretical model in the context of blockchain adoption in 
an emerging economy such as India has helped in the identification of 
insignificant variables not contributing to the performance of the 
Bayesian network analysis. The findings of the present study imply that 
the use of SEM complements the Bayesian prediction model. It was 
found that the overall prediction accuracy of the Bayesian network 
analysis was 88.33%, and 94.4% for predicting the high state of block-
chain adoption. The Bayesian network analysis identified perceived ease 
of use, perceived usefulness, and competitive pressure as the immediate 
parents (independent variables) influencing the blockchain adoption. 
Previous empirical studies by Kamble et al., (2019), Queiroz and Fosso 
Wamba (2019) support these findings. However, in this study, we have 
also identified the antecedents of perceived usefulness and perceived 
usefulness using the factors from the TOE framework, which has not 
been studied earlier in the literature. 


The dynamic capability theory applied to the adoption of blockchain 
technology emphasizes the importance of developing the required re-
sources and capacity. Adaptation to the changing environment is a dy-
namic capability that refines an organization’s product innovation 
capability and reduces product risk (Pavlou and El Sawy, 2011). 
Adapting organizations have the advantage of being the first mover and, 
thus, remain competitive (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000). There are a lot 
of discrepancies in information and product flows within a complex 
supply chain that affects customer satisfaction and overall efficiency. 
Organizations may not like to lose on this front in the ever-increasing 
competitive market and therefore perceive blockchain to be a strategic 
advantage over its competitors (Haoyan et al., 2017; Kamble et al., 
2019). The importance of competitive pressure as an important influ-
encer to blockchain technology adoption supports the dynamic capa-
bility theory emphasizing that organizations develop new capabilities in 
pursuit of improved competitive position (Carter and Koh, 2018). 


The influence of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness 
implies that organizations who perceive blockchain technology to offer 
increased utility as well as being easy to use, have a high probability of 
adopting blockchain. The probability of high perceived ease of use was 
found to be dependent on the technical know-how of the blockchain, the 
complexity of the supply chain, perceived financial benefit, and the 
regular training and educational programs imparted to employees at 
regular intervals. Technical know-how was found to be a critical factor 
in influencing the perceived ease of use, as India is yet to see successful 


blockchain adoptions within supply chains as compared to more 
developed economies (Queiroz and Fosso Wamba, 2019). Successful 
validations in Indian organizations will provide more exposure to 
implementation managers to improve their implementation skills. The 
complexity of supply chains is perceived to hurt the ease of use. The 
complexity of a supply chain refers to the efficiency that is required to be 
achieved for data integration, blockchain design, and functionality, 
integrating all supply chain partners. Blockchain-enabled global supply 
chains to operate in a complex environment that requires various parties 
to comply with various laws, regulations, and institutions. 


Implementing a blockchain in such a situation is an incredibly 
complex task. It is, therefore, implied that practitioners would develop 
new blockchain applications that will help to integrate highly complex 
supply chains. Practitioners are required to explore the use of blockchain 
as a relationship-building technology focusing on resolving the complex 
and constraining effects of the blockchain (Hald et al., 2019). Min 
(2019) identified that complexities involved in the supply chain trans-
actions lead to issues such as scalability, interoperability, and govern-
ment regulations, leading to practitioners’ perception of blockchain as a 
challenging technology to use. It is therefore implied that the organi-
zations with relatively limited resources or experience in adopting such 
technologies should not underestimate the difficulties associated with 
the implementation of more sophisticated technology, despite the many 
best-practice cases found on technologically sophisticated early 
adopters (Angelis and da Silva, 2019). Training &education help em-
ployees in an organization to understand the technical and functional 
aspects of blockchain technology. A better understanding of the block-
chain technology will make employees more knowledgeable and help 
them to overcome the fear and improve their perceptions on both ease of 
use and usefulness. It is therefore implied that for improvement in the 
probability of perceived ease of use, organizations should develop reli-
able and practical training modules. This will help them to develop a 
highly skilled and talented workforce facilitating the blockchain adop-
tion process. Improved knowledge and expertise will also help organi-
zations to address issues arising due to supply chain and blockchain 
complexities. 


Training & education was also found to influence the perceived 
usefulness of the blockchain. The other influencing factors resulting in a 
high probability of perceived usefulness of blockchain included relative 
advantage offered by blockchain over other technologies, compatibility 
with the existing practices, processes, and technologies, top manage-
ment support, and perceived ease of use. Blockchain, as compared to

other technologies, offers a high relative advantage on the dimensions of 
trust (i.e., reliability and information security) (Collomb and Sok, 2016), 
product safety and authenticity of transactions (Toyoda et al., 2017; 
Mackey and Nayyar, 2017), support in achieving sustainable supply 
chain goals (Saberi et al., 2018), thus enabling supply chain 
re-engineering (Chang et al., 2019). It is, therefore, implied that orga-
nizations with sustainable supply chain goals that are built on trust and 
confidence in transactions have a high probability of implementing 
blockchain. 


Our study finds that the higher the compatibility of the blockchain 
with the existing technological architecture, processes, and practices, 
the higher the probability of increased perceived usefulness. It is 
therefore implied that managers should simplify their business processes 
and develop technical architecture before they move forward in imple-
menting blockchain technology. More efforts will be required in devel-
oping an infrastructure that facilitates the blockchain adoption (Queiroz 
and Fosso Wamba, 2019). Training & education was found to influence 
the perceived usefulness of blockchain technology. The blockchain is a 
significant supply chain transformation process that requires huge 
support from top management. When employees realize the seriousness 
of the top management in implementing blockchain, they are bound to 
develop a perception that it will improve their organizational perfor-
mance (Kamble et al., 2019; Queiroz and Fosso Wamba, 2019; Angelis 
and da Silva, 2019). 


The technical knowledge available with the organization and the 
training and education initiatives to manage blockchain operations are 
essential drivers of perceived usefulness leading to adoption. The finding 
supports that blockchain technology capabilities are continuously 
evolving and follow the three learning mechanisms identified from the 
literature– experience accumulation, knowledge articulation, and 
knowledge codification process (Zollo and Winter, 2002; Becker and 
Huselid, 2006). Employee development, including imparting profes-
sional knowledge and preparing them for future technologies, is an 
essential factor in developing and sustaining individual and organiza-
tional capabilities (Chien and Tsai, 2012; Huang and Intarakumnerd, 
2019). Value cannot be generated by information technology alone and 
must be complemented by human resources (Coltman and Devinney, 
2013; Schuler and Jackson, 1987). The technical readiness through 
active human resource development will help the organization to 
dynamically adapt the rules and routines of the new technology (Teece, 
2007). The perceived financial benefits accrued from blockchain pro-
vides a sense of perceived ease of use influencing the blockchain adop-
tion. Partner readiness is an important predictor of blockchain 
technology adoption and supports the dynamic capabilities theory, 
identifying supplier and customer alliances as opportunities to add 
value, reduce costs and financial risks (Napolitano, 1997; Liao et al., 
2010; Sambasivan et al., 2013). The top management support, which is 
another important dimension of organizational capabilities, is found to 
influence the perceived usefulness of blockchain technology and find 
support in the literature (Liao et al., 2009). 


7. Conclusions and future scope for research 


The existing studies on the blockchain technology adoption in supply 
chains are focused on analyzing the cause and effect relationships using 
behavioral factors such as perceived ease of use and perceived useful-
ness from an individual’s perspective. The literature has identified in the 
past that the institutional factors that include the technological, orga-
nizational, and environmental factors influence technology adoption. 
The present study conceptualized blockchain technology as a dynamic 
capability that every organization should possess to remain competitive 
and analyzed the blockchain adoption behavior of the organizations 
using the theoretical lens of TAM and TOE frameworks. The findings 
support the underlying theory of dynamic capability by identifying 
competitor pressure, partner readiness, perceived usefulness, and 
perceived ease of use as the most influencing factors for blockchain 


adoption. 
The study extends the findings by developing a decision support 


system based on these significant factors. Based on the Bayesian network 
analysis, a machine learning algorithm, the decision support system can 
be used by the decision-makers for predicting the probability of block-
chain adoption in their organization. The use of the Bayesian network 
analysis helps the decision-maker to have a realistic understanding of 
the relationships that are expressed in probabilities. The study reports 
the prior probability values used for developing the Bayesian network, 
which may be used as indicators by the practitioners to predict their 
blockchain adoption probability. The practitioner will be required to 
substitute these probability values (high or low), as applicable to their 
organization to estimate the adoption probability. The Bayesian esti-
mation in the developed model is based on the strength of influence 
between the significant influencing variables and the blockchain adop-
tion. The use of a decision support system will help the decision-makers 
to assess their present adoption probability and develop adoption 
strategies. 


7.1. Future scope for research 


Similar studies in different supply chain contexts will be required to 
be conducted before generalizing the above findings. Other machine 
learning techniques such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and its ex-
tensions may be adopted in similar environments, which are found to 
minimize the noise in the data due to the presence of outliers in training 
set improving the classifier performance (Nie et al., 2017). The findings 
of the present study are based on the perceptions of the supply chain 
practitioners in Indian manufacturing companies from the automobile, 
chemical, and pharmaceutical sectors. In addition, the sample size of 
181 practitioners may be a limitation as it is found that machine learning 
models perform better when the database is extensive. Revised joint 
probabilities may be substituted in the validated model for the inde-
pendent events to refine the model further and improve the learning 
quality. Finally, studies may be conducted on developing self-learning 
models based on different machine learning algorithms instead of 
model development based on theories, then validating the models using 
SEM analysis and testing the consistency of the self-learned model with 
the existing theories in the literature. The findings of such studies will be 
exciting and highly practical from the decision-maker perspectives.
