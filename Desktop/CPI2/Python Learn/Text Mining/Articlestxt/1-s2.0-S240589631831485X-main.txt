Abstract: It is now accepted that using the multi-agents system (MAS) augments the reactivity to treat 


disturbances within flexible manufacturing system. Each agent could have different capability (evolution, 


learning, etc.) and the whole physical and control system, based on the agent interaction, could lead 


emerging behaviors to dynamically adapt a production schedule. Intelligent control algorithms shall be 


used to define these variables and all smart entities within their environment have to continuously 


negotiate for their final common goal. This paper proposes a negotiation-based reactive control approach 


to deal with the variability on manufacturing processes. A simulation experiment on the basis of full 


sized academic experimental platform was used to test how the negotiation-based reactive control 


approach could optimize priority based product sequencing. The product and resource agents have been 


built to negotiate considering different production performance measures. This has been done with 


expectations that the applicability of the negotiation-based reactive decision making process will be more 


adaptable to a production change than myopic decisions.

1. INTRODUCTION 


In today‟s volatile market world, manufacturing industries 


are facing a severe pressure to deal with the increased 


variability of manufacturing systems, especially with the 


control of their lead times, due dates, and work-in-process 


mainly impacted by the queue times. Meanwhile, the 


paradigm of Industry4.0, which gears towards increasingly 


individualized customer requirements (Koch et al. 2014), is 


urging these industries to focus on technological 


advancement by integrating their intelligent resources, 


products, and augmented human. As a result of this pressure, 


industries are continuously seeking for new control systems 


that enable them to respond quickly. For instance, as a 


response to unpredictable disruptions, they could look for 


proactive control (eliminating problems before they have 


chance to appear), reactive control (responding to past or 


current events after they have happened), or interactive 


control (associates with technologies allowing human-


machine interaction) approaches (Fig. 1).  The last approach 


realizes the capability of smart entities to create a system 


such that production components within the system not only 


interact to each other but also adapt and/or learn.  


In addition to manufacturing industries, research institutions 


have been also showed the interest of designing and 


employing negotiation heuristics for multi-agent 


manufacturing systems (Shen et al. 2006). For example, when 


schedules acquire a reputation for rapid invalidity because of 


frequent changes, using dynamic rescheduling methods to 


conquer such disturbances is proved to be crucial. To do this, 


intelligent optimization protocols shall be used to define 


different variables and all entities within the environment 


have to continuously negotiate for final decision. In this 


paper, negotiation-based reactive control approach (NRC) 


between product and resource agents cooperating to set best 


sequential priority-based production process has been 


presented to show its advantage over pure reactive control 


approach (PRC). In pure reactive control approach, product 


agents are active and well known of their own state but 


resource agents are mostly dormant that simply waits for 


instructions from product agents and hence the overall 


performance of the system is decided by product agents only.

MATLAB simulation experiments on the basis of 


TRACILOGIS test-bed platform was used to test how these 


two production decision approaches affect the priority based 


routing sheet. Resource utilization, product tardiness, and 


makespan as performance measures and work-in-process 


queue between a machine and its upper stream as constraint 


are considered during the experiment. The work proposed in 


this paper is 


the continuity of Mezgebe et al. (2018). The experimental 


scenario is significantly improved with a greater 


analysis of performance criteria on higher instances. The test 


on the TRACILOGIS Platform is still in progress. 


The rest of the paper is organized as follow. Section 2 


elaborates related works on negotiation-based reactive 


control approach. After this, Section 3 demonstrates the 


negotiation scenario between product and resource agents 


using different control protocols and mathematical models. 


Section 4 analyses the comparative results of the two control 


approaches. Finally, Section 5 forwards further remarks 


mainly relating to the role of consensus algorithm for 


optimizing distributed reactive control by coupling with 


central entities. 


2. REVIEW OF RELATED MATERIALS 


In the manufacturing control systems survey, it is well 


accepted that multi-agents system model is a good way to 


deal with disturbances observed within a shop floor. Without 


being exhaustive, some intelligent manufacturing control 


systems based on MAS could be cited: Leitão (2009), Herrera 


et al. (2016), Saharidis et al. (2006), Anderson & Bartholdi 


(2000), Mezgebe et al. (2018) etc. Successively, many 


researchers are still working on this control system as it 


employs different models depending on the nature of real 


time events. Multi-agent system (MAS) is a system that 


consist a society of agents that could potentially collaborate 


with each other with capability to perceive, reason, and 


communicate to solve problems (Wooldridge, 2009; Botti & 


Giret, 2008; Isern et al., 2011). Wooldridge (2009) has raised 


two questions that could always come when one needs to 


implement these cooperative agents: (a) How one can build 


agents that are capable of autonomy? (b) How one can build 


agents that are capable of cooperating with other agents?  


In answering these questions, an agent has to cooperate with 


other nearby agents in several different ways. Validating this 


cooperation, Isern et al. (2011) has presented that even 


though agents are perceived as autonomous entities, they are 


also members of a society and have to exchange information 


with other agents and maintain some relationships at an 


organizational level. Consequently, the mere presence of 


multiple agents makes the environment appear dynamic from 


the point of view of each agent, with the control system they 


follow, typically distributed reactive control (Vlassis 2003). 


On the other hand, to create an environment that provides an 


infrastructure specifying communication and interaction 


protocols of agents, Weiss (1999) has pointed out the 


knowability, reactivity, and sociability of agents as basic 


characteristics of multi-agent environment. Meanwhile, 


Holvoet & Valckenaers (2006) have stated that the 


applicability of MAS is characterized by their large scale in 


terms of number of agents & physical distribution, their very 


dynamic nature, and their complex functional & non-


functional requirements. To sustain these characteristics, 


different application models and control architectures could 


always take appropriate attention as they bring amplified 


benefits. Examples are ant colony (Valckenaers & Van 


Brussel, 2015; Blum & Sampels, 2004; Liang & Smith, 2004; 


termite colony (Pannequin R. & Thomas A. (2012), potential 


field (Pach et al., 2014), and negotiation between intelligent 


entities (Tonino, 2002; Rahwan et al., 2003; Kraus, 1997), 


among many others. 


From these applicability models, the negotiation of agents 


has taken viable attention. For instance, Dimopoulos & 


Moraitis (2006) has stated that individual agents can generate 


and execute their plans independently. However, as they 


operate in the same environment, conflicts may arise and 


hence they need to coordinate their course of action. 


(Zambrano et al., 2011; Wooldridge, 2009) have also 


indicated that negotiation among agents is foreseen to host a 


robust-predictive-reactive scheduling and also to tackle 


myopia. On the other hand, Tonino et al. (2002) has 


illustrated the investigations of different automated agent 


negotiation approaches including game-theoretic, heuristic-


based, and argumentation-based approaches. Globally, three 


of them emphasize the importance of exchanging information 


between agents in order to mutually influence their 


behaviours. The game-theoretic approach helps to determine 


an optimal strategy by analyzing the interaction of agents as a 


game rule between identical and self-interested participants 


(Nagarajan & Sošić, 2008; Rosenschein & Zlotkin, 1994) but 


unbounded computational resources as limitation. To 


overcome this limitation, the heuristic approach has come 


with the principle of “produce good enough rather than 


optimal outcomes” (Aydogan et al., 2013; Kraus, 2001). 


Irrespective of its advantage, this approach is also known for 


its sub-optimal outcome as it does not examine the full space 


of possible outcomes (Jennings et al. 2001). 


Argumentation-based negotiation approach has evolved to 


overcome the knowledge limitations of agents in game-


theoretic and heuristic negotiation approaches. As it has been 


surveyed by Rahwan et al. (2003), this negotiation approach 
allows agents to exchange additional information, or to argue 


about their beliefs & other‟s mental attitudes during the 


negotiation process. Agents accept, reject, or critique an offer 


proposed by other agent until they agree on this offer. 


Generally, the work of Rahwan et al. (2003) has magnified 


that argumentation-based negotiation approach has been 


gained increasing popularity for its potential ability to 


overcome the limitations of other conventional approaches. 


However, too little attention has been paid to the role of 


smart agents in improving the performance of negotiation 


approaches. Consequently, as it is stated earlier, Mezgebe et 


al. (2018) have proposed negotiation model considering 


smart product agents scheduled to be processed on two 


resource agents. The communication protocol was fully 


controlled by these product agents and the role of RFID 


technology was partly used to help detect disturbances and 


send back to product agents for its management. As

continuation of this work, this paper has considered a full 


sized academic experimental platform configured with four 


executing resource agents and many real time events that 


demand more dynamic decisions; zone B of (Fig. 2). Product 


& resource agents are made to broadcast information among 


each other with complete involvement of RFID technology 


and PLC technology. Meanwhile, the experimental 


simulation scenario has been significantly improved with a 


greater analysis of performance criteria on higher instances.  


3. THE NEGOTIATION-BASED REACTIVE 
CONTROL SCENARIO 


As it has been emphasized in (Fig. 1), if unexpected system 


disturbance that has significant impact on a master 


production schedule (MPS) has occurred, heuristic 


rescheduling is expected right after the interruption to save 


the master schedule. The big concern at this juncture is how 


to make all control agents to define best decision in order to 


behave in a sense that the whole system stays globally 


sufficient for its immediate goal. To simulate this decision, a 


physical system of carpentry factory with four chronological 


work activities namely cutting (resizing), drilling, sanding, 


and coating is modeled based on the TRACILOGIS platform 


shown in (Fig. 2). The modeled physical system is composed 


of four intelligent machines M1, M2, M3, and M4 to execute 


these operations. In case of unpredictable failure of one 


machine, others have the capability to perform all operations. 


3.1 The TRACILOGIS platform 


TRACILOGIS test-bed platform lets studying different types 


of identification, traceability, and control (either centralized, 


distributed, or hybrid of the two) for products & logistic 


chains in wood industry. It is composed of an extensive 


system of networks, linking different actors of the system, be 


they sensors, actuators to automata or even automata to 


computers, RFID (Radio Frequency IDentification) sensors, 


PLC (Production Line Controller agents that manage all of 


the automaton actions of their area) etc. Additionally, it 


allows to assess the impact of new & smart technologies, test 


& demonstrate new production decision modes, and confirm 


running modes for production control through its four 


automations; Zone-A to Zone-D in (Fig. 2).  


3.2 Simulated configuration of the physical system  


Three product types from three customer orders Order-1, 


Order-2, and Order-3 are considered to be executed on the 


system at full batch horizon and for each order; ten intelligent 


products (Pi) are launched on the platform. Each product 


agent follows the standard routing sheet based on the MPS 


given in Error! Reference source not found.. Products are 


made to enter the system based on their sequential order; 


order-1 enters first and order-2 & order-3 follows but Order-3 


succeeds order-1 at the exit of the system as the production 


decision has used SPT dispatching rule during the production 


process. In the MPS based routing sheet shown in Table 1 


and (Fig. 2), products in order-3, for example, passes on M1 


for their first operation (O1), moves to M2 for their next 


operation (O2), loops on buffer stoke zone until the products 


of order-1 completes their processing time in M3, travels to 


M3 for their third operation (O3), and finally routes to M4 for 


their fourth operation (O4).  


While following this route, if products expect to route 


without their optimal operational sequence due to many 


reasons (e.g., when unfortunate work-in-process pile-up

high resource setup time, tardiness, and other subsequent 


problems. Hence, the work-in-process piled-up routing sheet 


is made to pursue negotiation-based reactive decision. 


Simulation with MATLAB is performed in order to compare 


this negotiation-based approach with pure reactive control 


approach and to pinpoint the best priority based product 


sequencing. Accordingly, all agents have been cooperated by 


computing and analyzing intention of products, step-1 in 


(Fig. 3). The intention of each product „i‟ is to arrive and 


process in each machine „m‟ and each product compute (step-


2 in (Fig. 3)) its intention and broadcast to machine that it is 


approaching based on its arrival, process, and release times,

MATLAB simulation experiments on the basis of 


TRACILOGIS test-bed platform was used to test how these 


two production decision approaches affect the priority based 


routing sheet. Resource utilization, product tardiness, and 


makespan as performance measures and work-in-process 


queue between a machine and its upper stream as constraint 


are considered during the experiment. The work proposed in 


this paper is 


the continuity of Mezgebe et al. (2018). The experimental 


scenario is significantly improved with a greater 


analysis of performance criteria on higher instances. The test 


on the TRACILOGIS Platform is still in progress. 


The rest of the paper is organized as follow. Section 2 


elaborates related works on negotiation-based reactive 


control approach. After this, Section 3 demonstrates the 


negotiation scenario between product and resource agents 


using different control protocols and mathematical models. 


Section 4 analyses the comparative results of the two control 


approaches. Finally, Section 5 forwards further remarks 


mainly relating to the role of consensus algorithm for 


optimizing distributed reactive control by coupling with 


central entities. 


2. REVIEW OF RELATED MATERIALS 


In the manufacturing control systems survey, it is well 


accepted that multi-agents system model is a good way to 


deal with disturbances observed within a shop floor. Without 


being exhaustive, some intelligent manufacturing control 


systems based on MAS could be cited: Leitão (2009), Herrera 


et al. (2016), Saharidis et al. (2006), Anderson & Bartholdi 


(2000), Mezgebe et al. (2018) etc. Successively, many 


researchers are still working on this control system as it 


employs different models depending on the nature of real 


time events. Multi-agent system (MAS) is a system that 


consist a society of agents that could potentially collaborate 


with each other with capability to perceive, reason, and 


communicate to solve problems (Wooldridge, 2009; Botti & 


Giret, 2008; Isern et al., 2011). Wooldridge (2009) has raised 


two questions that could always come when one needs to 


implement these cooperative agents: (a) How one can build 


agents that are capable of autonomy? (b) How one can build 


agents that are capable of cooperating with other agents?  


In answering these questions, an agent has to cooperate with 


other nearby agents in several different ways. Validating this 


cooperation, Isern et al. (2011) has presented that even 


though agents are perceived as autonomous entities, they are 


also members of a society and have to exchange information 


with other agents and maintain some relationships at an 


organizational level. Consequently, the mere presence of 


multiple agents makes the environment appear dynamic from 


the point of view of each agent, with the control system they 


follow, typically distributed reactive control (Vlassis 2003). 


On the other hand, to create an environment that provides an 


infrastructure specifying communication and interaction 


protocols of agents, Weiss (1999) has pointed out the 


knowability, reactivity, and sociability of agents as basic 


characteristics of multi-agent environment. Meanwhile, 


Holvoet & Valckenaers (2006) have stated that the 


applicability of MAS is characterized by their large scale in 


terms of number of agents & physical distribution, their very 


dynamic nature, and their complex functional & non-


functional requirements. To sustain these characteristics, 


different application models and control architectures could 


always take appropriate attention as they bring amplified 


benefits. Examples are ant colony (Valckenaers & Van 


Brussel, 2015; Blum & Sampels, 2004; Liang & Smith, 2004; 


termite colony (Pannequin R. & Thomas A. (2012), potential 


field (Pach et al., 2014), and negotiation between intelligent 


entities (Tonino, 2002; Rahwan et al., 2003; Kraus, 1997), 


among many others. 


From these applicability models, the negotiation of agents 


has taken viable attention. For instance, Dimopoulos & 


Moraitis (2006) has stated that individual agents can generate 


and execute their plans independently. However, as they 


operate in the same environment, conflicts may arise and 


hence they need to coordinate their course of action. 


(Zambrano et al., 2011; Wooldridge, 2009) have also 


indicated that negotiation among agents is foreseen to host a 


robust-predictive-reactive scheduling and also to tackle 


myopia. On the other hand, Tonino et al. (2002) has 


illustrated the investigations of different automated agent 


negotiation approaches including game-theoretic, heuristic-


based, and argumentation-based approaches. Globally, three 


of them emphasize the importance of exchanging information 


between agents in order to mutually influence their 


behaviours. The game-theoretic approach helps to determine 


an optimal strategy by analyzing the interaction of agents as a 


game rule between identical and self-interested participants 


(Nagarajan & Sošić, 2008; Rosenschein & Zlotkin, 1994) but 


unbounded computational resources as limitation. To 


overcome this limitation, the heuristic approach has come 


with the principle of “produce good enough rather than 


optimal outcomes” (Aydogan et al., 2013; Kraus, 2001). 


Irrespective of its advantage, this approach is also known for 


its sub-optimal outcome as it does not examine the full space 


of possible outcomes (Jennings et al. 2001). 


Argumentation-based negotiation approach has evolved to 


overcome the knowledge limitations of agents in game-


theoretic and heuristic negotiation approaches. As it has been 


surveyed by Rahwan et al. (2003), this negotiation approach 
allows agents to exchange additional information, or to argue 


about their beliefs & other‟s mental attitudes during the 


negotiation process. Agents accept, reject, or critique an offer 


proposed by other agent until they agree on this offer. 


Generally, the work of Rahwan et al. (2003) has magnified 


that argumentation-based negotiation approach has been 


gained increasing popularity for its potential ability to 


overcome the limitations of other conventional approaches. 


However, too little attention has been paid to the role of 


smart agents in improving the performance of negotiation 


approaches. Consequently, as it is stated earlier, Mezgebe et 


al. (2018) have proposed negotiation model considering 


smart product agents scheduled to be processed on two 


resource agents. The communication protocol was fully 


controlled by these product agents and the role of RFID 


technology was partly used to help detect disturbances and 


send back to product agents for its management. As

Once the utilization rate has been determined, products 


should keep their due date by computing their makespan and 


tardiness in order to complete their route before the due date. 


Thus, products calculate their makespan and tardiness from

the transportation time of product ‟i‟ to next machine „m‟, Xim 


is the mean of product completion time, Li is product 


lateness, and Tardi is product tardiness 


To maximize utilisability, to minimize input buffer, and to 


minimize queuing time of remaining operations, resource 


agents request each product to arrive based on their critical 


ratio order with an intention to process a product with least 


critical ratio first. This makes the machine agents to 


understand whether product „i‟ is approaching tardy or not. 


Hence, each resource agent has to calculate the critical ratio 


(CRi) of product „i‟ based on the model shown in “(5)”. In 


“(5)” total routing sheet time remaining is the setup, 


processing, transportation, and expected queuing times of all 


remaining operations.

th


 products, in turn, evaluate the 


intention set by product „i‟ and they will accept if it doesn‟t 


affect their predetermined critical ratio or ask product „i‟ to 


revisit its intention, step-4 in (Fig. 3). For example, when the 


last product of order-2 and first product of order-1 meets in 


decision point „2‟ of (Fig. 2), the intention of product of 


order-2 is to succeed product of order-1 as the due date of 


product of order-2 is less than that of product of order-1. If 


not, product of order-1 will have to route a loop in the buffer 


zone until product of order-2 directly passes to M3. This in 


turn, could delay the routing and completion time of products 


of order-3. Finally, products prioritization has to be validated 


by resources through recalculating their utilization rate for 


every acceptance of intention of products, step-4 of (Fig. 4).  


4. ANALYSIS & MANIPULATION OF 
SIMULATION EXPERIMENTS 


Two hundred MATLAB simulation runs have been executed 


for each control approaches. The pure reactive control 


approach was simulated considering the “change the product 


intention” routing principle such that products only have a 


little information about other‟s state, resource status, and 


routing. While products do not allow sending their correct 


intention, resources become inefficient and are led to high 


setup time when the products are tardy and hence the global 


makespan increases linearly. After this, the negotiation-based 


reactive control approach is simulated with “update the 


product intention and routing” principle. To compare the 


significance of these two control approaches, three 


performance measures were used and presented as follow. 


The simulation results considering the product lateness (or 


tardiness) is illustrated in the upper part of (Fig. 4). In the 


negotiation-based control approach, agents have able to 


reduce the lateness to a minimum of 10,019 unit times in one 


of their simulation run but in pure reactive control approach, 


the minimum lateness has recorded to be 23,021 unit times. 


This shows that the product lateness in the routing sheet has 


reduced, on average, by 30.5% as a result of the environment 


created for the former approach. Following the minimization 


of product lateness, the utilization rate of resource (M1) has 


also improved; lower part of (Fig. 4). On average, capacity of 


M1 and M2 is utilized 11.3% and 10.3% respectively better 


than the pure reactive control approach. On the other hand 


(Fig. 5) presents that in pure reactive control approach, once 


product agent has set its sequential route, it almost continue 


to follow this route instead of setting another optimal route 


that helps him minimize its makespan. But in the case of 


negotiation-based control approach, product agent updates its 


preset route to all other agents to help minimize its makespan. 


The maximum makespan during the former approach is 


exposed to be 5,022 unit times but it is reduced to 4,851 unit 


times following the pursuance of the second approach. This

predicates that the makespan is minimized by 3.4% after 


employing the second approach.

Fig. 5. The makespan analysis in both control approaches 





Fig. 6. Makespan versus resource utilization (M1) in PRC   





Fig. 7. Makespan versus resource utilization (M1) in NRC  


The simulation experiment has also compared two 


performance indicators to each other. For instance, as shown 


in (Fig. 6), while the resource utilization rate increases, the 


makespan also increases gradually. Though the machine is 


busy in processing the operations of predecessor products, it 


could not be able to minimize the makespan as successor 


products reach the resource without understanding its status. 


Hence, the successor products are obligated to wait close to 


the resource (excess buffer) until their processing time start 


on the resource. (Fig. 7) has reversed this tendency; the 


makespan values are shifting downward when the resource 


utilization increases. Statistically, (Fig. 6) illustrates that all 


the makespan values are closer to the fitted regression line by 


1.3% (the squared or coefficient of determination, „R-Sq‟) 


but in (Fig. 7), the makespan values are closer to the 


coefficient of regression line by 3.5%. This shows that after 


employing the negotiation-based control approach, all the 


makespan values are positioned around the regression line 


and consequently the routing sheet has optimized by 52.09% 


than following the pure reactive control approach. To recap 


the analysis, three of the performance indicators have shown 


significant advantage of negotiation based control approach 


in increasing adaptability and flexibility of decision entities 


within a disturbed industrial environment. 


5. CONCLUSION AND FURTHER REMARK 


This paper has presented that the role of negotiation based 


multi-agents system is increasing in supporting decision 


making capability of manufacturing entities. For instance, the 


simulated scenario has improved the routing sheet by 


minimizing the makespan by 3.4% over the pure reactive 


control approach. However, it has left to fully enrich the 


system as agents might decide alone while they are on their 


route. Thus, to enhance the validated results, a consensus-


based distributed control system has to be explored with an 


objective to make agents to converge towards a predefined 


intention. For example, the maximum resource utilization rate 


obtained using the negotiation model was 68.2%. Why not 


more than this? To bring such advancement, agents have to 


continuously negotiate before they start an execution and 


converge to a common offer. And the design and 


development of this algorithm will be the continuous work of 


this paper.
