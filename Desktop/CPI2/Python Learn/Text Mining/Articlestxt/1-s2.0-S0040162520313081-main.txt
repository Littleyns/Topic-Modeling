Artificial intelligence (AI) may be one of the most disruptive technologies of the 21st century, with the potential 
to transform every aspect of society. Preparing for a “good AI society” has become a hot topic, with growing 
public and scientific interest in the principles, policies, incentives, and ethical frameworks necessary for society 
to enjoy the benefits of AI while minimizing the risks associated with its use. However, despite the renewed 
interest in artificial intelligence, little is known of the direction in which AI scholarship is moving and whether 
the field is evolving towards the goal of building a “good AI society”. Based on a bibliometric analysis of 40147 
documents retrieved from the Web of Science database, this study describes the intellectual, social, and con-
ceptual structure of AI research. It provides 136 evidence-based research questions about how AI research can 
help understand the social changes brought about by AI and prepare for a “good AI society.” The research agenda 
is organized according to ten social impact domains identified from the literature, including crisis response, 
economic empowerment, educational challenges, environmental challenges, equality and inclusion, health and 
hunger, information verification and validation, infrastructure management, public and social sector manage-
ment, security, and justice.   


1. Introduction 


Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming every aspect of 
society. Advances in neuroscience, nanotechnologies, computer science, 
cognitive psychology, and AI-related technologies have renewed interest 
among both AI scholars and practitioners. Not surprisingly, preparing 
for a “good AI society” has become a hot topic (Berendt, 2019; Cath 
et al., 2018; Floridi and Cowls, 2019; Floridi et al., 2018), with growing 
public and scientific interest in the principles, policies, incentives and 
ethical frameworks that can help society enjoy the benefits and oppor-
tunities created by AI while minimizing the risks associated with its 
adoption and use. 


Today, artificial intelligence is changing the way people interact 
with technology, assisting users in the execution of both simple and 
complex tasks (Luger and Sellen, 2016; Pradhan et al., 2018; Schuetz 
and Venkatesh, 2020), improving business operations, products, and 
customer services (Davenport and Ronanki, 2018; Roßmann et al., 
2018), healthcare services (Szolovits, 2019), transportation 


(Abduljabbar et al., 2019), disaster prediction and management (Foto-
vatikhah et al., 2018), agriculture (Jha et al., 2019), and smart cities 
(Allam and Dhunny, 2019). Artificial intelligence is increasingly seen as 
an opportunity to address complex societal problems such as sustain-
ability (Nishant et al., 2020) and the COVID-19 pandemic (Sipior, 2020). 
Current and future developments in artificial intelligence technologies 
are expected to positively impact both business and society for years to 
come (Betz et al., 2019; Montes and Goertzel, 2019). 


The rapid development of the field has led some scholars to argue 
that “human-level artificial intelligence” could be achieved within the 
next half-century (Baum et al., 2011, p. 186), that AI may surpass 
average human thinking (Simon, 2019), and that we may see the fusion 
of artificial and human intelligence in the not so distant future (Montes 
and Goertzel, 2019). Other scholars have expressed concern over how 
quickly AI is outperforming humans in most tasks (Grace et al., 2018) 
and an increasing willingness to delegate tasks to AI systems (Taddeo 
and Floridi, 2018). Several influential politicians, entrepreneurs, and 
scientists have even warned that AI represents an existential threat to

mankind (Barrat, 2013). Indeed, eminent scientists such as the late 
Professor Stephen Hawking have expressed fear that the creation of 
machines that match or surpass humans could end mankind (Cellan--
Jones, 2014). 


The challenge for society and organizations is to determine how best 
to harness AI technologies for good while avoiding its dangers and pit-
falls (Makridakis, 2017). Parallel to technological advances, AI research 
should also consider its economic impacts, legal frameworks, and 
questions of ethics, transparency, accountability, fairness, and safety 
(Cath et al., 2018; Russell et al., 2015b). However, despite the renewed 
scholarly interest in artificial intelligence, little is known of the direction 
in which AI research is moving. 


This study’s overarching objective is to evaluate past and current ‘AI 
for social good’ scholarship through bibliometric methods and provide 
guidance for future research efforts into this specific field. Our work 
follows two stages: Firstly, we review the evolution and structure of 
overall AI research using bibliometric methods to generate insights into 
the conceptual, intellectual, and social structure of AI scholarship; 
Secondly, we narrow our focus to the review of the ‘AI for social good’ 
literature and provide evidence-based research directions to expand our 
knowledge of how AI can benefit society. 


We use bibliometric techniques to examine the conceptual, intel-
lectual, and social structure of AI scholarship. Our study complements 
earlier overviews of AI research (Dwivedi et al., 2019; Frank et al., 2019; 
Niu et al., 2016) by covering a wider scope of academic sources and 
taking into account publications up to and including 2019. Most 
importantly, our work focuses on how well AI research is developing 
themes necessary to move towards a “good AI society” and in so doing 
identifies areas requiring more research. 


The first section of the paper presents and defines artificial intelli-
gence and identifies the domains where AI can be used for social good. 
The second section presents the methods used to collect and analyze the 
AI literature. The current state of the literature is then described, 
including an analysis of influential works, authors, institutions, and 
current research patterns and collaborations. The following section 
considers the evolution of sub-fields where AI could have a positive 
social impact. The paper concludes with a discussion of avenues for 
future research. 


2. What is artificial intelligence 


2.1. A definition of AI 


The field of artificial intelligence (AI) strives to understand and build 
intelligent entities (Russell and Norvig, 2010). In this paper, we define 
artificial intelligence (AI) as “machines or computer systems capable of 
learning to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence” 
(Bawack et al., 2019). In the last five years, AI research and practices 
have been transformed by advances in AI algorithms, big data, and cloud 
computing (Borges et al., 2020), and today’s AI systems are expected to 
“correctly interpret external data, to learn from such data, and to use 
those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible 
adaptation” (Kaplan and Haenlein, 2019, p. 15). 


Generally speaking, there are two forms of AI: “Strong AI” and “Weak 
AI” (Kaplan and Haenlein, 2020; Searle, 1980). Strong AI refers to that 
which can behave in a way that equals or surpasses human intelligence, 
while weak AI is that which simulates human intelligence in specific 
problem domains. The latter is the most commonly used form of AI in the 
world today, and generally, when people discuss AI technologies, they 
are referring to weak AI. Every AI is expected to have four main capa-
bilities: the ability to perceive, the ability to comprehend, the ability to 
act, and the ability to learn. These capabilities are enabled by technol-
ogies such as sensors and AI techniques, including natural language 
processing, computer vision, image recognition, machine learning, and 
deep learning (Bawack et al., 2019; Duan et al., 2019). 


2.2. A short history of AI 


The AI research field started as a two-month, 10-man research 
project at Dartmouth College in 1956 “to make machines use language, 
form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved 
for humans, and improve themselves” (McCarthy et al. 2006, pg. 2). 
Early application of AI took the form of expert systems (ES) and decision 
support systems (DSS) (Gill, 1995; Remus and Kottemann, 1986). Ad-
vances in supercomputing and big data technologies over the past 
decade have provided AI systems with the ability to perform more 
complex tasks than traditional DSS and ES. Today, some AI applications 
can perceive, reason, learn, interact, solve problems, make decisions, 
and create, allowing them to substitute, augment, or complement 
humans in task execution (Duan et al., 2019; Rai et al., 2019). 


Haenlein and Kaplan (2019) describe how the AI field has evolved 
using an analogy of the four seasons: spring, summer, fall, and winter. 
According to the authors, the AI Spring begins with the publication by 
Isaac Asimov of a short story on robotics and includes the development 
by Alan Turing of an electro-mechanical computer capable of breaking 
encrypted German messages during the Second world war, and the 
Turing Test that is still used today to determine whether a machine is 
intelligent or not. The AI Summer starts in 1956 with the Dartmouth 
Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence followed by two 
decades of significant advances in AI technologies and theories. In 1973, 
the US Congress began criticizing the level of spending on AI research, 
and the British Science Research Council questioned the optimistic 
forecasts of AI researchers. Consequently, public funding for AI research 
by the US and British governments was significantly cut, and the AI field 
entered a 41 yearlong winter from 1973 to 2014. The success of Google’s 
Alpha Go in 2015 based on advances in artificial neural networks and 
deep learning heralded the start of the period of AI Fall (or AI Harvest), 
as the field began to harvest “the fruits of past statistical advances” (p.8). 
We will use this periodization of AI, illustrated in Fig. 1 to examine the 
evolution of the field. 


2.3. The state of AI scholarship 


One of the first reviews of AI scholarship was undertaken by Rajaram 
(1990) where he summarized technological advances in the field using a 
taxonomy of AI systems. Other studies have reviewed the AI field since, 
but most have focused on specific domains and/or AI techniques. For 
example, Zakhem et al. (2020) conducted a systematic literature review 
on the use and evolution of AI for skin cancer assessment. Fernande-
z-Luque and Imran (2018) conducted a narrative literature review on 
the different applications and challenges of AI in humanitarian health 
crises. Islam et al. (2020) reviewed AI techniques used to solve drilling 
problems in the oil and gas industry. McKinnel et al. (2019) conducted a 
systematic review and meta-analysis of the AI literature to identify 
research challenges and opportunities related to penetration testing and 
system vulnerability assessment. Kumar (2017) reviewed the scholar-
ship of AI use in process planning and manufacturing. Similar reviews of 
AI research have also been conducted for the media industry (Cha-
n-Olmsted, 2019), service delivery (Gursoy et al., 2019), operations 
management (Grover et al., 2020), accounting (Moudud-Ul-Huq, 2014), 
the public sector (de Sousa, de Melo, Bermejo, Farias, and Gomes, 2019), 
marketing (Davenport et al., 2020), employment and work (Wang and 
Siau, 2019), resulting in the development of several industry or 
sector-specific research agendas. 


Few studies provide a holistic view of AI scholarship. The most 
comprehensive AI research study was a bibliometric analysis of research 
published between 1990 and 2014 conducted by Niu et al. (2016). Since 
then, other studies have been domain-specific, including the use of AI for 
innovation management (Häfner et al., 2020), engineering (Shukla 
et al., 2019), national security (Wamba et al., 2019), and health and 
medicine (Tran et al., 2019). Each of these reviews focused on 
domain-specific AI applications, and only one study by Wang and Siau

(2019) proposed a research agenda to explore the social implications of 
AI, with a particular focus on the future of work. Our study addresses 
this research gap by conducting a bibliometric analysis of four decades 
of AI literature and by using the results to identify future research di-
rections and formulate questions that focus on developing AI for social 
good. 


2.4. Artificial intelligence for social good 


Until the mid-2000s, AI research had productively pursued a 
research agenda that “focused largely on techniques that are neutral 
with respect to purpose” (Russell et al., 2015b, p. 3). Faced with the 
rapidly improving performance of AI, an increase in possible application 
areas and a “focus of attention, expectation, and concern growing 
among the general population” (Horvitz and Selman, 2009, p. 5) for AI 
outcomes and impacts, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial 
Intelligence (AAAI) brought together a panel of AI scholars “to explore 
and reflect about societal aspects of advances in machine intelligence 
(computational procedures for automated sensing, learning, reasoning, 
and decision making)” (Horvitz and Selman, 2009, p. 1). While social 
issues concerning robotics (Asimov, 1942; Weld and Etzioni, 1994), 
algorithms (Mittelstadt et al., 2016) and other artificial intelligence 
techniques had previously been raised in the literature, the AAAI report 
created debate in and beyond the AI field and was the first structured 
attempt at identifying the potential social risks and impacts of AI 
research and applications. 


The work of the AAAI panel led to the launch of the “One Hundred 
Year Study on Artificial Intelligence” in 2014 by Stanford University to 
investigate the influence of AI on people and society (Horvitz, 2014). 
The group’s first report in 2016 identified eight sectors or domains 
where AI could have a distinct impact on society, including trans-
portation, home/service robotics, healthcare, education, low-resource 
communities, public safety and security, employment and workplace, 
and entertainment (Stone et al., 2016). 


Concurrently, in an open letter to AI Magazine in 2015, over 7000 
researchers launched a call for a research agenda to build more “robust 
and beneficial artificial intelligence” (Russell et al., 2015b, p. 3), and an 
accompanying paper identified several research directions to “help 
maximize the societal benefit of AI”, including AI’s economic impact, 
legal and ethical issues, and technical studies to develop more robust AI 
systems (Russell et al., 2015a, p. 106). 


In 2016, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, 
the European Parliament’s Committee on Legal Affairs, and the UK’s 
House of Commons’ Science and Technology Committee each released a 
report on the social and policy implications of artificial intelligence, 
machine learning, algorithms, and robotics. The reports each described 
a “good AI society” with similar key values of “transparency, 


accountability, and a ‘positive impact’ on the economy and society” 
(Cath et al., 2018, p.532). 


More recently, the McKinsey Global Institute examined 160 AI use 
cases and identified ten domains where AI technologies could have a 
large-scale social impact (Chui et al., 2018). The domains cover the 
seventeen United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)1 and 
include crisis response, economic empowerment, educational chal-
lenges, environmental challenges, equality and inclusion, health and 
hunger, information verification and validation, infrastructure man-
agement, public and social sector management, and security and justice. 
The study by Chui et al. (2018) is the most complete and recent review of 
potential areas of AI for social impact and will be used as a framework to 
describe the state of research in AI for good in Section 4 and to identify 
opportunities for future research in AI for good in Section 5. The ten 
social impact domains are presented in Appendix 1. 


3. Methodology 


3.1. Search strategy 


The most relevant documents were extracted from the Web of Sci-
ence (WoS) database using specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. WoS 
is widely recognized as a reliable academic database for bibliometric 
research as it contains a large number of high-profile and high-quality 
international academic publications (Batistič and der Laken, 2019; 
Zhang et al., 2019), it offers robust metadata suitable for bibliometric 
analyses (Gaviria-Marin et al., 2019) and it covers a longer period than 
alternative databases with equivalent domain coverage such as Scopus 
or Google Scholar (Harzing and Alakangas, 2016). All document types 
available in the WoS Core Collection were used for the analysis. 


A total of 40 147 unique documents in English were retrieved using 
the search term “artificial intelligence”2 covering a forty-four-year 
period from 1975 to 2019. Table 1 presents the summary statistics for 
the corpus. 


A total of 83 346 authors contributed to the literature between 1975 
and 2019. The documents were mainly co-written, with multi-authored 
documents representing 80% of the corpus. The earliest publication in 
the corpus was a paper by Jerry Felsen of the University of Southwestern 
Louisiana entitled “Artificial intelligence techniques applied to reduc-
tion of uncertainty in decision analysis through learning” published in 
Operational Research Quarterly3 in 1975.

The five-year period of AI Fall saw strong growth in per year publi-
cations, a larger number of authors, and more collaborations than dur-
ing the 40-year AI Winter. The collaboration index (i.e., total authors of 
multi-authored documents divided by total multi-authored documents) 
increased from 2.22 to 2.97, signaling that a greater number of authors 
were collaborating on multi-author documents during the later period. 
Remarkably, the number of publications is almost identical across these 
two unequal time frames.. 


3.2. Method of analysis 


We used bibliometric techniques to analyze the development and 
evolution of the AI research field. In the social sciences and management 
research, bibliometrics has been extensively used to study the evolution 
of research in areas including big data (Batistič and der Laken, 2019; 
Zhang et al., 2019), robotics (Goeldner et al., 2015), the internet of 
things (Nobre and Tavares, 2017), knowledge management (Gavir-
ia-Marin et al., 2019), supply chain management (Fahimnia et al., 2015; 
Mishra et al., 2016), technological innovation (van Oorschot, Hofman, 
and Halman, 2018) and social entrepreneurship (Rey-Martí et al., 2016). 


The two main categories of bibliometric procedures available are 
performance analysis and science mapping (Noyons et al., 1999). Per-
formance analysis involves evaluating the production and impact of 
groups of scientific actors, most often authors, institutions, countries, 
and journals using bibliographic data. Science mapping is used to 
represent and analyze the current and evolving cognitive and social 
structures of a research field. The Bibliomerix4 R package was used to 
calculate descriptive statistics, bibliometric measures, and for science 
mapping (Aria and Cuccurullo, 2017). Bibliometrix was chosen for the 
analysis as it provides a suite of functions adapted to bibliometric 
analysis and provides output that can be further manipulated using the 
open-source R5 language and environment. In this study, the R language 
allowed for the tailoring and automation of data analysis scripts calling 
on Bibliometrix functions and objects and third-party packages for more 
specific analyses. This was particularly useful for data manipulation, 
extraction and multiple bibliometric calculations using a large data set 
(14 480 journals, 40 147 publications, 83 346 authors, 128 countries, 15 
542 institutions). 


Several statistics are available for bibliometric performance analysis. 
In this study, following Gaviria-Marin et al. (2019) the main statistics 
used to evaluate productivity and influence are the h-index and its de-
rivative, the m-index. The h-index is defined as “the number of papers 
with citation number ≥h” (Hirsch, 2005), where h is the number of 
papers published. For example, an h-index of 20 indicates that an indi-
vidual has published twenty papers with at least 20 citations. The 


advantage of the h-index is that it measures both productivity and in-
fluence and can be calculated for different bibliometric units of analysis: 
authors, countries, journals, and institutions. The m-index adjusts the 
h-index for the “academic age” of the individual (i.e., m = h/academic 
age). Academic age is the number of years since the publication of an 
individual’s first paper. Other statistics used are derived from yearly 
research output and citation counts. 


The first part of this paper (4.1) examines the current state of the AI 
literature using performance analysis. The objective is to identify the 
main themes and contributing disciplines to AI research, the key actors 
in the field. 


The second part of the paper (4.2) focuses on the state of research in 
the ten social impact domains described by (Chui et al., 2018) (see 
Appendix 1). We use bibliometric performance measures to summarize 
the extant research by domain. 


4. Results 


4.1. The current state of the AI literature 


Publications on mainstream AI research in the corpus began in 1975 
with 13 publications and that number grew to 7 037 publications per 
year in 2019, for an annual publication growth rate of 20%. This growth 
rate is strong compared to the global scientific publication output that is 
growing at a rate of approximately 3% annually (Bornmann and Mutz, 
2015). 


A number of production peaks can be observed across this 45-year 
period in Fig. 2, each corresponding to a technical or conceptual 
development in the field (Jin et al., 2018). For example, the first period 
of strong growth in AI research began in the early 1980s, following the 
XCON expert system’s development. In 1988, probabilistic reasoning 
was introduced and became a new theoretical foundation for intelligent 
systems research (Pearl, 2014). In 1997 the first chatbot, “Jabberwacky” 
was developed (McNeal and Newyear, 2013), and IBM’s Deep Blue beat 
the reigning world champion, Garry Kasparov, in a game of chess. The 
next major peak was in 2009 when Google released the first self-driving 
car that could navigate in urban conditions (Marr, 2018). The dramatic 
increase in AI publications from 2013 onwards can be explained by the 
growth in big data in 2012 (Zhang et al., 2019) and deep learning in 
2015 (LeCun et al., 2015) with the success of Google’s Alpha Go (Silver 
et al., 2016), which significantly increased AI research projects and in-
dustrial applications. 


AI research covered a total of 149 subject areas over the period. 
Table 2 lists the most frequently observed areas and the number of 
references per research area. The two dominant disciplines were com-
puter science and engineering. The acronyms for all tables are provided 
in Appendix 2. 


Four application areas exhibited an increase in average annual 
growth during the AI Fall: Operations research & management science, 
Mathematics, Psychology, and Information science & library science. The 
average annual growth fell in all other areas between the two periods. 


Bibliometric techniques were applied to the corpus to analyze the AI 
research field’s current state and evolution. The following three sections 
identify the most influential sources, authors, countries, and institutions 
in AI research. The conceptual structure of the field is then described, 
followed by an analysis of its evolution. 


4.1.1. The most productive and influential journals in AI 
Artificial intelligence research is undertaken in a large variety of 


areas. Some fields contribute to the development of technologies, 
models, and algorithms, while others are fields of application. Research 
is published in a large range of journals. To classify this work, Table 3 
presents the 50 most productive and influential journals in AI. The 
journals are ordered according to the total scholarly production in AI 
(TPAI) and the h-index computed based on citations by AI publications 
in the corpus (hAI). Acronyms for all journals are listed below the table.

Eleven journals concern application areas of AI with a strong inter-
play between society and technology, including operations and 
manufacturing (EJOR, IJAMT, JIM, IJPR), energy and sustainability 
(EES, SUST, RSER), agriculture (CEA), hydrology (JHYD), chemicals 
(JACS) and decision making (DSS). The thirty-nine remaining journals 
all concern either directly or indirectly the development, testing, and 
analysis of AI models, methods, and technologies. 


The most productive journal was ESA, although the percentage of 
articles on AI (%PAI) in this journal is quite low (3.52%). Two journals 
with fewer publications but high levels of influence (high h-index and % 
PAI) are AIMAG and AI. AI has 8 articles with over 200 citations by other 
AI publications, and two publications in the 50 most cited papers in the 
field (Table 4). Interestingly, only 8 journals appear in the Top 50 
publications by citation count. This result reflects the diverse nature of 
AI research. 


Several journals show an increasing interest in AI research, measured 
by the TPAI growth rate and the journal space accorded to AI articles. 
Nine journals exhibited annual growth in AI publications above 70% 
during the period studied: in order of productivity and influence they are 
IEEEA (182%), SENS (71%), IFAC (94%), ASB (429%), EES (85%), IET- 
CV (83%), SUST(193%), SCRP (84%) and JOE (312%). These fast- 
growing journals are all open access. The outlets that publish the 
largest proportion of their articles on AI are AIMAG (20.7%), AIR 
(11.8%), MM (17.6%), and ITCAIG (20.9%). 


It is also interesting to examine journal productivity over time. The 
number of papers published per year by 42 of the top 50 journals 
increased during the AI Fall compared to the AI Winter but fell for EJOR, 
AAI, FSS, AMAI, CI, DSS, ITKDE, and ITCIAIG. There are also many 
young (YP≥2009), influential journals (mAI>1.5) in the field, including 
IEEEA, SENS, ASB, SUST, RSER, EES and SCRP. 


4.1.2. The most influential publications in the field of AI 
The AI field attracted an increasing number of scholars during the AI 


Fall, with an equivalent number of papers published over these five 
years as in the previous 40-year AI Winter. To identify the leading papers 
in AI research, Table 4 ranks the top 50 publications by total citations in 
all fields (TC). In the case of a tie, papers are ranked by total citations in 
AI research (TCAI). 


All but two of the top fifty papers were published after 1991, and ten 
of the most influential papers were published after 2010. Nine of the ten 
most influential articles present technical or conceptual advances in the

development of AI technologies. The most cited study is a paper by 
Barsalou (1999) entitled “Perceptual symbol systems” in which he pre-
sents a theory of perceptual symbols with implications for neuroscience 
and artificial intelligence. One explanation for this paper’s influence is 
that it provides a theoretical foundation of many studies on cognition, be 
it in AI or cognitive psychology. Given that perception is a key capability 
of AI systems, the perceptual theory of knowledge developed in this 
paper has been used to guide research and development of the percep-
tual components of AI systems, including research on sensors that enable 
AI systems to capture information from their environment to simulate 
human behavior. 


The second most cited paper is Kschischang et al. (2001) on “Factor 
graphs and the sum-product algorithm”. This paper underlies the 
development of several AI algorithms used today, such as Bayesian 
networks, Markov networks, and random forests, due to the improved 
accuracy they provides when computing message-passing algorithms. 


The paper entitled “Mastering the game of Go with deep neural 
networks and tree search” by Silver et al. (2016) is the third most cited 
paper. It reports on how deep neural networks trained in the game of Go 
achieved a near-perfect winning rate against other Go programs and 
defeated the human European Go champion. This paper marks a major 


achievement in the field of artificial intelligence as Go is considered a 
difficult game to master owing to its vast search space and the difficulty 
evaluating the value of board positions and moves. 


The fourth most cited paper by Wooldridge and Jennings (1995) 
entitled “Intelligent agents: Theory and practice” presents the theoret-
ical and practical issues in the design and construction of intelligent 
agents. The paper discusses agent theory, agent architectures, and agent 
languages, and is relevant to the growing number of intelligent agent 
applications. Today’s most popular intelligent agents are Google’s 
Google Assistant, Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, and Microsoft’s Cortana. 
The growth of business and domestic applications of these technologies 
has increased research interest in the fundamentals of this AI 
technology. 


The fifth and six most cited papers also developed theoretical un-
derpinnings for AI applications: Gruber (1995) published “Toward 
principles for the design of ontologies used for knowledge sharing?” on 
the role and development of formal ontologies as a way of sharing and 
reusing knowledge among software entities; Glover (1986) published 
“Future paths for integer programming and links to artificial intelli-
gence” summarizing recent developments that offer promise to enhance 
the solving of combinatorial optimization problems

Brooks (1991) paper entitled “Intelligence without representation” 
presents an approach to building complete intelligent creatures, such as 
mobile robots that can operate without supervision. The importance of 
this paper can be explained by the increasing use of AI in robotics. 


Esteva et al. (2017) published “Dermatologist-level classification of 
skin cancer with deep neural networks” that reports on the use of deep 
convolutional neural networks, trained using a dataset of clinical images 
to automatically classify skin lesions. 


Mannsfeld et al. (2010) report on the development of an electronic 
skin that can be used as an active sensory device by artificial intelligence 
that comes into direct contact with humans in their paper “Highly sen-
sitive flexible pressure sensors with microstructured rubber dielectric 
layers”. 


The tenth article in the list is by Venkatasubramanian et al. (2003) 
entitled “A review of process fault detection and diagnosis: Part I: 
Quantitative model-based methods”, a review paper of fault detection 
and diagnosis methods for process engineering. Artificial intelligence 
techniques are increasingly employed for process fault diagnosis. 


Only seven of the top 50 papers present a concrete application of AI 
that could be considered to have a societal impact, according to the 
classification by Chui et al. (2018). The paper by Esteva et al. (2017) on 
the detection of skin cancers can be classified in social impact domain 6 
“Health and hunger”. Adam et al. (2002) develop a protein profiling 
system for the early detection of prostate cancer using an artificial in-
telligence learning algorithm to differentiate cancerous from noncan-
cerous proteomic patterns. This article can also be classified in social 
impact domain 6 “Health and hunger”. Zhao and Magoulès (2012) re-
view recently developed engineering, statistical, and artificial intelli-
gence models and methods for predicting building energy consumption. 
Lei et al. (2009) review and assess wind power forecasting models, 
including new methods based on artificial intelligence. These two arti-
cles can be classified in social impact domain 8 “Infrastructure man-
agement”. Pennebaker et al. (2003) explore the psychological aspects of 
natural language use and can be classified in social impact domain 6 
“Health and hunger” under the mental health theme. Tam and Kiang 
(1992) study of how neural networks can be used to predict bank failures 
can be classified under social impact domain 9 “Public and social sector 
management”. And finally, Mangels et al. (1993) used artificial intelli-
gence to measure the carotenoid content of fruit and vegetables and 
generate a database that can be used to examine the association between 
dietary carotenoids and disease incidence. This paper can also be clas-
sified in impact domain 6 “Health and hunger”. 


4.1.3. The most productive and influential authors in AI research 
Over 80 000 authors contributed to the papers in our corpus, of 


which 52 562 published their work during the AI Fall. Ranking of au-
thors by productivity and influence helps describe the intellectual dy-
namics of the field. Table 5 ranks authors according to their AI adjusted 
h-index (hAI) and total citations (TCAI). Statistics in the table are based 
on all publications, including both first and co-authorships. 


The most published and influential author in the corpus is Ozgur Kisi 
from Iran, with an h-index of 19 and the majority of his production 
during the AI Fall. The author works in the areas of engineering and 
water resources, and his most cited paper (TC 203, TCAI 47) as first 
author is “Forecasting daily lake levels using artificial intelligence ap-
proaches” published in Computers & Geosciences (Kisi et al., 2012). This 
paper tests and compares three artificial intelligence approaches to 
predict lake-level variations. 


The second-ranked author is Gilles Klopman, publishing in the areas 
of genetics, heredity, and toxicology. The author’s most cited paper is 
“Artificial intelligence approach to structure-activity studies. Computer 
automated structure evaluation of biological activity of organic mole-
cules” published in Journal of the American Chemical Society (Klopman, 
1984). All of Klopman’s publications appeared during the AI Winter. 


There are also seven young (YP > 2016) and influential authors (mAI 
> 3) on the list: H. Shahabi and K. Chapi (Iran) working in engineering 


and geology, A Shirzadi (Vietnam) in environmental sciences, ecology 
and engineering, BT. Pham (Norway) in engineering and materials sci-
ence, M. Panahi (Iran), K. Khosravi (Vietnam), and B. Bin Ahmad 
(Malaysia) in engineering and chemistry. 


The most productive and influential authors publish in a wide variety 
of fields. The most frequently observed areas are engineering (21% of 
total areas provided) and computer science (20%). This is not surprising 
given the technical nature of the field. It is interesting to note the di-
versity of the 22 other, often secondary areas, including geology (8% of 
total areas), water resources (5%), and materials science (4%). Table 6 
presents the frequency of all 85 areas cited by the top 50 ranked authors. 


While engineering and computer science dominate the list, closer 
inspection reveals a “long tail” of 83 other research areas within the AI 
field. This result illustrates the large variety of application areas for AI 
research, and the potential for AI research to have a social impact. 


4.1.4. The most productive and influential institutions in AI research 
Over 15 000 institutions contributed to AI research over the 45-year 


period. The 50 most productive and influential author affiliations are 
presented in table 7, ordered by the h-index (HAI) and total citations in 
AI research (TCAI). 


Institutions in the USA, China, and the UK dominate the table. Two in 
three of the top 50 institutions are based in one of these three countries. 
The remaining 17 institutions are spread across 8 countries: Canada, 
Iran, Singapore, Greece, Malaysia, India, Netherlands, and France. All of 
the 50 top-ranked institutions began publishing in AI during the AI 
Winter, with a median start year of 1986. 


Stanford University (USA) is the most productive and influential 
institution, accounting for 3 articles amongst the top 50 publications, 
and 8 publications with over 200 citations. The second most productive 
institution is Carnegie Mellon University (USA), with 1 article in the top 
50 and 7 with over 200 citations. The University of London (UK) and 
Hong Kong Polytechnical University (China) are in third and fourth 
position with a slightly lower h-index than CMU but a higher number of 
average citations per article in AI research. Despite the dominance of 
North American institutions, four of the five fastest-growing institutions 
are in Iran and China: Islamic Azad University (48%), University of 
Tehran (51%), University of Tabriz (53%), Tsinghua University (38%) 
and Harvard Medical School (100%) 


Several institutions have maintained their influence over time, as 
highlighted by their m-index in AI research (mAI > 1.5), including Is-
lamic Azad University (Iran), University of Malaya (Malaysia), Univer-
sity of Tehran (Iran), University of Tabriz (Iran) and Harvard Medical 
School (USA). The University of Illinois publishes the highest proportion 
of research in AI compared to all other institutions on the list. 


4.1.5. The most productive and influential countries in AI research 
We can also identify the most productive and influential countries in 


AI research. From the 128 countries that contributed to AI scholarship 
between 1975 and 2019, Table 8 presents the top 50 countries based on 
their h-index and total citations in AI research. The table is based on 
publications where the country appears as the main affiliation of the first 
author. 


Consistent with the result presented previously, the USA, the United 
Kingdom, China, and Canada are the four most productive and influ-
ential countries in AI research. The USA dominates the rankings with a 
significantly higher h-index (HAI), research output (TPAI), and total 
citations (TCAI) than second-place United Kingdom. American re-
searchers also contribute close to half of all top 50 publications in AI, 
compared to 9 from the UK. On the other hand, the UK demonstrates a 
greater intercountry collaboration (MCP) level than the USA and higher 
per-capita AI research output and number of citations. 


High production volumes but low average citations raise the issue of 
the relative visibility of publications from countries such as China, Italy, 
India, France, and Germany compared to the USA, the UK, Canada, and 
Iran. This is also the case for countries with high annual growth rates in 


S. Fosso Wamba et al.

research output (CAGR > 20%), including Korea, Saudi Arabia, Viet-
nam, Pakistan, and Indonesia. 


Several smaller, less known countries are also productive and influ-
ential in the field. The three countries with the highest per capita level of 
publications and citations are Singapore, Ireland, and Slovenia. As a 
share of national research output over the same period, AI publications 
are highest in Algeria, Romania, and Indonesia. This result confirms 
previous research into the “long tail” in scientific production: a large 
number of lesser-known outlets collectively contribute significantly to 
scientific production (Wu et al., 2009). 


The AI field is collaborative by nature, with over 80% of documents 


between 1975 and 2019 published by multiple authors, increasing to 
84.5% during the AI Fall. Intercountry collaborations are measured by 
the MCP ratio, the fraction of articles where co-authors belong to 
different countries (i.e. multi-country papers/total papers). As a refer-
ence point, the USA had an average MCP of 0.12 over the period, indi-
cating that 12% of papers were authored with scholars with affiliations 
in other countries than the USA. Fifteen countries had MCP ratios equal 
to or above 0.25, reflecting a strong level of intercountry collaboration: 
Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, Switzerland, Belgium, Portugal, Swe-
den, Saudi Arabia, New Zealand, Vietnam, Denmark, Finland, Norway, 
Pakistan, and Tunisia.

The preceding bibliometric analysis shows that although dominated 
by North American scholars, the AI research field is internationally 
diverse, with a main focus on technical or conceptual advances in the 
development of AI models and technologies. The “long tail” of subject 
areas and lower ranked journals underscores the richness of scholarship 
in the AI field. The following section further explores the conceptual 
structure of AI scholarship. 


4.1.6. Thematic evolution of the field 
The thematic evolution of a scientific field can be quantified and 


visualized (Cobo et al., 2011) using co-word analysis. Co-word analysis 
identifies groups or clusters of keywords that represent the different 
conceptual themes developed within a research field for the subperiod 
under study. Each cluster can be described according to its centrality and 
density. Centrality measures the strength of the links between a cluster 
and other clusters. According to Callon et al., 164, “the more numerous 
and stronger are these links, the more this cluster designates a set of 


research problems considered crucial by the scientific or technological 
community”. A cluster with a high degree of centrality occupies a stra-
tegic position in a research field. Density measures the strength of the 
links between the keywords within a cluster and describes “the cluster’s 
capacity to maintain itself and to develop over the course of time in the 
field under consideration” (Callon et al., 1991, p. 165). 


Research subfields can be mapped to a two-dimensional space, called 
a “strategical graph” (Callon et al., 1991) or “strategic diagram” (Cobo 
et al., 2011) according to the level of centrality and density of each 
cluster. An example of a strategic diagram is presented in Fig. 3. 


Quadrant 1 is made up of clusters central to the research domain 
(high centrality) and highly developed, exhibiting strong internal links 
(high density). These clusters often represent core fields of study and 
have been developed over time by a well-defined group of researchers. 
Clusters in quadrant 2 are also important to the field but they are 
generally less developed than clusters in quadrant 1. These clusters may 
represent themes that are growing in importance, but that require more 
significant investment before they mature. Quadrant 3 clusters are well 
developed but not well connected to other themes within the field. 
Typically, these themes are specialized and peripheral in nature, and 
while they may have been central at one point, they have been thor-
oughly investigated and today are less relevant to the field. Clusters in 
quadrant 4 are peripheral and little developed, representing either 
emerging or declining themes. 


We analyzed the evolution of AI research themes across two time 
periods: the “AI Winter” from 1975 to 2014 and the “AI Fall” from 2015 
to 2019. Figs. 4 and 5 present the strategic maps of the main AI research 
themes and trends for each period based on the 250 most frequent 
keywords provided by authors. Each circle’s size represents the number 
of occurrences of cluster keywords, and the label represents the most 
frequent keyword in that cluster over the period. Tables 9 and 10 list the 
keywords per cluster by their frequency. 


The central, motor themes during the AI Winter were “expert sys-
tems” and “knowledge representation”. During this period, the focus of 
AI research was mainly on expert systems. An expert system are 
knowledge-based systems that emulate expert thought to solve signifi-
cant problems in a particular domain of expertise (Sell, 1986, p. 25). 
“Knowledge representation” was also a motor theme during the AI 
Winter because knowledge was such an important input into rule-based 
AI algorithms. Accordingly, the representation of knowledge became 
“one of Al’s top research priorities” (Patterson, 1990) during the period. 
Research in expert systems and knowledge representation had several 
successful applications during the period, such as IBM’s Deep Blue 
computer that defeated the reigning world champion Garry Kasparov in 
a game of chess in 1997 (Newborn, 2000). 


An emerging theme that also attracted significant scholarly attention 
during the period was neural networks. This large cluster grouped 
several themes, including artificial neural networks, genetic algorithms, 
and fuzzy logic, and reflects the search for alternative models of human 
reasoning by AI scholars. Since the start of the AI Spring, artificial neural 
networks have been at the very core of artificial intelligence research. In 
the 1940s, the first computational model for neural networks was 
introduced by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts (1943) while artificial 
intelligence scientists started applying the neural plasticity principles 
developed by Donald Hebb (1949) to computational models. AI research 
on artificial neural networks stagnated until the beginning of the AI 
Winter as influential AI researchers pointed out the limits of the use of 
neural networks in computational machines (Minsky and Papert, 1969), 
mainly due to the overall lack of processing power. Hopes were revived 
and interest renewed at the start of the AI Winter with a general increase 
in the processing power of machines but also with significant algo-
rithmic advances such as Werbos’s (1974) backpropagation algorithm 
and the introduction of parallel distributed processing algorithms when 
simulating neural processes (Rumelhart and McClelland, 1986). 


A smaller emerging cluster focused on machine learning, data min-
ing, and classification. Machine learning and data mining are closely

related, as they often employ similar methods. However, while machine 
learning’s main focus is to make predictions based on known properties 
learned from training data, data mining is more about discovering un-
known properties from data. In the 1970s and 1980s, a substantial sub- 
stream of AI research was dedicated to pattern recognition (e.g. Duda 
and Hart, 1973). As companies and scientists began capturing huge 
volumes of historical data during the 1990s, more and more data min-
ing, classification techniques, and machine learning algorithms were 
used by both scientists and businesses (Mitchell, 1999). Meanwhile, 
machine learning research evolved significantly with the introduction of 
‘boosting’, a concept that helped reduce inherent supervised learning 
biases by relying on the principle that a set of weak learners can create 
one single strong learner (Schapire, 1990). 


We can observe from Fig. 5 that expert systems were no longer a 
significant AI research area during the AI Fall. This thematic evolution 
can be explained by the limits of such systems. Expert systems perform 
well in areas that lend themselves to the formalisation of human 


intelligence but perform poorly when interpreting and learning from 
external data, and thus technically speaking are “not true AI” (Haenlein 
and Kaplan, 2019). 


The principal theme during this period was learning, including 
feature extraction, computer vision, and image classification revealing a 
growing interest in using AI to learn about real-world phenomena 
through image processing. The keywords per cluster are listed in 
Table 10 by order of importance. 


Today, AI research focuses mostly on the learning and adaptive ca-
pabilities of AI. A number of other AI technologies including speech and 
pattern recognition are also important for industrial AI systems but are 
so far more developed in practice than in research (Bawack et al., 2019). 
The emergence of the learning cluster coincides with a growing interest 
in image recognition techniques and increased investment in computer 
vision and face recognition technologies by large organizations such as 
Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Tesla. For example, the launch 
of DeepFace by Facebook in 2015, a deep learning facial recognition

system, has raised a lot of public attention but also substantial research 
efforts. 


The emerging, although loosely linked machine learning cluster 
continued to develop during the period, attracting research on robotics, 
neural networks, big data, deep learning, and convolutional neural 
networks from other clusters. The fall in density from the first period 
indicates that while the cluster grew, the links between keywords within 
the cluster are weaker prefiguring a splintering of the cluster over time. 
One way to explain such evolution could be in the tumultuous and 
intertwined history of the artificial intelligence and machine learning 
fields. Around the early 1980s, the artificial intelligence and machine 
learning industries took separate paths while machine learning 
continued to be used as training programs for AI. Recent advances in 
deep learning, neural networks, and natural language processing tech-
niques have created multiple links between the two domains. As 
Christopher D. Manning notes: “Deep Learning waves have lapped at the 
shores of computational linguistics for several years now, but 2015 
seems like the year when the full force of the tsunami hit the major 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) conferences.” (Manning, 2015, p. 
701). 


Research in the large, emerging cluster on neural networks during 
the AI Winter shed the keyword “neural network” and transformed into 
a denser and central artificial neural networks cluster. Today, artificial 
neural networks are one of the most important areas in both AI research 
and the application of AI technologies in business. Neural networks are 
used by organizations for a range of tasks including social network 
filtering, marketing campaign optimization, financial trading system 
design, and improved disease identification and diagnosis. 


4.2. State of research into AI for social good 


The main themes, journals, and articles that have dominated the AI 
literature over the past 45 years have been technical in nature. To 
explore the extent of research in areas where AI could be applied for 
social good, we searched for papers in the corpus developing each of the 
ten social impact domains identified by Chui et al. (2018). The 
domain-specific research queries are provided in Appendix 3. Table 11 
presents the descriptive statistics for the papers in the reduced corpus. 


A total of 1048 documents were published across the ten AI for social

good domains, representing 2.6% of all AI research in the corpus. The 
collaboration index was higher than for the entire corpus indicating that 
research on AI for social good more often involves multiple authors. The 
growth rate for this subset was also higher as was the number of citations 
per document. 


The publication period is shorter than that of the AI corpus, covering 
twenty-nine years from 1991 to 2019. Fig. 6 presents the publications 
per year across the period. 


The two earliest publications appeared in 1991: a case study by 
Bijoch et al. (1991) on an intelligent power system alarm processor at 
Northern States Power Co. published in IEEE Transactions on Power 
systems and an editorial by Batty and Yeh (1991) on the promise of 
expert systems for urban planning published in Computers, Environment 
and Urban Systems. 


AI research covered a total of 106 subject areas over the period. The 
two dominant areas were computer science and engineering. The 
number of references per research area is provided in Table 12. 


Three application areas exhibited an increase in average annual 
growth during the AI Fall, including Operations research & management 
science, Robotics, and Radiology, nuclear medicine & medical imaging. The 
average annual growth rate fell in all other areas between the two 
periods. 


We used Chui et al. (2018)’s review of potential areas of AI for social 
impact as a framework to describe and analyze the state of research in AI 
for social good and to identify opportunities for future research. The 
authors present a study by the McKinsey Global Institute of 160 AI use 
cases and ten domains where AI technologies could have a large-scale

social impact. The domains cover the seventeen United Nations Sus-
tainable Development Goals and include crisis response, economic 
empowerment, educational challenges, environmental challenges, 
equality and inclusion, health and hunger, information verification and 
validation, infrastructure management, public and social sector man-
agement, security and justice. The ten social impact domains are pre-
sented in Appendix 2. 


The percentages of papers in the AI for social good corpus that have 
been published in each domain are presented in Fig. 7. Three social 
impact domains have attracted over three quarters of research interest: 
health and hunger (47% of publications), infrastructure management 
(26%), and environmental concerns (11%). 


Six domains accounted for less than 10% of publications including 
social equality and inclusion (1.7%), economic empowerment (0.6%), 
security and justice (1.3%), educational challenges (2%), information 
verification and validation (1.3%), and public and social sector man-
agement (0.8%). 


Table 13 ranks AI social domain output according to average docu-
ment global citations. The most cited domain is security and justice, 
followed by equality and inclusion and environmental challenges. Five 
domains have below-average citations: health and hunger, educational 
challenges, economic empowerment, public and social sector manage-
ment, and information verification and validation. One explanation for 
the last three domains may be that they are relatively recent, as shown 
by the narrow date ranges. However, health and hunger is one of the 
oldest domains with the highest publication count but low average 
citations. 


Bibliographic statistics by domain and key issues are provided in 
Appendix 4. The following section examines the production in each of 
the ten social impact domains, according to issue types addressed or 
ignored by AI research. 


4.2.1. Crisis response 
Crisis response refers to the management of crises such as man-made 


and natural disasters, disease outbreaks, search and rescue missions, and 
humanitarian crises. A total of eighty-four publications in the corpus 
concern this domain, written between 1996 and 2019, with half of all 
documents published from 2016 onwards. Most publications concern 
responses to natural and man-made disasters (n = 34) and search and 
rescue efforts (39), whereas few address disease outbreaks (10) and 
humanitarian or migration crises (2). Keyword analysis reveals that the 


main topics covered in papers on disaster response are artificial neural 
networks, geographical information systems, and ANFIS. Research on 
search and rescue has focused on robotics, multi-agent systems, and 
computer vision. 


The most cited paper in this domain is an article entitled “Human- 
robot interaction in rescue robotics” published in IEEE Transactions on 
Systems, Man, and Cybernetics by Murphy (2004). It is a tutorial paper on 
how robots are currently used in urban search and rescue and the 
human-robot integration issues encountered. 


4.2.2. Economic empowerment 
Economic empowerment involves providing access to resources and 


opportunities, in particular for vulnerable populations. This was the 
most under-researched domain with only six articles identified in the 
corpus that were written between 2013 and 2018: three papers per-
tained to agricultural quality and yield and three concerned the use of AI 
to stimulate economic growth for vulnerable populations. No papers 
were found to address financial inclusion or labor supply and demand 
matching. Keyword analysis revealed that research into agricultural 
quality and yield concerned classification and plant disease analysis. No 
common keywords were found between the publications on economic 
growth initiatives. 


The most cited paper in this area is “Artificial intelligence policy in 
India: a framework for engaging the limits of data-driven decision- 
making” published in Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A by

Marda (2018). The article proposes a framework for AI-based policy 
deliberations using India’s current AI policy landscape as a backdrop. 
According to the author, AI policy in India is particularly oriented to-
wards AI for economic growth and social good. 


Today, a new generation of AI that could impact economic empow-
erment is emerging. For example, Montes and Goertzel (2019) propose 
an AI approach that operates in a decentralized, distributed, and more 
democratized manner, potentially improving services and addressing 
ethical issues in some markets. 


4.2.3. Educational challenges 
Educational challenges include improving student achievement and 


increasing teacher and administrative productivity. A total of 21 pub-
lications were found in the corpus dealing with this social domain. Most 
papers involved maximizing student achievement and performance 
(n = 19) and focus on machine learning, assessment, autism, fuzzy logic, 
and prediction. Only two publications dealt with access to and 
completion of education, and no papers were found addressing AI for 
teacher and administrative productivity. According to author-provided 
keywords, the two papers on education access dealt with online edu-
cation, the theory of mind, the Turing test, and virtual teaching 
assistants. 


A sample paper from this domain is entitled “Evaluation of student 
performance in laboratory applications using fuzzy logic” published in 
Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences by Gokmen et al. (2010). The 
paper proposes and tests a new performance evaluation method based 
on fuzzy logic systems. 


4.2.4. Environmental challenges 
Environmental challenges involve protecting natural resources and 


biodiversity, improving energy efficiency, and combatting climate 
change. A total of 113 papers concerning AI and environmental issues 
were identified in the corpus, published between 1994 and 2019, with 
one-half of all publications appearing from 2018 onwards. The majority 
of papers concerned global warming, climate change, and adaptation 
(n = 105), with a focus on deep learning, artificial neural networks, and 
smart grids. One in four papers on environmental challenges answered 
questions of animal and plant conservation and biodiversity, with a 
particular focus on ARtificial Intelligence for Ecosystem Services 
(ARIES) technology and machine learning. Few papers were found to 
have addressed energy efficiency and sustainability (2) or land, air, and 
water conservation (5). 


The most cited paper in this collection is entitled “It’s about time: A 
conceptual framework for the representation of temporal dynamics in 
geographic information systems” published in Annals of the Association 
of American Geographers by Peuquet (1994). The article proposes an 
integrated approach for representing spatiotemporal data in geographic 
information systems. 


4.2.5. Equality and inclusion 
Equality and inclusion involve reducing biases based on gender, 


disability, community, or race. This was one of the least researched areas 
in the corpus, with only 18 papers published between 2005 and 2019. 
The majority of papers concerned exploitation or discrimination on the 
basis of race, gender, handicap, religion, or sexual orientation (12), with 
a particular focus on conversational agents, game theory, and natural 
language processing. Six papers were published on accessibility and 
disabilities and no papers were found on AI and marginalized 
communities. 


The most cited paper in this domain is “Smart wheelchairs: A liter-
ature review” published in the Journal of rehabilitation research and 
development by (Simpson, 2005). 


4.2.6. Health and hunger 
Health and hunger is one of the oldest and most productive AI for 


social good impact domains. It covers early-stage diagnosis and 


improved treatment of illness, as well as optimized food distribution to 
avoid hunger. A total of 477 documents were published in this domain 
between 1992 and 2019, with half of all publications appearing over the 
last five years. One researched theme was health prevention and pre-
diction (n = 219). Analysis of co-occurring keywords identified three 
thematic groups: big data and precision medicine, prognosis and pre-
diction, and AI techniques for various health conditions. 


Another published theme around health was treatment and long- 
term care (269). Keyword analysis revealed three areas of interest: 
psychiatric care, diagnosis using chatbots and conversational agents, 
and the use of AI technologies for health care in general. 


Mental wellness and health was a third theme that attracted research 
attention across the period (76). Keyword analysis revealed a particular 
focus on natural language processing, chatbots, and mental health. A 
small number of documents were published on treatment delivery (6) 
and hunger (3). 


The most cited paper in this area is “Harnessing context sensing to 
develop a mobile intervention for depression” published in Journal of 
medical Internet research (Burns et al., 2011). The authors report on the 
experimental use of mobile phone sensors and machine learning algo-
rithms to detect unipolar depression in patients. Four papers on health 
issues are also ranked amongst the top 50 most influential publications 
in AI (see Table 4). 


4.2.7. Information verification and validation 
Information verification and validation involves the detection, 


filtering, and negating of false, misleading, or polarizing content. This 
domain is the youngest of the ten AI for social good domains, recently 
gaining attention with the increasing diffusion of “fake news” across 
social media. A total of 13 publications on this topic were identified in 
the corpus since 2015. The majority of publications concern fake or false 
news (11), with a main focus on deep learning, deception detection, and 
natural language processing. Only two articles have dealt with the po-
larization of opinion. 


The most cited document in this collection is a conference paper 
entitled “Fake news detection using naive Bayes classifier” by Granik 
and Mesyura (2017) that was presented at the 2017 IEEE First Ukraine 
Conference on Electrical and Computer Engineering (UKRCON). Using 
Facebook data, the article demonstrates how artificial intelligence can 
be used for fake news detection. 


4.2.8. Infrastructure management 
Infrastructure management involves improving the use and man-


agement of energy, water and waste, and optimizing transportation, real 
estate development, and urban planning for social good. This is the 
second most productive and oldest domain of AI research for social good 
with 272 publications appearing between 1991 and 2019. Most publi-
cations in this area are on energy management (153), with a particular 
focus on distributed power generation, machine learning, and energy 
management. A large number of publications also deal with water and 
waste management (76), often using deep learning and fuzzy logic. 
Publications on both of these themes also use neural networks. Urban 
planning has also received attention from researchers (31), most often 
addressing questions of smart cities and climate change. Some publi-
cations on real estate (20) and transportation management (12) also 
appeared during the period. 


The most cited paper in this area is “Multiobjective intelligent energy 
management for a microgrid” published in IEEE transactions on Industrial 
Electronics by Chaouachi et al. (2012). The authors investigated online 
energy management using intelligent microgrids under cost and emis-
sion minimization constraints. Two papers on infrastructure manage-
ment are ranked amongst the top 50 most influential publications in AI. 


4.2.9. Public and social sector management 
This domain includes all activities that seek to improve the perfor-


mance of public and social bodies, their financial management, and the

delivery of services to citizens. Only eight publications concerned this 
domain between 2014 and 2019, mainly dealing with government ser-
vices to citizens (9) and the effective management of the public sector 
(2). No publications in the corpus treated the use of AI for fundraising, 
the management of the social sector, or public finances. 


The most cited article in this domain is “IoT and AI for smart gov-
ernment: A research agenda” published in Government Information 
Quarterly by Kankanhalli et al. (2019). A second example of the possible 
role of AI in public and social sector management is provided by de 
Sousa et al. (2019) in their review of AI use in the public sector. One 
paper from this domain is ranked amongst the top 50 most influential 
publications in AI 


4.2.10. Security and justice 
The security and justice domain includes activities seeking to reduce 


crime and physical harm, improve policing, and ensure a fair judiciary. 
A small number of publications (13) addressed this domain between 
1996 and 2019, most on the theme of policing (10). Few publications 
addressed the use of AI for harm prevention (1) and fair prosecution (2). 


A representative and highly cited article in this area is “A data-driven 
software tool for enabling cooperative information sharing among po-
lice departments” and was published in the European Journal of Opera-
tional Research by Redmond and Baveja (2002). The authors present a 
police department decision support system that uses artificial Intelli-
gence software. 


Table 14 presents a breakdown of the ten social impact domains by 
journal, institution, and country. 


Once again, the USA, the UK, and China lead AI research in the 
majority of social impact domains. However, several smaller countries 
also participate in specific areas, such as Turkey on environmental 
challenges, Italy on information verification and validation, and Spain in 
infrastructure management. Many lower-ranked institutions also work 
on these issues, and most publications are in conferences rather than 
journals. 


5. Discussion 


This paper reviews the evolution and structure of AI research using 
bibliometric methods. The results provide insights into the conceptual, 
intellectual, and social structure of AI scholarship, as well as its past and 
emerging themes. The number of publications on AI has risen rapidly 
these past five years, with as many publications appearing since 2015 as 
over the preceding 40 years. The influence of publications has also 
increased, lending support to Haenlein and Kaplan’s periodization of AI 
research using the seasons: since 2015, scholars appear to be reaping the 
harvest of several past decades of conceptual and technical development 
and experimentation. 


The fastest-growing publication outlets are open access journals and 
in particular IEEE Access, Applied Sciences (Basel), Sensors, Energies, 
IET Computer Vision, Scientific Reports, Sustainability, IFAC Paper-
sonline and Journal of Engineering (JOE). Articles are accessible to all 
from their online publication date, giving authors a better chance to 
diffuse their research and make an impact in the field (Eysenbach, 2006; 
van Vlokhoven, 2019). Given the rapid evolution of AI, it is easy to 
understand why researchers feel the need to publish their research as 
quickly as possible. The quality and reputation of journals are also a 
consideration for authors, with IEEE Access the 2015 winner of the 
PROSE Award for the best new journal in science, technology, engi-
neering, and mathematics.6 


Several dominant research themes were found to characterize 
contemporary AI research, notably learning for feature extraction and 
image classification and machine learning using neural networks and 


big data. These themes have evolved from early, highly developed fields 
such as expert systems, knowledge representation, and neural networks. 
Our analysis shows that AI technologies, models, and applications are 
still at the center of AI research, with little or no influence from the 
social sciences, thus confirming previous work by Frank et al. (2019). 
However, the development of a large, emerging cluster on machine 
learning that notably includes research on big data and AI, and a smaller 
motor research cluster on AI learning and feature extraction reveals a 
growing interest in using AI to learn about real-world phenomena 
through image processing. 


We can observe a clear shift in AI research paradigms, from genetic 
algorithms, machine learning, and fuzzy sets to deep learning and con-
volutional neural networks. One explanation is that modeling using 
deep learning and convolutional neural networks, and possibly a com-
bination of their capabilities to form deep convolutional networks is 
more appropriate in complex environments than were previous tech-
niques, making them suited for complex learning tasks, especially those 
involving detecting, identifying, and processing images, videos, speech, 
text, and audio (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; LeCun et al., 2015). The volume 
of AI research applying these techniques is expected to increase over the 
coming years. 


Our findings show a growing emphasis on AI’s technical aspects and 
little research on the social and societal aspects that would shape a good 
AI society. Research on the ten AI for social good domains accounted for 
less than 3% of publications in the corpus. The most productive areas 
were health and hunger, infrastructure management, and environmental 
challenges. Unequal interest has been paid to research themes within 
these domains: three-quarters of research on environmental challenges 
has addressed global warming and climate change; most research on 
health and hunger has studied two themes (prediction and prevention, 
treatment and long-term care); and 80% of publications on an infra-
structure management deal with energy, water, and waste. 


Given the rapid technological evolution of the AI domain, a number 
of research questions remain unanswered about the possible positive 
impacts of AI on society and people. Drawing from the bibliometric 
analysis, the in-depth analysis of the professional literature, the dis-
cussion sessions between the researchers and the emerging literature on 
AI for good, a list of potential future research questions have been 
identified. Table 15 lists research questions in each of the ten social 
impact domains identified by Chui et al. (2018) that could guide 
scholars as they explore how AI can be developed for the good of society. 


These research questions complete and complement suggestions 
made by other studies (Cath et al., 2018; Duan et al., 2019; Russell et al., 
2015a). Scholars could further explore these domains through literature 
reviews and case studies to refine research questions and contribute to 
the knowledge base of AI for good. 


The results of our study should be read in light of their limitations. 
Firstly, some publications might have not been considered in our anal-
ysis if they were not present in the WoS Core Collection database. Sec-
ondly, while we use several well-established bibliometric tools for data 
analysis, insights are based on the authors’ expertise. A meta-analytical 
review of the literature may provide other insights the authors may have 
overlooked. This may be an avenue for future research. With these 
limitations in mind, we believe we have provided a comprehensive re-
view of AI scholarship, highlighted its evolution and knowledge struc-
ture, and suggested evidence-based research directions to develop AI for 
the good of society. 


6. Conclusion 


Our study has answered the call for greater research into how public 
and private actors should best harness AI technologies for good. Using a 
typology of domains where AI technologies could have an important 
social impact as a framework, we critically appraised 45 years of AI 
scholarship, described the current state of research, and identified many 
opportunities and directions for future research.

through domain and issue-specific research and, in so doing, help shape 
the directions in which AI will transform our societies.
