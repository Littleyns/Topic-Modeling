Abstract 


Program portfolio managers in digital transformation programs have a need for knowledge that can guide decisions related to the alignment of 
program investments with the sustainability and strategic objectives of the organization. The purpose of this research is to illustrate the utility of 
a framework capable of clarifying the cost-benefit tradeoffs stemming from assessing digitalization program investment risks in the military 
shipbuilding sector. Our approach uses Artificial Neural Network to quantify benefits and risks per project while employing scenario analysis 
to quantify the effects of operational constraints. A Monte Carlo model is used to generate data samples that support the execution of the Neural 
Network. This enables the use of Portfolio Management Theory principles to organize and estimate measures of performance of the 
digitalization project portfolio. We demonstrate the utility of the framework by means of a theoretical case study presenting several 
digitalization project investment scenarios. We conclude that the framework makes a contribution and call for additional work to extend this 
framework to formalize the portfolio assessment activity while including acceptable risk ranges that constrain the final fractions of budget 
allocations.

1. Introduction 


Operational and financial pressures in tandem with the 
increasing demands of customers have intensified stress for 
competent operations. The evolution of industrial systems 
operating within intricate competitive environments has 
placed substantial constraints on the configuration and 
performance of agile, efficient, and flexible business and 
institutional operations. Successful firms recognize that the 
continual enhancement of existing operations is essential to 
gaining and maintaining a competitive edge. These 
organizations engage in strategic management initiatives by 
employing effective project, program, and portfolio 
management techniques to improve their operational 
efficiency and responsiveness. However, while 88 percent of 


executives assert that strategy implementation is critical to 
their firms, only 61 percent recognize that their organizations 
frequently have struggled in bridging the gap between 
strategic goals and their everyday operation [1]. Furthermore, 
in the digital transformation era, a smaller fraction of 
executives confesses to truly engaging in digitalization 
projects as they might be considered a risky endeavor [2]. 
This gap suggests a lack of understanding that projects and 
programs are catalysts in strategic change [3] as they 
represent versatile structures that enable the realization of 
distinctive and innovative organizational offerings [4].  


Aligning digitalization projects or programs with strategic 
objectives has the greatest potential to add value to an 
organization [5,6]. Although, average organizations report 
that three of five projects and programs are not aligned to

strategy, those that are aligned to an organization’s strategy 
are successfully completed (71%) more frequently than 
projects that are misaligned (48%) [3]. Problems caused by 
misalignment include: confusion; waste of time, money and 
opportunity; diminished productivity; de-motivation of 
individuals and teams; internal conflicts and power struggles 
and ultimately project failure [7]. In a shipyard, resources that 
have been initially allocated to specific shipbuilding projects 
may be pulled away to temporarily serve other projects (e.g., 
maintenance, emergency repairs) [8]. For example, in the US 
shipbuilding industry, important delays caused by a high 
number of interactions from liberal concurrent engineering 
policies has led to an 18 year maintenance backlog [8,9].   


The alignment of projects and programs to strategic goals 
requires stakeholders to develop a consistent means of 
identifying, prioritizing, and defining metrics/outcomes and 
their aligned outputs [10]. In this alignment process, a 
program or project may be seen as a line of organized 
activities that is intended to advance a product, practice, 
procedure, or service towards meeting a need within the 
government or marketplace, contribute to some type of 
benefits (e.g., readiness, revenue), and contribute to the 
sustainability of the organization. In an intensive capital 
industry sector such as the military shipbuilding, this 
organizational configuration by project/program makes sense 
given the large number of non-repetitive and complex 
activities and tasks associated to it [11]. Firms and institutions 
that use this managerial perspective, generally group projects 
and programs that have the potential to advance a common 
organizational goal into portfolios that require continuous 
control and evaluation [12]. Thus, an organization may have 
several concurrent programs and each program may 
encompass one or more projects or programs that address the 
development of a product or capability that is understood to 
contribute to longer-term institutional sustainability.  


The shipbuilding industry that is largely characterized by 
using a project-based approach to manufacture ships, 
submarines, and engage in ship repair and overhaul [9] would 
largely benefit from the implementation of novel 
technological and operational means that seek to enhance its 
questionable performance. Digital transformation programs 
emerge as a means that seek to convert slow-, outdated-, and 
ill-defined operations into data-driven agile and at the same 
time lean operations based on the extensive use of Industry 
4.0 technology [13–15]. 


Mostly organized with a project-based configuration as 
well, resources are temporarily assigned to carry on digital 
transformation assignments that seek to increase industrial 
capabilities and become more efficient and largely flexible 
while increasing process and product integrity. These 
digitally-oriented initiatives are mostly based on data sharing 
and processing resulting in a paradigm shift in the way that 
organizations, such as shipbuilding, engage in decision-
making processes toward a data-driven approach [16].  Thus, 
a set of digital transformation projects may be further 
represented within a larger project or program portfolio, 
supervised by a digital transformation portfolio manager. The 


management of either a portfolio containing several projects, 
or a specific program encompassing a set of projects, entails 
an understanding of the mission of the organization and 
decision-making that will realize benefits that are of strategic 
importance [17,18]. Since the pursuit of programs and the 
continuation of projects require expenditure of finite 
organizational resources, the identification of digitalization 
projects that are most aligned with strategic priorities is 
critical for the success of the organization [19,20]. 


Digital portfolio and project managers must necessarily 
determine the variations in the amount of support among the 
projects in an effort to maximize the utility of the mix in 
advancing the organization towards its digital transformation 
strategic goals. This prioritization process frequently involves 
evaluating the relative risks, benefits, and costs among the 
projects [21]. Maximizing benefit-cost relationships while 
minimizing risks are common tasks performed in the planning 
and controlling stages of project portfolio management. 


Project portfolio managers seek to select or support 
projects within the project’s portfolio that traditionally 
balance benefits (mean) and risks (variance). Risk, however, 
may be measured using other forms, e.g., conditional value at 
risk (CVaR), Tail value at risk (TVaR), also known as tail 
conditional expectation (TCE), or conditional tail expectation 
(CTE). In this paper, the minimum variance opportunity set 
indicates combinations of risks and benefits that yield the 
minimum variance for a particular benefit. Hence, an efficient 
digitalization project portfolio frontier may identify 
investments in a set of projects where it is not possible to 
obtain less risky project combinations relative a desired 
benefit level.  


The following sections of this paper presents a background 
section that positions this work within the industrial context, 
presents an innovative digital shipbuilding supply chain 
framework; outlines a neural network analysis to examine 
digital projects using a digital shipbuilding supply chain 
perspective; presents a brief description of stochastic portfolio 
analysis; and introduces a framework integrating these 
approaches. This is followed by a brief analysis of a case 
study in the development research industry illustrating the 
application of the framework. The results stemming from the 
analysis of theoretical scenarios are presented and discussed. 
We then revisit and summarize the contributions of this work. 


2. The Shipbuilding and Shipyard Supply Chain 
Management Context 


In general, supply chain refers to all parties involved, 
directly or indirectly in fulfilling customer requests [22]. In 
the shipbuilding supply chain management context, activities 
upstream include procuring material and components from 
numerous, complex suppliers to managing the deactivation of 
ships and submarines downstream once they have reached 
their end-of-life. The basic elements of a shipbuilding supply 
chain management framework that seek to guide an 
understanding of a value chain of these processes is presented 
in Figure 1.

3. Digital Project Portfolio: Balancing Risk and Returns 


A balance among risks and returns is required for each 
combination of projects that compose the portfolio frontier. In 
an industry sector such as military shipbuilding, monitoring 
risk is an important endeavour as delays, labour availability, 
and large expenditures may drastically affect the readiness 
and sustainment of the fleet. The selection of these 
opportunity sets may be determined by the indifference curve 
map that describes the project strategic preferences and 
policies. Accordingly, an optimal risk management portfolio 
maximizes the average benefit while minimizing variance. 
The risk associated with a project portfolio containing 
multiple projects may be different from the risk associated 
with an individual project. The different associated risks and 
potential relationships among projects make project portfolio 
management a complex subject.  


The risk-benefit relationships associated with digital 
transformation projects in a shipbuilding project-based 
institution further increases the complexity as different types 
of risk exert compounding effects on the already multifaceted 
nature of the shipbuilding process. A proficient mechanism to 
assess this compounding effect is important for assessing and 
prioritizing digital transformation programs. 


We assert that Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and 
Monte Carlo simulation may be combined to offer a capable 
framework that assists digital transformation portfolio 
managers in performing an effective portfolio evaluation. The 
objective of this research is to describe this framework and its 
capacity to clarify the cost-benefit and risk trade-offs 
stemming from modifying project investments. The 
framework uses a hybrid between ANN and Monte Carlo 
capabilities to determine the benefits and risks per 
digitalization project considering the relationships that exist 
among multiple relevant projects’ attributes, e.g., time, 
control, and information. This Monte Carlo simulation 
approach generates complementary samples that assist in 
training the network model to increase its accuracy. 


4. Digital Transformation Risk Evaluation Framework 


A framework based on ANN to analyse project portfolios 
is presented in this section and illustrated in Figure 2. The 
approach uses ANN to determine the benefits and risk 
associated with projects within a portfolio of projects. A 


scenario analysis is performed to gain knowledge regarding 
impacts of new constraints per project. This knowledge is 
used to determine portfolio management measures of 
performance that include overall benefits and variances. In 
addition, project portfolio optimization can be potentially 
used to minimize the overall portfolio variance while 
maintaining risk-aversion and budget-constrained range 
restrictions. This framework adequately captures the 
complexities associated with determining risks and returns, 
relevant cost and benefit considerations guided by a proven 
assignment method. ANN assists by providing the critical 
elements that guide the resource assignment process. This 
framework consists of three stages summarized as follows. 


4.1. Quantifying risks and benefits of digital transformation 
projects 


Risk in projects is commonly defined in terms of exposure 
to explicit factors that present a threat to attaining the 
expected results. For example, the probability-weighted 
impact of an event on a project usually defines risk in 
software development projects [23]. The notion of risk, 
usually measured in dollars or time, may be characterized by 
R = P x I , where R represents the risk exposure that is related 
to an explicit risk issue while P is the probability the adverse 
event will be realized, and I is the effect of the loss if the 
undesired event materializes [24]. Often digital transformation 
development risks are managed by lists which are ranked by 
subjective qualitative measures resulting in excessive 
expenditure of risk management resources. Risk identification 
is the most critical step in risk management, yet often is 
poorly done [25]. As fundamental aspects of digitalization 
projects resemble those factors in software and hardware 
development, the uncertainties considered in this paper are 
guided by [26]. These uncertainties include time uncertainty, 
which reflects uncertainties about the occurrence of expected 
and unexpected events and the ability to react to them; control 
uncertainty that concerns with inadequate authority to make 
or influence decisions or inconsistency on processes; and 
information uncertainty, which concerns with inadequate or 
inaccurate information on which to base decisions. These 
authors also suggest an extensive list of potential project 
development risk concerns that includes but is not limited to 
creeping user requirements, large size and complexity of 
projects, complex applications, unnecessary features, and lack 
of user support.

Fig. 2. Digital Transformation Risk Evaluation Framework 


 
Project portfolio evaluations require reasonable estimations 


of the risks and associated benefits per project. The complex 
and stochastic nature of project risks makes the analysis of 
investment choices intended to mitigate risks, a candidate for 
ANN analysis. ANN models have been recognized in the IT 
development context as competent tools to reasonably 
estimate these values accurately [27].  


ANN models employ the concept of hidden layers which 
are composed of a number of neurons (hidden neurons). 
These models use mathematical functions to map inputs to 
outputs and may be conceived as a massively parallel adaptive 
network of simple nonlinear computing neurons, which are 
intended to characterize and mimic some of the functionality 
of the human nervous system in an effort to partially capture 
some of its computational strengths [28]. ANN can be 
described as a complex nonlinear characterization where the 
task of variable transformation, composite variable 
transformation, and model estimation are done simultaneously 
in such a way that a specified error function is minimized 
[29]. An appropriate number of hidden units depend on a 
relationship between the number of input and output units, the 
number of training cases, the type of hidden unit activation, 
and the training algorithm [30].  


 As a rule of thumb, it is well known that 30 observations 
are required in the input layer per neuron in the hidden layer. 
The ANN model cycles through an iterative process until a 
termination criterion is reached.  


In the studied context, the response model may reflect the 
risk related to the likelihood of the occurrence of undesirable 
events.  Thus, an overall project risk factor that relates 
individual risk elements per project can be defined as a target 
output. The ANN model obtained with historical data 


(supervised training) is then executed with new information 
about the assessed project portfolio, and thus the overall risk 
per project can be obtained (scoring process). 


4.2. Sampling Enhancement via Monte Carlo 


Empirically generated continuous or discrete probability 
distribution per risk component can be elicited from historical 
data, subject matter expert (SME) information, or a 
combination of both. These probability distributions per 
project risk level can be used to generate samples through a 
Monte Carlo simulation, and thus, to train the data that is used 
to calculate overall risk to projects. The historical data reflects 
a set composed of individual project risk factors and overall 
risk scores per project information. Additional Monte Carlo 
samples can be used to extend the historical and SME input 
data set to an acceptable number of observations to improve 
the accuracy of the ANN analysis. In this machine learning 
process, the sample data is partitioned into three major groups 
that include: learning (40%), training (30%), and testing 
(30%). The Levenberg-Marquardt optimization technique (see 
[31] for details) is used to train the data. 


4.3. Neural Network Scoring 


The knowledge created during the machine learning 
training and testing process may be described as the 
behavioral pattern of the effects resulting from different factor 
risk arrangements. Given a selection criterion, such as 
minimizing a set of error functions, the neural network model 
is generated. A second data source that corresponds to the risk 
scores of the assessed projects is obtained by applying the 






 Rafael Diaz  et al. / Procedia Manufacturing 42 (2020) 173–180 177
 Author name / Procedia Manufacturing 00 (2019) 000–000  5 


neural network model to calculate the overall risk per project 
as a target layer. To ensure the best neural network model is 
obtained for computing overall risk per project, different types 
of neural architecture can be used to train the data. However, 
workers are required to carefully assess these opportunities as 
each one might contain unacceptable risk levels (e.g., 
additional cyber risks) that can jeopardize the operational 
integrity. 


5. Case Study

investigates and develops digital solutions in the military 
domains is engaged in three types of digitalization 
development programs categorized by three risk levels (low, 
medium, and high) with equal possibility as exhibited in

Unlike most project studies that consider risk probabilities 


as a continuous distribution (e.g., beta or normal 
distributions), in this paper, we consider an empirically 
discrete modeled distribution for characterizing these 
probabilities. Thus, each individual risk probability is 
partitioned into five sub-levels (1-5). Each level considers 
both the probability of occurrence and associated risk degree 
represented nominally and measured from 0 to 1.  For each 
factor, the probability mass function adds up to 1. The risk 
factors considered in these projects include: 1. Creeping user 
requirements, 2. Large and project complexity, 3. Application 
complexity, 4. Unnecessary features, and 5. Lack of user 
support [26]. In addition, the manager ponders uncertainties 
within three additional dimensions that include 60% in time 
uncertainty, 10% in control uncertainty, and 30% in 
information uncertainty. Notice that as explained before, risk 
value represents a convoluted measure that characterizes the 
probability that a project will fail to meet its objectives. 


Table 2 presents the financial and individual risk factors 
for ten ongoing projects A through J which requires 
evaluation. The costs of each project as well as its cost as a 
share of the entire portfolio (estimated by the portfolio 
manager to be $124.7 million) are presented in the second and 
third columns, while individual project risk information is 
presented in columns four to eleven. 


5.1. Determine benefits and risks 


The portfolio manager computes the overall risk associated 
with each project in the portfolio during a risk analysis phase. 
This is done by assessing the importance, or weight, of the 
individual risk factor for each project. ANN is used to 
generate a model that can be used to relate individual risk 
factors and produce an overall risk score for each individual 
project. A simple ANN with 2 hidden layers with 8 neurons 
each and a single output is used to produce these risk scores 
(8-8-1) [32]. Eight was selected as this corresponds to each 
the five project risks and three uncertainties. SAS Miner 7.1 is 
employed to configure, execute, and compare the ANN 
models. 


The risk probability distribution presented in Table 1 per 
project risk level is used to generate samples through a Monte 
Carlo simulation, and thus, simulate the training data that is 
used to evaluate overall project risks of the projects presented 
in Table 2. Notice that some analysists and researchers might 
use the Monte Carlo technique to generate samples and then 
calculate averages in determining the overall project risks. 
However, in this paper the Monte Carlo simulation is limited 
only to determine samples that will feed the neural network 
model as other authors has considered. The machine learning 
approach used in this paper seeks to employ ANN as a better 
approximation of the real risk behaviour exhibited by the 
portfolio.

The historical data is based on a (disguised) data set 
comprising individual project risk factors and overall risk 
scores per project for 30 projects. More specifically, the 
Monte Carlo samples obtained using the probability 
distribution presented in Table 2 are used to extend the 
historical input data set from 30 project observations to 300 
observations. The sample data is further partitioned into three 
major groups that include: learning (40%), training (30%), 
and testing (30%).  


As previously discusses, the knowledge created during the 
training and testing process are assessed using 1. classical 
multilayer perceptron (MLP), 2. ordinary radial basis function 
with equal widths (ORBFEQ), 3. ordinary radial basis 
function with unequal widths (ORBFUN), 4. normalized 
radial basis with equal heights (NRBFEH), 5. normalized 
radial basis with equal volumes (NRBFEV), 6. normalized 
radial basis with equal widths (NRBFEW), 7. normalized 
radial basis with equal widths and heights (NRBFEQ), 8. 
normalized radial basis with unequal widths and heights 
(NRBFUN). As mentioned, the Average Square Error from 
the validating stage is used as the reference for model 
selection. Table 3 shows the statistical results of this 
comparison that suggests the normalized radial basis with 
equal widths and heights (NRBFEQ) architecture outperforms 
the alternative assessed ANN architectures. Thus, the 
NRBFEQ architecture is employed to determine the risk data. 
Once the ANN model using the NRBFEQ architecture is 
selected to execute the ANN model, the target variable which 
is overall risk per project is obtained as presented below in 
Table 4.

6. Summary and Managerial Implications 


Organizations may benefit from applying investment 
allocation approaches traditionally employed in financial 
markets analyses. A framework that combines the principles 
of Artificial Neural Network and Monte Carlo Simulation to 
analyze project portfolios may assist portfolio managers in 
their resource allocation activities. Our approach uses ANN to 


quantify benefits and risks per project while employing 
scenario analysis to quantify the effects of constraints per 
project. Monte Carlo simulation is used to obtain sample data 
that facilitates the execution of the neural network. The results 
from these simulations could be used to enable the use of 
Portfolio Management Theory principles to organize and 
estimate measures of performance and the utilization of 
nonlinear programming tools to minimize the overall portfolio 
variance while maintaining risk-aversion and budget-
constrained parameters. 


The digital transformation project risk evaluation 
framework offered follows a logical approach. First, it uses 
ANN to capture individual risk factors and quantify the 
overall risk of each project. Cost-benefit analysis is then 
employed to provide the foundation for performing a scenario 
analysis. An examination of the effects of selected scenarios 
can subsequently be performed. This examination is required 
to understand variations in the potential resources assigned 
per digitalization projects. Afterward, correlation and 
covariance matrices can be determined. These correlations 
may represent elicited perceptions that indicate how 
individual projects are related. The covariance matrix can 
relate the project correlations, the returns, and the variability 
or risk required. The overall digitalization project portfolio 
returns, and the portfolio variance can be then determined. 
Returns and variances can be subsequently recalculated given 
additional constraints. Thus, portfolio managers are able to 
optimize the distribution of available resources while 
preserving portfolio integrity.  


It is important for training analysts and managers to 
perform risk evaluations as the organization moves through 
digital transformation process while achieving strategic goals. 
In particular, organizations engaged in becoming data-driven 
managed and operated might consistently reveal vast 
opportunities to digitalize their operations. However, workers 
are required to carefully assess these opportunities as each one 
might contain unacceptable risk levels (e.g., additional cyber 
risks) that can jeopardize the operational integrity. Digital 
project portfolio analysts and managers are required to learn 
the type of risks that their portfolio may contain. Likewise, 
they should be trained in the use of competent tools to elicit 
projects risks and determine desired risk thresholds for their 
firm. This enables the anticipation of actions and plans that 
makes the organization more resilient as vulnerability might 
increase if risks are not properly elicited. Training modules 
might include introduction to digital supply chain to provide 
an overview of the shipbuilding context and risk 
quantification methodologies as they apply to specific settings 
of the shipbuilding process. 


Future research endeavours include extending this 
framework to consider calculating the overall portfolio 
performance, optimizing resource allocation, and determining 
acceptable risk ranges per project that constrain the final 
fractions of budget allocations as well as including the 
examination of portfolio actions that balance resource 
allocations considering risks and benefits. This might trigger 
project removal decisions for those projects whose acceptable 
risk ranges violate upper or lower boundaries.
