The paper considers the pricing and allocation issues of distributing digital contents via Web and P2P
channels. Utilizing a game theoretic model, the allocation equilibrium with respect to various business goals
is examined. We find that the P2P channel is always under-utilized in an organization, and present an
incentive scheme to achieve an efficient channel configuration. Under a market structure with sequential
moves, both channels set higher price and collect higher profit. Particularly, the second mover enjoys higher
price and market share. A provider with integrated channels will charge a higher price on the Web channel
and the Web channel becomes under-utilized.

1. Introduction


With the arising phenomena of the Internet, people have
significantly changed their communication behaviors, purchasing
and entertaining habits, and information goods exchange activities,
over theWeb. Today, the Internet provides a convenient and low-cost
channel by which to distribute a wide variety of information goods.
Recently, AT&T intended to attract some of Akamai and Limelight's
customers by moving further into the content delivery space with
new partners, service offerings, and a $70 million commitment to
build out its content distribution channel [4]. Amazon also launched a
content distribution service, CloudFront, in 2008 [19]. It gives
developers and businesses an easy way to distribute contents to end
users with high data transfer speed and low latency. Content delivery
networks (CDNs), which duplicate contents over several servers to
deal with the flash crowds, are used as distribution channels to push
content closer to the end users [42]. The preliminary data shows that
the worldwide CDN revenue will be a little more than $400 million in
2008, and the worldwide video CDN revenue is expected to grow to
more than $1.4 billion by 2012 [60].


The dominant content distribution platforms are categorized as
website-based and peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing systems [64]. These
systems serve the same role of distributing contents to users. Table 1
lists popularly commercialized content distribution channels. It is
common for people to download contents through the above two
important types of content distribution channels. For example,
website-based content distribution channels, such as Akamai and
LimeLight, have been serving the market for years. Besides, the iTune

store has gained a profitable market share by providing online music
downloading, and it is predicted to have one-quarter of worldwide
music market by 2012 [2]. On the other hand, although P2P is not
traditional content distribution technology, it is increasingly used to
deliver content to end users. P2P file sharing networks, such as
BitTorrent and KaZaA, are very popular and attract a great amount of
usage [29]. For example, Warner Brothers sells and distributes movies
and TV programs through BitTorrent [28]. According to file sharing
research firm BigChampagne, despite the lawsuit against developers
and consumers, P2P activity continued to rise throughout 2005,
hitting record levels in December [5]. Besides, channel providers, Grid
Networks and Rawflow, utilize P2P technologies to meet the service
requirements of digital content distribution. There are also a few
content distribution providers combing both website and P2P
channels. For example, CDNetworks and Internap Network Services
provide integrated distribution channels to serve the market. The
evolution pattern of content distribution industry reveals that these
two types of distribution platform coexist in the market and compete
for the users. Some of the existing providers in the industry even
moved between website and P2P distribution models. For instance,
Joost was an Internet TV service created by the founders of Skype and
KaZaA. During 2007–2008, it used P2P TV technology to distribute
content. However, in December 2008, Joost announced that its service
wasmoving to a website-only model and the P2P application will stop
working [61].


From the viewpoint of channel providers, a centralized website
channel provides several advantages such as easy central organizing
and managing to content providers. However, when an abundant
number of people simultaneously crowd on line, it inevitably leads to
website overload and causes an Internet traffic jam. According to Zona
Research, the amount of time taken for web pages to load is one of the

most critical factors in determining the success of a site and the
satisfaction of its users [8]. Many researchers have developed new
technologies to solve this critical issue [23,65]. Contrary to a website
channel, a P2P channel provides a more scalable distribution
infrastructure via the pooling of bandwidth, storage, and computing
resource of the peer nodes. However, P2P networks are often
considered to be security threats for organizations, companies or
plain users [68]. While there are several advantages, P2P networks are
being seriously challenged over their insufficient security design
[17,69]. Therefore, users who are choosing a preferable channel to
download the contents should take into account the abovementioned
characteristics of technological differentiation and the corresponding
benefits and drawbacks of these two channels. As integrated channels
would have the maximum optimal profits [40], the design of multi-
channel marketing strategies is gaining the attention [37].


Extensive works have been conducted on the technological design
and improvement of content distributionbased on these twoplatforms
[48–50,57]. However, little attention has been given to the business
strategy development of content distribution channels (retailers)
utilizing these heterogeneous distribution platforms and the discus-
sions of integrated channels are relatively rare in the past literatures. In
particular, how market interactions and technological parameters
affect the business strategies of these two channels have not been
systematically analyzed yet. Considering various market structures,
this paper concentrates on the economic analysis of the coexisting
content distribution channels and examines corresponding pricing and
allocation strategies aswell as technology investment in relation to the
objectives of an organization: efficiency and profitability.


Utilizing a game theoretic model, we first examine the self-
selected equilibrium of the channel allocation and propose a pricing
scheme to enforce an efficient allocation configuration within an
organization. The pricing scheme shows that the Web channel should
be charged more, in order to recover the efficiency loss due to the
over-allocation phenomenon. We further investigate pricing strate-
gies of these two distribution channels in a competitive market. We
find that the equilibrium pricing decision and allocation are quite
sensitive to the decision sequence of the channel providers. A business
environment with sequential decision structure will elevate the prices
and profits of both channels. The leader channel loses market share
because of charging a higher price, while the follower channel has the
second mover advantage to both raise its price and enjoy higher
demand. When both channels are integrated, the monopoly sets the
price of a Web channel higher than a P2P channel's price and a Web
channel becomes under-utilized.


This paper makes several significant contributions to supplement
the research literatures of content distribution. First, it appropriately
presents a model linking both main technological and economic
characteristics of the Web and P2P content distribution channels.
Second, it offers a new theoretical lens for studying the economic
issues (incentive, pricing, and investment) about digital content
distribution over heterogeneous channels. Third, it develops a new
practical framework for the analysis of content distribution business
models for the organizations with various business goals (profitability

and efficiency). Fourth, we analyze the impact of market dimension
and interactions, such as the order of the entrance to the market on
the development of business strategy and resulting profitability. And
Fifth, it lays the groundwork for developing a management tool based
on key system parameters (characteristics of network environment,
such as market size, upload capacity, and security technology) to
support strategic decision-making.


The remaining sections are organized as follows. Section 2 lists
previous literatures related to digital content distribution. Section 3
introduces the model setting. In Section 4, we examine the channel
allocation and pricing scheme in an organization. We analyze the
competition and integration of channels in the market in Section 5. In
Section 6,wediscuss the impact ofmarket size and channel interactions,
as well as IT investment under various business situations. Section 7
concludes our findings, presents managerial implication, and discusses
future research directions.

2.1. Digital content distribution


Digital content distribution on the Internet uses many different
service architectures, ranging from centralized client/server platforms
to fully distributed P2P systems. It is still in an early stage of
development and its future evolution remains an open issue, and
pricing content distribution channels is a relatively new and
unexplored research area. Commercial distribution websites of digital
content tend to provide high data quality and improve transfer
security for their clients in order to increase their profit and popularity
[55], and they generally charge customers according to their traffic.
Web content distribution mechanisms typically require vast invest-
ments of infrastructure [33]. In contrast, the P2P paradigm appears as
an attractive alternative mechanism for large scale content distribu-
tion. With the superior scalable content distribution characteristic,
P2P networks have become increasingly popular distribution chan-
nels, and the issues of supplier risks and business opportunities
arising from the P2P service model have been analyzed [38]. P2P
networks possess some nonfunctional characteristics, such as provi-
sions for security, fairness, increased scalability, resource manage-
ment, and organization capabilities [3]. Several researches have
focused on comparing technological and managerial characteristics
of both client/server and P2P channels and investigating the dramatic
differentiation of content distribution [26,39].


2.2. Economic issues in content distribution


The economic aspects of the digital content distribution channels
are closely related to the study of content distributionmodel, network
pricing, incentive mechanism, as well as content and channel
management. A few studies discuss the technological and economic
characteristics of emerging P2P and traditional client/server distribu-
tion networks. For example, several researches have plunged into
analyzing content distribution subjects related to the Web [7,52], and
congestion is one of the key quality factors for developing the pricing
strategy of Web-based content distribution services [43,46,47].
Priority pricing is also proposed for delay sensitive users as an online
adaptive resource scheduling mechanism for managing real-time
information serviceswithin organizations [35]. In addition, the issue of
budgetary balance was also examined and it was suggested that net-
valuemaximization entails a budget deficit for the service facility [18].
Pricing schemes and incentive mechanisms are highly ranked in the
realization of commercial P2P content distribution [62].While Napster
developed aworking servicemodel, it failed to adequately address two
important economic constraints: pricing and participation incentives.
This prevented their business model from being economically viable
[29]. Free-riding phenomenon is an inherent problem due to the

decentralized structure of P2P file sharing networks. Incentive
mechanism design for inducing appropriate file sharing is a promising
research topic and a number of works have been conducted on this
issue [24,41]. Regarding digital channel management in the industry
level, economic characteristics like pricing and QoS are included into
the discussion of content distribution [27], and researches have been
presented to discuss the economic related issues [39,66]. While the
QoS canbe interpreted in a different context, in general, onedimension
of differentiation is evaluated.


The content providers face the question whether to adopt a
centralized or a decentralized solution. The centralized approach is
usually mentioned as a client/server system [10], while the decentra-
lized system is implemented over a P2P network [56]. In this research,
wemodel thequality differentiationbetween twoheterogeneousdigital
channels (Web and P2P channels) from two salient perspectives—
download delay and download security.


2.3. Multiple channel competition


There has been a number of literatures focused on the business
strategy of multiple channels, including channel conflict and
coordination [11], service competition [20,34], and channel distribu-
tion [9,36]. Since the availability of multiple channels has significant
implications for the performance of consumer markets, distribution
channels have been viewed as a strategic tool and channel design has
been recognized as a key successful factor to competition [2,6]. Under
this circumstance, many suppliers face a decision of whether to add a
new channel to their existing channels. For example, whether to
adopt a dual-channel with a retailer and an outlet store [16]. Channel
competition also commonly occurs in a competing market. For
example, Choi [14] compares Stackelberg and vertical Nash game
settings in a duopolistic market. McGuire and Staelin [45] explain why
a supplier uses an intermediary retailer. On the other hand, channel
coordination can yield more profits to retailers, thus, channel conflict
can be reduced [12]. Guardiola et al. [25] analyze supply chains by
means of cooperative games.


Whilemany channel competition issues in various business contexts
have been studied, the competitive and cooperative interactions
between content distribution channels utilizing heterogeneous tech-
nological platforms have not been systematically analyzed yet. Previous
literature either studies the efficient allocation or pricing problem
within the same type of distribution channels. This research aims to
show the channel competitive interaction between the centralized
client–server structure and the decentralized P2P networks. The main
objective of this paper differs by attempting to compare the allocation,
pricing dynamics, and technology investment in website and P2P
distribution channels under variousmarket structures and organization
missions.


3. The model


We consider a digital supply chain in which consumers (or
employees in an organization) can download the digital content (or
information good) from two heterogeneous distribution channels: a
dedicated website (Web channel) or a peer-to-peer network (P2P-
channel). The parameters used in the model are listed in Table 2.
Denote N as the potential market size; η1 and η2 are the total number
of the Web channel customers and the P2P-channel customers
respectively. The number of customers outside both channels is
denoted as η3; that is, N=η1+η2+η3. The capacity (bandwidth) of
the Web channel is b1 bytes per second and average bandwidth of a
typical peer node in the P2P networks is b2 bytes per second. In
practice, we assume that the Web channel has higher capacity than
peer nodes participating in the P2P-channel (b1Nb2). For the sake of
analytical convenience, the size of a typical content file is assumed to
be f bytes.

3.1. Customer utility functions


In the model, we assume that a customer downloads a file and the
digital contents downloaded from either channel are homogeneous.
Multiple files can be viewed as a larger single file with the same size as
the summation of the sizes of these smaller files. The waiting time of
content download is assumed to be linear on the content size and also
a linear function of the number of files with identical sizes [15].
However, customers face different opportunity costs (delay and
security risk), depending on the channel chosen. A typical customer i
faces heterogeneous sharing cost (security risk) θiδ if he/she down-
loads files through the P2P-channel, where the variable θi stands for
the individual sensitivity on the sharing cost, and is uniformly
distributed with an interval [0,1]. A customer with higher value of θi
is more sensitive to this disutility. Parameter δ reflects the service
quality level (i.e. security level) of a P2P channel. A higher value of δ
indicates that a higher security risk may occur in file sharing activity.
Notice that while there should be security risk from using the Web
channel, the risk is significantly lower than that in a P2P channel
because of centralized management and the identifiable business
reputation. For analytical convenience, we normalize the security cost
of the Web channel to be zero and focus on the impact of P2P security
risk. Inclusion of security cost of the Web channel only affects the
quantitative degree of the results, however, it has no significant
impact on the qualitative results.


Let βi denote customer i's valuation on the content. Empirical
evidences reveal that if a consumer has a higher valuation on the
service, he/she tends to be more concerned on service quality [13,70].
Therefore, we formulate the valuation of a downloaded content for a
typical customer i as βi=β0+βθi, where β0≥0 is basic value attached
to each customer and βθi≥0 is individual perceived values, which are
heterogeneous on the customers. p1 and p2 signify the price of content
downloaded from the Web channel and the P2P-channel, respective-
ly. Notice that the price could be zero or negative in an organization
context. Negative price implies that the organization encourage users
to use some specific type of content distribution channel by providing
a reward mechanism. The utility of each customer with θi is defined
by:


Ui =
βi−η1w1−p1 if download through the Web� channel
βi−w2−θiδ−p2 if download through the P2P� channel


;


�
ð1Þ

where w1=γf /b1 and w2=γf /b2 are the cost of waiting time in the
Web channel and the P2P-channel, respectively, and parameter γ is
the value of time. The delay cost function η1w1 considers the
congestion externality faced by the customers of client/server based
Web channel in which delay linearly increases with the number of the
users as all the users are served by a dedicated server at the same time
[30]. Notice that the forms of convex delay function on the demand
pose no conceptual difficulty, but make the analysis less tractable
because of the complexity in expressing the closed-form results. They
affect the quantitative level (e.g. less Web channel users) but have no
significant impact on the qualitative results.1 Delay cost function w2
describes the scalability of the P2P-channel on the performance of
download delay as effective supply of bandwidth capacity is scalable
in relation to the demand of the download request. Since sharing cost
(security risk) is an important factor in deciding whether to choose a
P2P network as the distribution channel, we also assume that δNw2 to
reflect that the security concern is significantly important relative to
the file transfer performance between two peer nodes.


3.2. Channel demand functions


According to the content valuation function βi, the Web channel is
more preferable to the users who have a higher valuation on the
content. Let θ̂1 denote a customer type who is indifferent between
buying (and downloading) from a P2P channel and not buying.
Similarly, let θ̂2 denote a customer type who is indifferent between
purchasing from a Web channel and a P2P channel. The utility
function implies that:


θ̂1 =
w2 + p2−β0

value of θ̂2 reveals that the website channel can increase its market
share by increasing its bandwidth capacity b1 since it reduces the
expected delay, whereas the P2P channel can increase its market
share by reducing δ to improve the sharing security. As the bandwidth
capacity of end users increase (such as adopting broadband
connection), the market share of the P2P channel will also increase.
Consequently, according to the conditions:

4. Channels in the organization


With the development of digital device technology, almost all
kinds of information can be stored in digital format. In addition,
Internet and Web technology significantly diminish the cost of
distributing the contents. We consider an organization in which
both website and P2P channels are installed for software or digital
content distribution. For example, while still maintaining the software

download website, Microsoft also starts testing Avalanche peer-to-
peer content distribution platform to distribute beta software [51].


We first investigate the equilibrium channel allocation without
any price (or reward) scheme. Then, we compare them with the
efficiency (socially optimal) results. Finally, we discuss the incentive
mechanism that an organization could adopt to enforce an efficient
channel allocation.


4.1. Self-selection equilibrium


In the absence of any pricing schemes on the channel services
(p1=p2=0), the users self-select an appropriate channel in order to
maximize its individual utility. From Eq. (3), the resulting equilibrium
demand for each channel is given by:


ηe1 =

Proposition 1 reveals that the Web channel will dominate the P2P-
channel when the number of users is small and congestion is not a
sensitive problem. However, as more users utilize the Web channel,
congestion becomesmore serious and some of its users are switching to
the P2P-channel. As a result, the Web channel becomes less attractive
and the P2P-channel enjoys its advantage of faster file transfer, as the
total population is increasing. Notice that, although the P2P-channel
becomes more attractive, some new users with strong adversity to the
security risk choose theWeb channel; therefore, the number of theWeb
channel users continuously increases as the user population grows.
Since the increasing rate of new users is higher in relation to the P2P-

channel, themarket size of the P2P-channel will exceed that of theWeb
channel when the total population is sufficiently high.


Fig. 1 shows the evolution of allocation between two heteroge-
neous channels as the total population grows. Initially, when the
population size is quite small, the Web channel may serve all of the
users. As the population size increases, it emerges that some users
begin to use the P2P-channel and P2P file sharing activities. Because of
the congestion effect, the P2P-channel becomes more favorable than
theWeb channel as the population increases. Finally, the P2P-channel
dominates the Web channel with a greater market size.


For real cases, Internap initially provides the website-based
content delivery service to its customers. However, as the number
of users increases, the delivery performance becomes not as good as
expected. In 2007, it served its customers with a new P2P-based
delivery channel for a better service quality [71]. Besides, CDNetworks
adopted a similar strategy to better serve its customers. In the
beginning, the contents were located at dedicated websites, and the
users downloaded what they liked directly from the websites.
However, as the download congestion came with the growth of
users, the performance became intolerable and the P2P-channel was
adopted to overcome this problem.


4.2. Efficient channel allocation


In this subsection, we compare the self-selection equilibrium of
channel allocation with the efficient channel allocation. The efficiency
of channel allocation is measured by its social welfare, which is the
sum of individual utilities less the overall investment of the Web
channel's capacity and P2P security technology. In the following, we
first investigate the configuration of an efficient (or socially optimal)
channel allocation, which is the objective of a value-maximizing
organization. Denote K1(b1) as the cost function of Web channel
capacity, and K2(δ) as the cost function of P2P security technology; K1
(b1) is a linear function on bandwidth capacity b1, and K2(δ) is a
decreasingly convex function on security quality level δ. The overall
value of the organization is defined as3:


W = ∑Ni=1Ui−K1 b1ð Þ−K2 δð Þ: ð6Þ


The efficient choices of channel allocation can be found by solving
the optimization problem:

After comparing Eqs. (4) and (8), we present the following
observations:


Proposition 2. Efficient channel allocation


1. Free-access policy results in over-usage (under-usage) of the Web-
(P2P-) channel, in comparison with the efficient channel allocation
configuration.

3 If an organization include network department offering bandwidth capacity, the
overall value function should become W′=W−KN(b2), where KN(b2) is the total
bandwidth cost incurred on the network operators to offer the P2P download service
with expected capacity b2.

Proposition 2 indicates that without any intervention from the
organization, self-selection will result in an inefficient channel
allocation, even though people recognize the congestion externality.
The phenomenon of over-using congestible resources has been
previously identified in the context of a single server based channel.
Our results also show that a P2P channel could play a role in
improving organization efficiency only if the users of an organization
are of sufficiently large numbers, even though some users have better
utility in using a P2P-channel. Fig. 2 shows that equilibrium market
share (in percentage) of a Web channel decreases as the population
size increases; however, the level of self-selection is still higher than
the efficiency level.


In practice, Internap improves its content distribution efficiency by
a “best-of-both-worlds” combination [31]. When content download
delay is below an acceptable threshold, peers become unavailable or
drop off unexpectedly and all the contents are seamlessly downloaded
from the Web channel. This architecture enables the users to gain
potential benefits from P2P distributionwhilemaintaining an efficient
distribution performance.

4.3. Efficient pricing scheme


In order to recover the efficiency loss due to over (under)-usage of
the Web- (P2P-) channel, an organization can develop appropriate
discouraging (charging the Web channel users) or encouraging
(rewarding the P2P-channel users) mechanism to enforce an efficient
channel allocation. The efficient (socially optimal) pricing scheme
should satisfy the following condition:


N w2 + δð Þ

� �

; ð9Þ


or


▵p
w = pw1 −p


w
2 =


Nw1 w2 + δð Þ
2Nw1 + δ


: ð10Þ


There are many ways to develop a pricing (rewarding) scheme
when all users in an organization use the channels (β0≥w2). In
practice, for example, while keeping the P2P channel free-access, an
organization may charge the Web channel users a price:p1


w=Δpw.
Alternatively, an organization could adopt an encouragingmechanism
which rewards P2P users with p2


w=−Δpw but let the Web channel
downloads free of charge. Or, an organization may charge a Web
channel a higher price than it would a P2P channel. However, p2


w must
be zero when the organization are partially served (β0≤w2), which
can be observed from Eq. (8).

It is interesting to analyze the impact of system parameters on the
resultant pricing scheme. Assume y is a system parameter and S=
{N,δ,b1,b2, f } is the set of system parameters. Observing Eq. (10), we
can easily verify that ∂Δpw /∂yN0, for y∈{N,δ, f} and ∂Δpw /∂yb0, for
y∈{b1,b2}.


Proposition 3. Efficient pricing scheme


1. An organization shall charge users a higher price for using the Web
channel. Specifically, content distribution in an organization with two
heterogeneous channels is efficient if their price levels are satisfactory
(Eq. (10)).


2. Price disperse level of the Web- and P2P-channels increases with
potential market size and file size, but decreases with P2P security
quality and the capacities of both Web server and P2P users.


The intuition of Proposition 3 can be explained as follows. As the
population size grows, the Web channel faces more serious
congestion from new users. In order to inhibit the efficiency loss
from congestion, a high price strategy is essential to discourage the
Web channel usage. As higher sharing cost in a P2P channel forces
more users of the P2P-channel to switch to the Web channel, an
organization will charge the users of the Web channel a higher price
to discourage its usage. Similarly, when the performance of P2P file
transfer is improved (larger peer capacity), fewer users will use the
Web channel and the price will decline. Similarly, higher capacity for
the Web channel can alleviate congestion externality and the price
will naturally go down. Finally, while larger file size (for example,
multimedia game or movie) increases download delay in both
channels, the effect is more significant in a Web channel because of
congestion externality. Consequently, the price rises.

5. Channels in the market


In this section, we examine the pricing schemes of content distribution channels operated by profit-seeking firms. For example, iTune
provides a website-based channel to sell licensed digital music, while Snocap uses a system of sound fingerprinting which allows songs traded
over a P2P network. In contrast, CoopNet integrates both website and peer-to-peer channels for content distribution [53,54]. We first investigate
pricing competition between these two channels owned or operated by independent firms, and then we analyze the pricing strategy and
profitability when both channels are integrated. Notice that in the research, the channels in themarket are actually the retailers utilizing different
technological distribution platforms. Therefore, the channels should pay their content sales to the content owners. While there exist various
types of business contract for content owners to collect revenue from the retailing channels, revenue sharing is the most popularly used one in
the digital content industry [1]. For example, Apple entered into a revenue sharing agreement with five of the major music labels: BMG, EMI,
Sony, Universal, and Warner. The impact of revenue sharing mechanism on the pricing schemes of distribution channels is discussed in
Appendix A.


5.1. Pricing in competing channels


The business environment for the Web- and P2P- channels is largely determined by the timing to enter the market for these two players. We
consider three cases of competition structure in non-cooperative pricing dynamics. In the first case, both channels participate simultaneously in a
Bertrand pricing competition game. The next two cases consider the business situationwherein one of them has the leadership of pricing decision
and these two channels participate in a Stackelberg (leader–follower) pricing competition game [58,63].


5.1.1. Simultaneous pricing competition
Let us first examine a simultaneous price competition between theWeb channel and the P2P-channel. Denote π1


c (π2

c (p2

function and the price of the Web- (P2P-) channel respectively. We have the following profit functions:

Firstly, for a fully served market in which all customers' content values are very high ( θ̂1b0), we can get the price response function of the
Web- (P2P-) channel to the P2P- (Web-) channel's pricing decision by solving the first order conditions, ∂π1c /∂p1c =0, and ∂π2c /∂p2c=0:

Next, for a partially servedmarket ( θ̂1 N 0), we can get another price response function of theWeb- (P2P-) channel to the P2P- (Web-) channel's
pricing decision:

For a fully served market in which customers' content values are not very high (βc0bβ0bβ
c
0), we will have other different price response


functions. βc0 and β
c
0 are the values of β0 derived from the equation θ̂1 = 0 by using p2


c given by Eqs. (14) and (17), respectively. In this case,
solving θ̂1 = 0 yields P2P-channel's equilibrium price. Notice that the price response function of the Web channel to the P2P-channel's pricing


decision in Eq. (13) is the same as that in Eq. (15). As a result, the Web channel's equilibrium price can be obtained from pc1 =
δ + w2 + pc2

directly.


Finally, the equilibrium price levels under different scenarios can be expressed as follows.

5.1.2. Sequential pricing competition: Web channel as the leader
Suppose theWeb channel makes the pricing decision before the P2P-channel does. Firstly, for the case θ̂1b0, the P2P-channel makes a pricing


decision after observing the decision of the Web channel. Thus, the best response function of the P2P-channel to the Web channel is the same as
that developed from the case of simultaneous decision, i.e. p2


c12=(Nw1−w2+p1c12) /2. Utilizing a backward induction approach, the profit
function of the Web channel is obtained by plugging in the P2P-channel's response function p1


c12, and rewritten as:

c12

decision after the Web channel does and whether the market is fully served by both channels completely depends on p2
c12, we know when β0 is


small (βc120 ≤ β0≤ β
�
0), the Web channel has to tactfully set its price based on p2


c12=(Nw1−w2+p1c12) /2 to ensure that the P2P-channel sets
p2
c12=β0−w2. However, when β0 becomes larger (β�0≤ β0bβ


c12
0 ), theWeb channel can set its price directly according to its best response function


to the P2P-channel p1
c=(δ+w2+p2


c)/2.

5.1.4. Analysis of system and competition effects
We first we examine the effects of system parameters (e.g. security quality and download capacity) on the equilibrium price, demand, and


revenue levels. Then, we analyze the impact of competition structure on the equilibrium results.


5.1.4.1. Analysis of system effect. Examining the resulting price and profit levels in various system parameter settings, we derive the following
interesting observations.


Proposition 4. Effect of system parameter in competing channels
1. When the market is fully (partially) served, both price and profit levels of the Web and P2P channels always increase (may decrease) as the P2P


channel provides poorer quality of P2P security and/or the Web channel installs smaller sever capacity.
2. However, the impact of capacity of peer nodes on the two channels are opposite: higher speed of P2P file transfer will increase price and profit levels of


the P2P channel service but decrease price and profit levels of the Web channel service.






251Y.-M. Li / Decision Support Systems 50 (2010) 243–257

Proposition 4 reveals an interesting phenomenon: when the demand is so strong such that the market is fully served ( θ̂1b0), competing
channels have little incentive in improving their service quality. The driver of this occurrence can be explained as follows. As one of the
competing channels offers worse service (P2P security quality or website capacity), the other channel will set a higher price in order to make a
higher profit. Accordingly, calculating that one's opponent will also adopt a higher price strategy, a channel raises its price as well. As a result, the
revenue levels of both channels increase.


The intuition of Part 2 of Proposition 4 works as follows. In the model, as the users are assumed to have homogeneous sensitivity on the
download delay, the P2P channel always benefits from faster file transfer and sets a higher price, while the Web channel needs to cut its price to
avoid losing customers. It is noteworthy that the divergent implications of Web and P2P capacities are mainly due to the distinguishing
characteristic of a congestible Web channel and a scalable P2P channel. As the P2P channel benefits from faster P2P file transfer but not higher
quality of P2P security technology; instead of developing advanced file sharing security technology, it is suggested that the P2P channel develop
appropriate incentive mechanisms to induce peer nodes to contribute larger bandwidth capacity.


If the market is partially served ( θ̂1b0), our numerical simulations reveal that better QoS (ie. higherWebsite capacity and better P2P security)
still always results in lower price levels in both channels but the effect of QoS on revenue levels may be positive or negative. As the QoS of either
channel is improved, both channels will cut its price and the demands of both channel increase. Fig. 3 demonstrates the negative effect of QoS on
the price and Fig. 4 illustrates that the impact of QoS on the revenue of a channel is positive (negative) when the individual perceived values of
content download are high (low) and could be non-monotonic. From another perspective, we can conclude that if QoS becomes lower, the service
quality and price effects will force the demand to shrink (from a fully servedmarket to become a partially servedmarket) and the revenues of the
channels are eventually reduced if the content value is not very high.


For a long time, Akamai holds market dominance in the content distribution industry. It charged a lot of money for delivering bits more
reliably. However, with the emergence of competitors (such as Limelight), Akamai provides content delivery service with better quality but
charges a lower price [21,44].


5.1.4.2. Analysis of competition effect. Comparing the results under various competition structures, we summarize a few interesting findings as
shown in Table 3.


Proposition 5. Effect of competition structure
1. Compared to the results of simultaneous price competition, both channels set a higher price and collect a higher profit under sequential competition.
2. Compared to the results of simultaneous price competition, the demand of the leader channel decreases, whereas the demand of the follower channel


increases.
3. A channel sets a higher price and makes less profit when it is the leader rather than the follower, under sequential competition.


What we have discovered from the equilibrium results is that both competing channels benefit from a market with sequential decisions, and
being the second mover has superior advantages. The intuition concerning the results (Proposition 5) is described as follows. When the leader
channel sets its price in the first period, it predicts that the follower channel will slightly undercut its price in order to obtain a larger demand. The
predictionputs pressure on the leader channel tomaintain a highprice in order to avoid having the follower channel set a very lowdemand.Hence,
both channels set prices higher than the price level of simultaneous price competition. As a result, both channels make higher profits from setting
higher prices. We can also observe that compared to price levels of simultaneous competition, the increase in price to the leader channel is larger
than the increase in price to the follower channel. That causes the demand of the leader channel to decrease, whereas the demand of the follower
channel increases. Since the follower channel can set a slightly lower price than the leader channel to enlarge its demand, it makes higher profit
than it does from being a leader. Therefore, both competing channels prefer sequential price competition and wish its opponent to be the first
mover. That is, the second mover advantage phenomenon occurs under the scenario of sequential price competition.


Research had asserted that Internet first mover advantages do exist, but companies seemed to overestimate their importance [59]. From the
evolution patterns of content distribution evolution, for example, although the Web channel like Internap (1996) and Akamai (1998) was the first
mover, RawFlow(P2P-channel)was introduced in 2002. On theother hand, the P2P channel does not dominate themarket as a followerWebchannel
like BitGravity (2006) sequentially emerged. This indicates that the potential follower advantages can still be recognized and exploited.


5.2. Pricing in collaborating channels


These two channels may collaborate (or be integrated) as a single channel provider or form a strategic alliance to maximize joint profit. For
example, advanced content distribution systems, such as DOH [32] and CoralCDN [22], have been developed to provide such integrated channels.

VELOCIX provides Velocix software services to deliver contents via both Web and P2P channels [67]. Because the channels are collaboratively
operated, price decisions of these two channels are simultaneously made by the joint unit. Notice that some revenue sharing contract between
two channels should be applied if they are still independent business units but jointly operated. If the two channels belong to the same company
and all the revenues are received by the monopolistic company. Thus, the profit maximization problem is formulated as:

Examining Eq. (30), we have the following findings:


Proposition 6. Collaborating channels
1. The price level of the Web channel is always higher than that of the P2P-channel.
2. Collaborating pricing will result in under-usage in the Web channel.


The intuition of Proposition 6.1 is the integrated providers can improve revenue by reducing the delay in Web channel which is a main
disutility for download service. The integrated providers can set a higher price for Web channel service so as to improve delay performance.
However, the price is increased highly and results in inefficient (under-utilized) Web channel allocation. The price offset between the two
channels: Δpm=p1


m−p2m=(δ+w2)/2, indicates that the integrated firm sets a higher price level for theWeb channel. Since ΔpmNΔpw, the price
level of the Web channel is still too high, compared to the efficiency price level. As a result, contrast to the result derived from free-access policy,
the problem of under-usage in the Web channel occurs when two channels are priced by an integrated firm.

be the efficient price disperse level. ΔpbΔpw (ΔpNΔpw) indicates that

channel uses is larger (smaller) than the efficient one. Fig. 5 shows
that the efficient price disperse level is always positive and increases
with the number of users. It reveals that free-access always results in

over-usage of a Web channel and congestion becomes intensified as
the number of users increases; consequently, a higher price should be
charged on the Web channel users to recover the efficiency loss. In an
integratedmarket, the price level of theWeb channel is always higher
than that of the P2P-channel, which indicates under-usage in theWeb
channel. However, their difference is irrelevant to the market size. For
two competing providers, the price of the Web channel is higher only
when the market size is small. As the market grows, the P2P-channel
may charge a higher price. Notice that for simplicity, the competition
case in Fig. 5 was depicted based on simultaneous competition. The
numerical results for the cases of sequential moves are similar. From
the perspective of efficiency, when the market is small, the Web
channel is under-utilized. As the market size keeps growing, the Web
channel become over-utilized.


Fig. 6 shows the equilibrium market share (in percentage) of the
Web channel with respect to various competition structures. The
second mover advantage in obtaining higher market share is verified.
From the perspective of economic efficiency, the Web channel as the
first (second) mover is superb when the number of users is large
(small). That is, a competition structure with sequential moves is
better than one with simultaneous decision structure when the
number of users is sufficiently small or large.


6.2. Investment of P2P security technology and website capacity


An organization can make appropriate investment in developing
advanced P2P security technology or in installing high website
capacity to improve its efficiency or profitability. In this subsection,
we examine the impact of market competition on the selection of
information technology investment (e.g. P2P security level and

Website capacity). Of course, the service quality to be offered to the
customers (users) is determined by these infrastructure investments.
As described above, the cost of website capacity is a linear function on
the capacity with properties:∂K1(b1)/∂b1N0, ∂2K1(b1) /∂b12=0, and
K1(0)=0; the cost of P2P security technology investment is a
decreasingly convex function on capacity with properties: ∂K2(δ)/
∂δb0, ∂K2(δ) /∂δ≥0, and K2(0)=∞. We denote δm (δc) as the optimal
P2P security level of the collaborating (competing) channels and δw as
the efficient P2P security level that maximizes the overall value of the
organization. b1


m(b1
c) is the optimal capacity of the Web channel in


collaborating (competing) channels and b1
w the efficient capacity of


the Web channel.


Proposition 7. IT investment in a fully served market


1. A P2P-channel under-invests its P2P security technology. Formally,
δwbδm=δc.


2. The Web capacity in collaborating channels is higher than that in
the competing channels (b1


mNb1
c).


The intuition of Proposition 7 can be interpreted as follows. As in a
fully served competing market, improving P2P security quality and
Web capacity only deteriorates the profit levels of both competing
channels (Proposition 4), a P2P-channel (Web channel) will choose
the quality level of security technology (bandwidth capacity level) as
low as possible. Consequently, a P2P-channel under-invests its P2P
security technology and theWeb capacity in collaborating channels is
higher than that in the competing channels. Notice that compared to
the efficient level, Web capacity in a competing or collaborating
channel may be higher or lower, depending on the relative security
cost. As discussed in Proposition 4, when the market is partially
served, the channels' revenues may increase or decrease with the QoS
levels. Therefore, the Web channel capacity in a competing setting
could be higher or lower than that in the collaborating setting.


7. Concluding remarks


Website and P2P networks are two important channels for
distributing digital content and information well. In this paper, we
have developed economic (game theoretic) models to investigate the
allocation and pricing schemes of these two channels under the
business environment of an organization and duopolistic markets.


7.1. Summary of findings


Our analytical results show that it will be efficient to direct more
users to use the P2P channel in the absence of any pricing scheme. In
order to enforce an efficient configuration of channel allocation, a
service fee on theWeb channel is suggested. In duopolistic markets in
which channels are operated by independent firms, the equilibrium
pricing decisions and resulting demand distributions are significantly
associated to the decision sequence of both channels. Both channels in
a competition structure with sequential decision will obtain higher
profit. The price levels of both channels rise; however, the channel
with leadership in pricing decision obtains less market share than
does the follower channel. In duopolistic markets, a Web channel may
charge a higher or lower price level than a P2P-channel, depending on
the business environment. If these two channels are integrated into a
firm, the price of a Web channel will always be higher than that of a
P2P channel. However, the price is too high, so the channel allocation
is still inefficient due to under-usage of the Web channel. In addition,
we find the effect of system parameters (such as P2P security quality
and Web channel's capacity) on the revenues of two competing
channelsmay be positive or negative, depending onwhether amarket
is partially or fully served.


In Table 4, we summarize the impact of the business situation
(value-maximizing organization or profit-seeking firms in various

7.2. Managerial and policy implications


Our analytical results provide a few useful insights for developing
business strategy and operations policy in content distribution. For
the efficiency-seeking organizations, because the Web channel tends
to be over-used, the organizations may discourage or limit the usage
of the Web channel. For example, only the high secret or light digital
content can be downloaded from the Web channel, whereas general
documents or heavy content should be retrieved from the P2P-
channel. As we analyzed, the number of users is a critical factor that
determines whether an organization should adopt a P2P channel or
not. When the number of users in an organization is small, offering
only the Web channel is a better policy for content distribution. Once
the number of users is beyond a threshold, an organization may
seriously consider installing a P2P-channel to alleviate the congestion
of the Web channel and improve the overall efficiency of content
distribution.


For the channel providers in a competing market, because of the
competition pressure, they should recognize the customers' valuation
on content service in order to correctly estimate the demand, develop
the appropriate pricing scheme, and rightly adjust their investment
strategy. When the content is essential to the customers and the
demand is very strong, they should consider a low service quality
strategy to save the infrastructure investment cost. However, if the
demand is weak, they may consider adopting a high service quality
strategy to attract more customers. In addition, because of inherent
disadvantage of the first mover in price competition, the channel
providers should try to be the follower and carefully observe their
opponents' moves before making a price decision.

For a provider with integrated channels, the best pricing strategy is
to segment the market by charging a higher price on theWeb channel
and a lower price on the P2P-channel. In this way, the customers with
higher (lower) valuation on the content are willing to purchase the
content from the Web channel (P2P-channel). In addition, if the
provider wishes to reduce the price disperse between two channels, a
critical way is to improve the P2P security quality.


7.3. Limitation and directions for future study


In our model, we assume that the content achieved from two
channels is identical, while the valuation of the content is heteroge-
neous for all customers. For the sake of analysis, the valuation function
of content is assumed to be positively associated with the P2P security
quality. The correlation between service valuation and other dimen-
sions of QoS could be further investigated. In addition, the
heterogeneity of two channels is mainly differentiated based on the
delay and security risk. Investigating the corresponding pricing
strategies under other heterogeneous setting is a desirable future
extension. In the research, we only consider the competition between
two pure heterogeneous channels. However, the players in compet-
itive market may include providers offering integrated channels.
Besides the investigation of competition and integration between
horizontal firms (channels), an interesting direction for future
research is to study the business environment in which multiple
content providers (owners) and channel providers participate in
competition and integration games in vertical as well as horizontal
dimensions. The impact of various types of business contract among
these players on business strategy development is a promising
research issue. Another venue is to analyze the pricing and channel
allocation from a dynamic perspective, in which the time factor
should be carefully considered. In the research, we do not examine the
participation issues of a P2P channel. Free-riding problem and
bandwidth capacity fluctuation will make the P2P channel less
preferable. Therefore, how to develop appropriate incentive mechan-
isms is an important issue. Finally, as the results are mainly explored
based on analytical models, further relevant empirical studies on the
digital contribution channels are helpful for the validation of the
analytical findings.

A8. The impact of convexity of delay function


We use a general convex form of the delay function to show that over-utilization of the Web channel always occurs. Firstly, we denote the
delay function as η1


αw1, where α≥1. The demand of the Web channel becomes η1 = 1−
ηα

users in self-selection equilibrium is given by solving equation

� �

As expected, convexity of delay function will result in less demand of the Web channel (i.e. η1
e(a=1)Nη1


e(aN1)).

Next, the efficient allocation configuration of the channels can be obtained by solving the following objective function.

δ + N α + 1ð Þ ηw1

ηw1 = w2 + δð ÞN ðA2Þ


Comparing Eq. (A1) with Eq. (A2), we can observe that η1
e Nη1


w always holds as long as αN0. That is over-utilization in the Web channel that
always occurs whenever congestion externality exists in the Web channel. When the delay is more convex on the demand, both η1


e and η1
w


become smaller, but η1
e Nη1


w always holds.


A9. Revenue sharing mechanism


Assume the revenue sharing rate (the percentage of revenue to be transferred from content retailers to a content owner) for theWeb channel
and the P2P channel are φ1 and φ2 respectively. φ1 and φ2 are determined by the relative bargaining power between the content owners and
channel providers.


For competing channels, the profit of these two competing channel providers becomes

If the content owner is monopolistic and has dominant bargaining power, then φi

a single revenue sharing rate is adopted, we can obtain the rate as φcm
