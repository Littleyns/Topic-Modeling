Abstract 


Predictive maintenance (PdM) has been widely used in manufacturing to reduce maintenance cost and unexpected downtime. A common element 


within manufacturing equipment/machines is a motor. This paper aims to detect motor faults by collecting and analyzing vibration data with 


wireless sensors. A cloud-based motor condition monitoring system is also built to detect motor faults by analyzing the data. An Artificial 


Intelligence (AI) model is trained using the collected vibration data, and principal component analysis (PCA) is utilized to detect abnormal 


behaviors of the motor. Hostelling’s T2 statistics and squared prediction error (SPE) statistics are then applied to clarify criterions for abnormal 


operations of the motor.

1. Introduction 


Recently, the Internet of things (IoT) has accelerated the 


transformation of manufacturing industries from the 


conventional manufacturing system to smart and sustainable 


manufacturing. The advantages of smart manufacturing, such 


as reduced manufacturing costs and improved productivity, 


have attracted more and more manufacturers’ attention to 


adopting it. With the innovative development of wireless 


sensors in higher availability and affordability, data acquisition 


and accessibility in cloud-based computing networks inspired 


manufacturers to move toward the highly interconnected 


manufacturing systems [1]. As a part of this change, a new 


production paradigm is offered where the cloud-based 


technologies play a vital role in the existing manufacturing 


industry. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is widely utilized in the 


manufacturing industry, that has an incredible impact on data 


characterization and prediction. As a subset of AI, machine 


learning (e.g., supervised learning and unsupervised learning) 


is one of the commonly used methods in machine condition 


diagnostics (e.g., predictive maintenance, prognostics, and 


health management). The application of machine learning in 


machine diagnostics can effectively predict the failure or 


abnormality of the machine in advance and further reduce 


maintenance costs and unexpected downtime.  


Machine diagnostics can provide predictive maintenance 


solutions to a range of industries and have been broadly studied 


based on machine learning. To diagnose machine conditions, 


related data is often to be collected and analyzed. Currently, 


various types of data have been used for failure analysis such 


as acoustic data [2, 3, 4], acceleration data [5, 6, 7], infrared 


images [8, 9], and multi-sensor data fusion [10, 11, 12]. In a 


motor, each rotating component generates its own distinctive 


vibration pattern that can provide an explicit basis for the 


machine condition [13]. Hence, in condition-based 


maintenance of a motor, vibration monitoring and analysis are 


essential to the machine condition diagnostics. In addition, 


vibration analysis can provide imperative sensitivity and 


accuracy [14]. Therefore, the acceleration data is collected and 


analyzed in this study for abnormality detection of a motor.

This work is built upon the collaboration with company 


partners where vibration sensors are deployed on the motors. A 


cloud-based motor condition monitoring system is then 


implemented where AI algorithm is trained with the collected 


data and principal component analysis (PCA), which refers an 


unsupervised learning method that can reduce the dimension of 


input data space for a reconfiguration of a data model, is 


utilized to detect the abnormality of the motor. The remaining 


sections of this paper are organized as follows. Section 2 


describes the overall sensor networks for data acquisition and 


analysis using AI techniques for machine diagnosis. Section 3 


presents the acceleration data and explains the concepts used 


for the feature extraction process from the data. Section 4 


demonstrates Hotelling’s T2 and SPE statistics with the 


visualization of data to clarify abnormal operations of the 


motor. 


2. A cloud-based motor condition monitoring system 


In this work, continuously real-time observations on motors 


in manufacturing plants are conducted by developing an 


application of a cloud-based motor condition monitoring 


system. The overview of the system is shown in Fig. 1. In this 


system, tri-axial wireless vibration sensors are attached to the 


motors to measure acceleration data in 3-dimensional 


directions. Then, the measured data are transmitted to a sensor 


gateway via Bluetooth channel that can guarantee a stable 


connection in a short distance range. The sensor gateway is 


then connected to Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) with 


IEEE 802.11 standards. Finally, the sampled data are collected 


and recorded in the cloud server that is accessible and visible 


online. 


The feature extraction process and parameter manipulation 


are conducted for training an AI model. The model utilized in 


this work is trained to learn the data without pre-existing labels. 


The trained model then can detect the previously unknown 


abnormal patterns of the motors. Therefore, the outcomes of 


this system can provide machine diagnostics for the 


manufacturers to further optimize their maintenance plan. The 


verification of the AI model can be achieved by comparing data 


with the actual behavior of the observed motors. The 


explanation of the detailed procedure will be demonstrated in 


the following sections. 


3. Principal component analysis of acceleration data  


Raw acceleration signals are plotted using MATLAB and 


shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2(a) shows the average and peak to peak 


acceleration value of each axis. Fig. 2(b) illustrates acceleration 


signals which a noise reduction technique is applied following 


normalization with zero mean and unit variance. 6 features (i.e., 


root mean square and range of each axis) are selected and 


generated with different central tendencies and dispersions. 


PCA is then applied to coordinate multi-dimensional dataset to 


new axes in a reduced dimension. The principal components 


(PCs) are generated from the feature datasets, while the 


interdependency between variables is minimized. 


Simultaneously, the most variation of the dataset is preserved 


to make it easier to distinguish abnormal data. During the 


training process, sample data under normal operating 


conditions are used and the covariance matrix of the data is 


obtained, which indicates the correlation of the training dataset. 


The PCs can then be identified after eigen decomposition of 


the covariance matrix. That is, the covariance matrix is 


decomposed into its eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The 


eigenvector of the covariance matrix, which has the largest 


variance, is called the first PC and the eigenvector with the 


second largest variance is called the second PC. Since the 


dimensions of original data are reduced, the number of PCs 


needs to be carefully selected, ensuring that the new PC domain 


conserves the information of original data. One way to 


determine the number of PCs is to use the percentage of 


explained variance, which has been routinely used in PCA. 


Explained variance indicates how far each data point in the 


dataset is from the mean. This value determines how much 


information from the existing data will be retained. The 


explained variance can be calculated by the ratio between the 


variance of the selected PCs and the variation of all PCs as 


shown in the following Eq. (1).

where λi represents i
th principal component and p, n denote 


the number of selected principal components and the number 


of all principal components, respectively. It is common to 


select the explained variance value between 70% to 95% to 


minimize loss of information due to dimension degradation of 


data [15]. In this research, two PCs are selected to ensure that 


the explained variance exceeded 90%, which indicates the PCs 


have more than 90 % associativity with the original data. The 


training data are projected on the new PC domain to obtain the 


retained PCs. The training and testing data utilized in this work 


are continuously sampled for one month and 2 weeks, 


respectively. The data are sampled at 1 data point per minute. 


In total, 43,200 sampled data and 21,600 data are utilized to 


train and test the AI model, respectively. The AI model can be 


further improved by sampling more data or sampling at a higher 


rate. 


4. Data visualization and abnormality detection 


The first and second PCs determined by the PCA are 


visualized in Fig. 3. Different colors are applied to the data 


points for each day to help identify the abnormal operation of 


a specific day. The PCA dimension reduction automatically 


realizes data clustering as is evident in Fig. 3. Similar data 


points are grouped together, and the data that have different 


properties are segregated from one another while revealing 


underlying data patterns or outliers. However, this may not 


provide a clear interpretation of the motor condition. To clarify 


this ambiguity, further data interpretation through the 


Fig. 2. (a) Raw acceleration signal plot; (b) Normalized acceleration signal plot.

Hotelling’s T2 and SPE analysis is conducted based on kernel 


density estimation (KDE), which refers to a data-driven 


technique for the non-parametric estimation of density 


functions [16]. The Hotelling’s T2 statistics is a mathematical 


procedure to estimate model interior data change so that it 


reflects the change in variables by counting the fluctuation of 


the PCs. The SPE statistics is the estimation of model exterior 


data change, and it shows the deviation of the current measured 


variable to the PCA model [17]. The Hotelling’s T2 and SPE 


statistics are expressed in the following Eq. (2) and (3) [18, 19].

P and λ is a diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues corresponding 


to the selected principal components. Ti and  


SPEi represent i
th row element of the statistic matrices. KDE is 


obtained by the following probability density function (PDF) 


as shown in Eq. (4) [17].

where x is an input feature matrix, K is a kernel function, H

distribution function is a widely-used kernel function, where an 


appropriate bandwidth matrix is chosen based on the estimated 


standard deviation of sample data. The Gaussian kernel 


function is expressed in Eq. (5).

For a given confidence level, (i.e., 95%, 99%, and 99.9% as 


the first control limit, second control limit and action limit, 


respectively), the probability of a point falling beyond the 


control limit is calculated based on the kernel function to 


indicate whether the process is “in control” or “out of control.” 


Often, the control limits for T2 and SPE control charts are 


computed using F and χ2 distributions, respectively.  This 


computation is typically performed upon the assumption that 


the original data is temporal independence and follows a 


multivariate Gaussian distribution [20]. Since such an 


assumption may not be valid for this study, the control limits 


are established using KDE. The corresponding control limits 


based on KDE is calculated using the kernel density estimator, 


as shown in Eq. (6).

where P(x) indicates the probability that a data point exceeds 


the control limit and cl is an upper bound of the control limit. 


This probability is then compared with the given confidence 


levels to provide a warning action and diagnosis of the motor 


operating condition. The SPE, which is also known as Q 


residual, and Hotelling’s T2 control limits, are illustrated in the 


control charts shown in Fig. 4. The first control limit is 


emphasized in the yellow line, and the second control limit is 


highlighted by the red line. These control charts clearly show 


the abnormal operations exceeding control limits that are 


indicated in the dotted circle. The established control limits are 


then used for machine condition monitoring in actual 


manufacturing plants. The verification of this model is 


accomplished by comparing the analysis results with the real 


operation of the motor. 


5. Conclusions 


In this work, a cloud-based motor condition monitoring 


system was implemented to detect abnormal operations of 


motors. Tri-axial vibration sensors were utilized to collect 


acceleration data. The acceleration data were recorded in the 


cloud server for sending and receiving the data. PCA technique 


was then applied for the feature extraction and analysis of the 


sampled data. In this research, two PCs were selected based on 


KDE to ensure the preservation of original information. Also, 


Hotelling’s T2 and SPE statistics were used to provide explicit 


criteria for abnormality detection. The analyzed data were then 


visualized in Hotelling’s T2 and SPE control charts. Relevant 


equations were explained to demonstrate the relationship 


between KDE and control limits of the two statistics. The

confidence levels at 95%, 99%, and 99.9% were used to 


determine the control limits and illustrated in the control charts. 


The Hotelling’s T2 and SPE control charts presented the data 


exceeding the control limits to distinguish the abnormal 


operation of the motors from the normal operation. In future 


research, more sophisticated sensors will be applied to collect 


data at a higher frequency that can further improve the AI/PCA 


model.
