Increased risk exposure levels, technological developments and the growing information overload in supply
chain networks drive organizations to embrace data-driven approaches in Supply Chain Risk Management
(SCRM). Data Mining (DM) employs multiple analytical techniques for intelligent and timely decision making;
however, its potential is not entirely explored for SCRM. The paper aims to develop a DM-based framework for
the identification, assessment and mitigation of different type of risks in supply chains. A holistic approach
integrates DM and risk management activities in a unique framework for effective risk management. The fra-
mework is validated with a case study based on a series of semi-structured interviews, discussions and a focus
group study. The study showcases how DM supports in discovering hidden and useful information from un-
structured risk data for making intelligent risk management decisions.


1. Introduction


Risk is an important issue threatening sustainability and competi-
tiveness of supply chains (Aqlan & Lam, 2016; Brusset & Teller, 2017).
The frequency, severity and variety of supply chain (SC) risks are ac-
celerating as a result of increasing globalization, customer expectations
and shorter product life cycles in SC networks (Norrman & Jansson,
2004; World Economic Forum, 2017). Supply chains are exposed to
various internal and external risks with different forms, probabilities
and impacts (Chen & Wu, 2013; Guertler & Spinler, 2015). These risks
can result from a wide variety of sources including uncertain demand,
supply interruptions, volatile exchange rate, political instability, dy-
namic consumer markets and even unexpected events such as work
accidents, cyber-attacks, natural disasters and terrorism (Er Kara &
Oktay Fırat, 2017; Rajagopal, Venkatesan, & Goh, 2017). The triggering
factors of SC risks, their relationships and consequences are very
complex to measure due to the complex nature of these networks
(Brusset & Teller, 2017; Vilko & Hallikas, 2012); and require dealing
with huge amounts of different and distributed data/information
sources (Schlegel & Trent, 2014; Yu, Chavez, Jacobs, & Feng, 2018).


The scope, variety, volume and velocity of data is constantly in-
creasing due to advances in the information and communication tech-
nologies (Addo-Tenkorang & Helo, 2016). Technological developments
and the growing information over-load drive organizations to use data-
driven decision-making approaches (Lee, Zhou, Souza, & Park, 2016;
Long, 2018). A growing number of organizations have started to use


Business Intelligence (BI) and Data Mining (DM) approaches to make
efficient, intelligent and timely decisions (Heaney, 2015; Ponemon
Institute, 2017; Wu, Yue, Jin, & Yen, 2016). DM plays a critical role in
gaining valuable insights into potential SC risk factors, their sources,
impacts and inter-relationships (Ranjan & Bhatnagar, 2011). DM tech-
niques can be used in various stages of SCRM to develop proactive and
reactive systems (Lee, Kim, & Lee, 2017; Wu, Chen, & Olson, 2014).
There are various studies that employ DM techniques for detection and
assessment of selected risks in different research fields (e.g. Ruiz-Torres,
Mahmoodi, & Zeng, 2013; Le, Arch-int, Nguyen, & Arch-int, 2013;
Blackhurst, Rungtusanatham, Scheibe, & Ambulkar, 2018). However,
despite the growing research interest, the academic literature is scarce
and distributed. There is lack of a systematic framework for utilizing
unstructured (risk) data for SCRM (Tobback, Bellotti, Moeyersoms,
Stankova, & Martens, 2017). Furthermore, how to convert risk man-
agement problems into DM problems for making robust risk manage-
ment decisions remains a challenge. A holistic framework with an
ability to integrate DM and risk management approaches is highly de-
sirable to better comprehend the big data. This paper contributes to the
literature by presenting a novel SCRM framework supported by DM
approaches for identification, assessment and mitigation of different
types of SC risks.


The proposed framework is developed following a literature review
of relevant areas and expert opinion of SC managers and BI experts.
This systematic model provides a comprehensive guideline by covering
various activities of a data-driven risk management such as:

oriented data warehouse, properties of a risk analysis and management
team, conversion of the SCRM problem into a DM problem, and inter-
pretation of the results of DM algorithms for risk management purposes.
The framework is validated with a case study in the heavy machinery
sector, and important suggestions are provided for the implementation
of the proposed approach. The developed framework is believed to set a
benchmark for future academic research in the application of DM al-
gorithms in SCRM.


The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the
literature review on key building blocks - BI and DM tools and tech-
niques in SCRM. Section 3 summarizes the employed research metho-
dology. Section 4 introduces the proposed DM-based SCRM framework.
The main steps, implementation issues, advantages and limitations of
the proposed model are explained in this section. Section 5 presents a
case study where the framework is implemented and tested. The section
discusses some of the practical implementation issues and limitations of
the framework. Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion of the
contribution to research and practice and identifies several future re-
search directions.


2. Literature review


There are myriad natural and man-made risks threatening the
physical assets and operations in SC networks. Some of these risks in-
clude price fluctuation, volatile demand, supply problems, operational
risks, delivery risk, reputational risk, and natural disasters (Chen & Wu,
2013; Rajagopal et al., 2017). Decrease in operational performance,
damage to brand value, physical assets and bankruptcy are some of the
occurring consequences of SC risks. SCRM is the systematic approach of
identifying, assessing and mitigating risks in SCs (Ghadge, Dani, &
Kalawsky, 2012). The aim of SCRM is to understand risks and their
effects, and try to take proactive and preventive actions for mitigation.
Today’s information and communication technologies provide the op-
portunity to gather, store and analyze a diverse set of risk-related data
from heterogeneous data sources (Kang et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2016;
Schlegel & Trent, 2014). The “Risk Intelligence (RI)” concept has
emerged as a result of these developments (Lee & Kulkarni, 2011;
Ponemon Institute, 2017). Risk intelligence can be defined as an or-
ganization’s ability to identify, measure, assess and predict threats by
using relevant past data and experience (Apgar, 2006). Limited aca-
demic studies examine risk behaviour or intelligence from a SC point of
view (Ghadge, Dani, Chester, & Kalawsky, 2013).


It is clear that organizations cannot manage their risk without
managing their data and information/knowledge (Neef, 2005); thus,
many organizations have started to use automated risk management
frameworks to compete in today’s knowledge driven business en-
vironment (Haksöz, 2013; Wu et al., 2014). Despite the high interest in
industry, academia has been lagging in terms of the use of BI for
management of SC risks (Aruldoss, Travis, & Venkatesan, 2015; Liu,
Daniels, & Hofman, 2014; Wu et al., 2014). BI contains the databases,
tools, methods, processes and technologies for the transformation of
raw data into meaningful and useful information for business analysis
purposes. Extract, Transform and Load (ETL), data warehousing, Online
Analytical Process (OLAP), statistical analysis, prediction and visuali-
zation are some of the key tools/technologies from BI (Coronel &
Morris, 2017; Sherman, 2015). Similarly, DM plays a critical role in
providing a BI environment (Ranjan & Bhatnagar, 2011) and has sev-
eral applications in different areas (Giudici & Figini, 2009; Köksal,
Batmaz, & Testik, 2011; Murray, Agard, & Barajas, 2017). DM uses
algorithms to discover hidden, previously unknown and useful in-
formation and patterns from large data sets (Han, Kamber, & Pei, 2012;
Witten, Frank, Hall, & Pal, 2017). DM is used for forecasting demand
and price in volatile markets, identification of risky customers and
markets, fraud detection and supporting early warning systems
(Carneiro, Figueira, & Costa, 2017; Lee et al., 2017; Seng & Chen,


2010). Table 1 summarizes some of the DM applications in the risk
management literature.


DM techniques are frequently used in Customer Relationship
Management (CRM), customer churn prediction, and customer risk
analysis in the insurance and banking sectors (De Caigny, Coussement,
& De Bock, 2018; Keramati et al., 2014). Saradhi and Palshikar (2011)
present a literature review on some techniques that are commonly used
to build predictive customer churn models, e.g., Naïve Bayes, Support
Vector Machine (SVM), decision tree and random forests. DM algo-
rithms are also used to provide critical insights into risky customers by
analyzing customer data such as payment records, credit card data,
satisfaction rates, and credit risk scores (Tsiptsis & Chorianopoulos,
2009). Xiong, Wang, Mayers, and Monga (2013) propose a DM-based
personal bankruptcy prediction system that uses credit card data. They
use sequence mining techniques for prediction and later propose a
novel model-based k-means clustering algorithm to discover sequence
patterns. Recently, Lee et al. (2017) have developed a model to predict
customer churn in the mobile industry by analyzing words in online
media. Another popular application area of DM is financial risk as-
sessment. Prediction methods play a critical role in developing early
warning systems for financial crises. Geng, Bose, and Chen (2015) use
multiple classification algorithms (such as NN, decision tree and SVM)
to predict financial distress in a set of companies based on 31 financial
indicators. Recently, Dutta, Dutta, and Raahemi (2017) have developed
a predictive model for both intentional and unintentional financial re-
statements. They employ multiple classification algorithms (e.g. ANN,
decision tree, Naïve Bayes, SVM, and Bayesian Belief Network). Olson,
Delen, and Meng (2012) apply decision tree, SVM, NN and logistic re-
gression to a sample data of 100 US firms that underwent bankruptcy
and compared the performance of these algorithms. Similarly, Tobback
et al. (2017) use weighted vote relational neighbor classifier method to
predict bankruptcy probability of small and medium sized enterprises
by using financial and non-financial data.


DM techniques are also used for fraud detection in the tele-
communications, insurance and finance sectors (Ngai, Hu, Wong, Chen,
& Sun, 2011). Jans, Lybaert, and Vanhoof (2010) use a multivariate
latent class clustering algorithm on the procurement data of an inter-
national financial service provider to evaluate the current risk of in-
ternal corporate fraud. Similarly, Carneiro et al. (2017) have developed
a DM-based risk scoring system for credit-card fraud detection.


The literature review shows that classification techniques such as
decision tree, NN, and SVM are frequently used for risk prediction in
different research fields (Aggarwal, 2015; Dutta et al., 2017; Ngai et al.,
2011). Cluster analysis is another common DM technique in the risk
management area (Jans et al., 2010). Some researchers use clustering to
group companies or market zones to explore, understand and explain
risks in SC networks. Yin, Fu, Ponnambalam, and Goh (2015) propose a
network connectivity embedded k-means clustering approach to identify
high-risk zones and decrease the complexity of a wide SC network. More
recently, Blackhurst et al. (2018) have combined Petri nets and Trian-
gularization Clustering Algorithm to understand how SC network struc-
tures can lead to the vulnerability of a SC to disruptions and examined
propagation of these disruptive events. It is evident that DM techniques
can be effectively used for risk management. However, current research
studies focus only on certain type of risks and DM algorithms (e.g. Xiong
et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2017; Kang et al., 2017) and an integrated fra-
mework is missing. Furthermore, how to convert risk management pro-
blems into DM problems for making robust risk management decisions
within supply chains remains a challenge. Thus, there is a need for a
holistic and systematic DM-based SCRM approach to accommodate most
types of risks and growing information overloads in SCs.

indicators, collection and storage of risk data, translation of the risk
management problem into a DM problem, analysis of the data by using
DM algorithms, and interpretation of the results to identify intelligent
risk mitigation strategies. For achieving this framework, knowledge of
multi-disciplinary areas and a multiple data collection and assessment
approach was essential. First, the SCRM, DM, data warehousing and
information management system literatures were reviewed to develop a
conceptual model. Identification of a risk management team and choice
of the DM technique plays a critical role in developing such a complex
model. The conceptual model was improved and validated using pri-
mary data from interviews and discussions with SC and IT experts.


Types, severity and frequency of risks vary according to the in-
dustry, business and structure of the company. Also each company has
its own risk profile and risk attitude. Therefore, testing of the proposed
framework was attempted in order to gain important insights, com-
ments and criticism from the practitioners’ point of view. A case com-
pany was utilized in order to understand the challenges of im-
plementing a developed framework. The selected case company
operates globally in the heavy machinery sector in Turkey. It manu-
factures machinery and equipment and also establishes complete turn-
key facilities for different industries including mining, cement, wood,
defense, iron & steel, work machines, energy and ship building. Earlier,
the case company was negotiating with Enterprise Resource Planning
(ERP) software vendors to integrate all of its processes (human re-
sources, purchasing, production, research and development, sales,
transportation, finance, etc.) in a single platform to improve process
management and gain competitive advantage. Therefore, this company
was selected to apply the proposed data-driven risk management ap-
proach as they were also struggling with risk management issues.
Firstly, in-depth semi structured interviews, field observations and
focus groups were conducted to identify the core risks that threaten
different functional units and complexities in sharing information
across their process units. This primary data on core risks and data/
information integration challenges provided a basis for the proposed
risk data warehouse structure.


Later, a risk evaluation form was circulated to gather data on the
distribution of the risks and risk exposure levels of different SC func-
tions. Based on the results of this data, clustering analysis was proposed
to group suppliers based on their risk profile (explained in a subsequent
section). Through the implementation and testing of the framework in
the case company, several valuable inferences were drawn in terms of
the applicability of the proposed framework.


4. Development of data mining-based framework


This section presents the development of the DM-based SCRM fra-
mework. First, a general overview of the model is provided. In a later
section, the core stages of the model are explained.


4.1. Overview of the model


Risk originates due to a lack of information, and its identification is
an intricate and costly process due to the high uncertainty of event
occurrence and difficulty in collecting and analyzing the risk data. DM
tools and techniques have the potential to convert risk data/metrics
into useful information/knowledge for more effective, intelligent and
timely SCRM decisions. The unique ability to detect and assess risks,
discover risk sources, identify risk patterns and relationships, predict
risk events, and classify risky items via historical data analysis and real-
time data processing makes DM a valuable approach (Lee et al., 2017;
Ngai et al., 2011; Saradhi & Palshikar, 2011). In order to develop a
holistic data-driven SCRM framework, key principles from DM, data
warehousing and risk management were methodically integrated. The
step-by-step approach for the development of the DM-based SCRM
framework is presented in Fig. 1. The core stages of the proposed model
are: (i) identification of risk indicators, (ii) development of a risk data


warehouse to gather and store risk data, and (iii) incorporation of a DM
module that includes the conversion of the risk management problem
into a DM problem and interpretation of the analysis results for risk
management actions.


Identifying and quantifying the internal and external risks requires a
certain level of knowledge about the structure of the SC network and
the physical, financial and information flows within the network.
Therefore, the conceptual framework developed from the literature was
decided upon and implemented in the focal company. This step gives us
knowledge about the position of the company within the network, its
relations with other stakeholders, the risk exposure and resilience levels
of the industry, risk appetite of the company and current risk man-
agement practices. This step contains the following four sub-tasks:


(i) Collect information about the company: The firm’s size, experience,
business environment, sector, and structure of the SC network have a
significant impact on the type and distribution of risks. Each risk
management model must be developed by considering such crucial
information and should align with the mission, business objectives and
strategy of the company.


(ii) Map the SC network: SC maps provide a bigger picture and thus
help to increase the visibility of the SC network. Visualization techni-
ques may be helpful for a better network representation to discover and
address potential risk areas: e.g., SC heat maps (Basole & Bellamy,
2014; Schlegel & Trent, 2014).


(iii) Determine the risk attitude of the firm: The risk attitude and tol-
erance level of companies affect the risk identification, assessment and
perception, and choice of risk mitigation activities (Heckmann, Comes,
& Nickel, 2015). There may be absolutely zero tolerance of risk for
complying with laws and regulations in some sectors such as healthcare
and defense.


(iv) Evaluate the company’s resilience level to risks: Companies can
prioritize their critical risk areas and focus their risk management
practices in these areas by examining their resilience to different risk
factors. Previous steps help to gain information about the resilience
level of the company in the context of SC risks.


Each of the aforementioned steps has an effect on the prioritization
of risks, identification of risk management problems, and the potential
risk response strategy of the company. The next major step is the
identification of a risk management team which will be responsible
from the SCRM process. Details of this step are provided in Section 4.2.
The risk management team determines the main internal and external
SC risks and identifies the risk indicators that will be used to quantify
and track these risks. From multiple methods used in the identification
of risk events the most commonly used data collection approaches are
survey, interview, focus group, discussion, and field observations in-
cluding historical records (Aqlan, 2016; Chen & Wu, 2013; Thun &
Hoenig, 2011). Risk indicators were used to measure and monitor these
risks. Risk data come from various different internal and external data
sources; therefore, development of a risk-oriented data warehouse
provides a centralized data repository by gathering different types of
risk data. The development of a risk data warehouse is a complex stage
including various sub-steps; therefore, the steps followed for this stage
are explained in Section 4.3.


Identification of the risk indicators and the development of a risk
data warehouse provides the main basis for risk data analysis. The next
step is the assessment of the probability, consequences and detectability
of the risks and their inter-relationship to identify the critical parts of
the SC that are prone to disruptions. A DM module is added to the
SCRM framework that takes the risk management problems as an input
and provides information/suggestions for risk management as an
output (see Section 4.4 for details). This stage starts with the translation
of the risk management problem into a DM problem and is the most
critical step that affects the efficiency and success of the proposed
framework. The details of the DM algorithm are specified, and the data
is pre-processed for analysis. The required data for the identified pro-
blem is gathered from the risk data warehouse via a risk data mart that

is a subset of the data warehouse subject to the determined DM ana-
lysis. The specified DM algorithm is applied, and the results are inter-
preted to provide useful strategies for the risk management problem.
Determined risk management strategies and practices are implemented
based on the knowledge supported by the DM module. The core stages
of the proposed framework are explained in the following sections.


4.2. Creating risk management team & identifying main risks


After analysis of the structure of the company and its external en-
vironment, the second step is to develop a risk management team. DM-
based SCRM requires a collaborative effort of a cross-disciplinary team
with different backgrounds and expertise. A data analyst or DM expert
is necessary in the team to conduct analysis of the risk data following
DM methods. The roles and responsibilities of the team members should
be identified in advance in order to prevent confusion and improve
workforce efficiency. The DM module should be executed by a team
consisting of domain experts, data analysts, and information technology
(IT) specialists (Myatt & Johnson, 2014; Refaat, 2007). According to
Feelders, Daniels, and Holsheimer (2000), three types of expertise are
needed for the analysis phase of DM: knowledge of the application


domain, data expertise and DM expertise. Data warehousing and DM
requires both technical skills and data management knowledge; hence,
the risk management team should contain people from both technical
and business sides (Anderson-Lehman, Watson, Wixom, & Hoffer,
2004). The risk analysis and management committee in the proposed
model consists of four main types of experts: (i) Risk management ex-
perts, (ii) Domain experts, (iii) DM experts, and (iv) IT specialists.


• Risk Management Experts: Risk management experts are needed to
guide other members in the identification and measurement of risks,
and determination of risk management actions.
• Domain Experts: Domain experts are risk owners and are selected
from the application domain. They are responsible for the identifi-
cation of internal and external risk factors within the current SC.
• DM Experts (or data analysts): The proposed DM module utilizes
multiple DM tools and techniques; hence, DM expertise is of sig-
nificant importance for analysis of risk data. In addition to the
technical knowledge on data analysis and management, DM experts
should also have a certain level of knowledge about the application
domain and SC risks for effective coordination with the team.

requires an IT infrastructure; hence, there should be an IT expert(s)
in the risk management team. The IT expert is responsible for data
integration, data access, development of a risk data warehouse and
IT infrastructure, integration of the DM module with the operational
system of the company, and identification, installation, and im-
plementation of the required software and hardware.


4.3. Building a risk data warehouse


Data warehouses provide data infrastructures for decision support
systems (Vaisman & Zimányi, 2014). The DM module is integrated with
a risk-oriented data warehouse to provide a systematic and interactive
data analysis platform. The Risk Data Warehouse (RDW) is the central
repository that gathers and stores both current and historical SC risk
data from different internal and external data sources. The RDW can be
seen as the corporate’s risk memory and provides the opportunity of
analytical processing, monitoring, and reporting of risk data in order to
support data-driven decision-making (Jukic, Vrbsky, & Nestorov, 2017;
Linoff & Berry, 2011). Waterfall methodology is widely used for
building data warehouse systems, and variations of the traditional
model have been proposed for building systems (Royce, 1970). We
adapted the waterfall methodology presented by Rainardi (2008) for
defining ten basic steps for the development and deployment of an
RDW. Building a data warehouse is an enterprise-wide complex and
costly process, therefore, first a feasibility study should be performed to
assess this investment. A company may prefer to develop a separate
RDW or adapt its current data warehouse by including risk indicators
for the new risk data analysis platform. Small companies may also
prefer to use data marts because of the high cost of data warehouses
(Han et al., 2012). Data marts are subject-oriented simple data re-
positories that are developed for a particular business. The choice of the
company depends on various issues including: variety of risk types, risk
exposure level of the company, volume of risk data, frequency of risk
problems, and the budget of the company.


The second step is the identification of risk indicators and determining
the sources of risk data. Risk indicators are measurements, statistics or
parameters of risk drivers and represent the exposure level to a risk
factor over time (Rodriguez & Chadha, 2016). There are myriad in-
dicators that can be used to measure and track different types of risks
such as cost of defects, complaint rate, delivery reliability, exchange
rate volatility, etc. These indicators are used for the detection, assess-
ment and monitoring of risks. Some of the data collection methods for
risk-related data are listed below:


• Gathering risk data from SC information systems: Risk data, especially
operational risk indicators, are generally directly collected from
various operational databases such as ERP and CRM databases
(Solutions, 2014; Robertson, 2016).
• Gathering risk data from external databases: Risk data may also be
gathered from external databases provided by government agencies,
insurance companies, commercial providers, consultancy agencies,
and local and international consortiums (Franzetti, 2011; Knemeyer,
Zinn, & Eroglu, 2009). Global Operational Risk Loss Data (GOLD),
Operational Risk Data Exchange (ORX), and American Bankers As-
sociation (ABA) are several examples for data consortiums
(Franzetti, 2011; Solutions, 2014). Other external data sources in-
clude geographical location data, real time data associated with
natural disasters (e.g., earthquake, hurricane), weather conditions,
and social media data provided by external information providers
(Goh et al., 2013; IBM, 2014).
• Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA): A typical FMEA table for
risk identification and assessment includes the following columns:
risk factors, frequency, severity, risk priority number, recommended
risk management actions and responsible staff (Chen & Wu, 2013;
Giannakis & Papadopoulos, 2016). A risk priority number is calcu-
lated by multiplying the probability, severity and detectability of the


risk. Some researchers also incorporate the likelihood of being de-
tected (ease of detection) either before or after they occur
(Giannakis & Papadopoulos, 2016).
• Simulation: Simulation is a representation of the behavior of a real
system using a computer. Simulation models can be used to model
the behaviour of risks, discover the triggering factors, quantify risks,
and analyze their consequences (Bandaly, Satir, & Shanker, 2016;
Ojha, Ghadge, Tiwari, & Bititci, 2018; Rajagopal et al., 2017). Si-
mulation gives the opportunity to analyze a high number of risk
scenarios by changing the model parameters and provides data
about the behavior of the risk under different circumstances.
• Use of monitoring devices to collect risk data: Technological devices
may be used to track items or determine metrics such as temperature
and pressure. Monitoring devices include RFID systems, sensors,
cameras, motion sensors, wearable devices, energy monitoring sys-
tems, etc. (Kim, Kim, Kim, & Jung, 2016).


The frequency of risk data update is an important decision point
that depends on the risk type and the industry. While timely data carry
significant importance for some critical risk factors such as the ware-
house temperature level in cold chains, flood estimations may be up-
dated periodically due to the seasonality of this risk (Knemeyer et al.,
2009). Data warehousing gathers and stores data from various sources
in a common and consistent format (Linoff & Berry, 2011), and makes
risk-related data accessible, appropriate, and ready for the DM problem.
A conceptual risk data model is developed to understand and organize the
format of different entities and illustrate the inter-relationships be-
tween different data elements. Risk data are transferred by an ETL
process and organized in the RDW by data type, attributes, data source
and relationships. Different schemas such as star schema and snowflake
schema can be used to build a risk data model based on the data source
(Coronel & Morris, 2017; Jukic et al., 2017). The data transformations
need to be defined to convert the data into the appropriate form for the
data warehouse model (Silverston, 2001; Vaisman & Zimányi, 2014).
Data pre-processing steps include data cleaning, integration, reduction,
and transformation (Han et al., 2012). Various types of transformation
procedures can be used to measure risk factors including normalization,
smoothing, aggregation, attribute construction, discretization, and
generalization (Rainardi, 2008; Witten et al., 2017). Composite risk
indicators and formulations may also be generated to measure some
risk types (Hoffman, 2002). Selecting data and pre-processing are the
most time-consuming activities (Feelders et al., 2000; Han et al., 2012).


The next step is the design of risk data warehouse architecture. This
step includes design and specification of the data sources, staging, ETL
system, data flows, data storage, metadata, front-end applications, and
presentaton layer of the data warehouse (Jukic et al., 2017; Rainardi,
2008; Vaisman & Zimányi, 2014). The data source layer of the data
warehouse includes different internal and external sources of risk data
that will be utilized in the RDW. In the data-staging phase, risk-related
data are extracted from the operational databases or external sources to
the data warehouse through the ETL process. The data is transformed
into an analytical structure in the ETL layer. The data storage layer
includes the transformed and cleansed risk data.


The RDW also contains risk metadata (Vaisman & Zimányi, 2014).
The metadata layer is very important for the DM-based SCRM model
because it includes information about risk indicators such as the source
of data, related risk factors, location of the risk (e.g., business process
such as ordering, supplier selection, shipping), owner of the risk, and
data collection frequency and methods (Kayis & Karningsih, 2012; Liu
et al., 2014). It can be seen as a roadmap to access risk data. After the
design of the RDW architecture, the required technology and physical
infrastructure need to be identified based on the scale of the data flow
and budget of the company. The following issues should be specified:
storage area, database server, ETL server, hardware platform, network
topology, required software, client computers, and user interface
(Coronel & Morris, 2017). Then, the designed RDW will be developed and

physical linkages will be carried out between the elements of the RDW
architecture. The final step is to test and implement the RDW by ex-
tracting data from internal and external databases.


4.4. Analysis of risk data using data mining module


The aim of the DM module is to convert the risk data to risk in-
formation/knowledge in order to make intelligent decisions for SCRM.
Risk data is meaningless until it is subjected to data processing. Risk
data is gathered from the server by the DM module and a data mart is
created from the RDW for the current DM analysis. In the proposed DM-
based SCRM model, the data mart that is subject to the DM algorithm is
called a risk data mart. The risk data mart (risk problem database) is a
subset of the RDW and created from this data warehouse by trans-
forming, summarizing, and shaping the data according to the require-
ments of the DM application. Fig. 2 summarizes the DM-based archi-
tecture that is used to convert risk data to risk information and
knowledge.


There are various descriptive and predictive DM tasks that may be
used for analyzing risk data such as classification, prediction, regres-
sion, association analysis, clustering, anomaly detection, etc. (Jukic
et al., 2017; Witten et al., 2017). Each DM task has its own function-
ality; therefore, the selection should be based on the expected output
and the needs for the solution. DM tools and techniques may be used for
the following issues: detect problems, predict risks and their con-
sequences, identify relationships between risks and other factors (e.g.,
triggering factors), identify the root causes of risks, cluster risky items,
etc. (Carneiro et al., 2017; Geng et al., 2015; Hanafizadeh & Paydar,
2013; Kang et al., 2017). Prediction tools may be applied to predict risk
factors and future risk data trends.


As an example, a company may use prediction techniques to un-
derstand how their cash value, revenue, and growth rate are affected by
different risk factors including changes in commodity prices, exchange
rate and energy prices. Regression analysis can also be used to predict
the values of continuous risk data (Carneiro et al., 2017; Olson et al.,
2012). Financial metrics can be used to identify and assess risk ex-
posures; e.g. financial risk prediction and profiling in business. Business
growth rate can be estimated by using different variables such as sales
win rate, customer churn rate and product market share. Anomaly


detection is another common method that is used by financial organi-
zations, insurance companies and telecommunication companies.
Anomaly detection may be used to detect unusual events and patterns
such as abnormal transactions. Interesting and unusual patterns in risk
factors and their sub-factors should be evaluated to examine their ef-
fects on the occurrence of risk events (Lee et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2014).
The reason for such patterns should be determined to develop effective
risk mitigation strategies.


Classification techniques can be used to assign items to certain risk
categories, e.g., risk rating of suppliers, customers and market zones
(Dutta et al., 2017; Geng et al., 2015; Tobback et al., 2017). Various
techniques such as SVM, decision tree, and NN can be used based on the
data structure and the preference of the decision-maker (Lee et al.,
2017; Saradhi & Palshikar, 2011). Cluster analysis can also be used to
group items, regions and stakeholders with similar risk and vulner-
ability attributes (Blackhurst et al., 2018; Hanafizadeh & Paydar, 2013;
Yin et al., 2015). Unlike classification, clustering is an unsupervised
learning method in which the categories are not pre-defined. Various
studies may be conducted to measure the association between different
risk indicators, e.g., association between low sales performance and
customer dissatisfaction ratings, or association analysis on the re-
lationship between employee turnover rate and employee character-
istics.


Fig. 3 presents a set of questions that can assist decision-makers in
converting SCRM problems into a DM problem. The structure includes
risk management problem categories, example guide questions that
may help in selecting the most helpful DM task, and alternative DM
tasks that may provide answers to such risk problems. Decision-makers
should also decide on how to use the results of the DM problems in
assisting risk management decisions, before specifying the DM algo-
rithm (Linoff & Berry, 2011). This decision is important for the effec-
tiveness, practicality, and accuracy of the DM problem formulation.


The selected DM algorithm/model should be evaluated, validated
and refined by the DM expert before the interpretation of the results by
the risk management team. The selected DM technique may also be
compared with other techniques to ensure its validity. Different prop-
erties may be used for this comparison such as explanatory power,
accuracy, speed, robustness, amount of pre-processing needed, and ease
of integration (Gargano & Raggad, 1999). Finally, the results of the

selected DM analysis are interpreted with data analysis, risk manage-
ment and domain experts. The insights gained through the DM model
will be used to develop data-driven, effective and intelligent strategies
for the identified risk management problem.


4.5. Interpreting results of the DM module


Interpretation and evaluation of the results of DM algorithm(s)
provide transformation of risk information to risk knowledge. DM can
provide the following types of information about risks (Larose & Larose,
2015; Ngai et al., 2011):


(i) Prediction of risk events
(ii) Discovery of risk patterns
(iii) Relationship among risks and, between risks and their triggering factors
(iv) Classification of different items according to risks
(v) Clusters of different items based on risk factors
(vi) Summarization of the risk data
(vii) Visualization of the risk data


This step is crucial because a DM-based SCRM framework is highly
dependent on the choice of DM application and evaluation of analysis
results. Visualization tools (Visual DM) may be very helpful in inter-
preting results (Kang et al., 2017). The outputs of the analysis may be
stored in the risk database for future references. After analysis and as-
sessment of risk data, the risk analysis and management team should
identify the actions for mitigation of focused risk factors. There are
various alternative SCRM strategies and techniques (Er Kara & Oktay
Fırat, 2016; Ghadge, Dani, Ojha, & Caldwell, 2017). Alternative supply
chain strategies should be evaluated by domain experts by considering
associated costs and benefits.


5. Implementing and testing the framework in a case company


Firstly, field observations, in-depth semi-structured interviews and
discussions were performed to identify the core internal and externals
risks that threaten different functional units, and identify and define
risk-related indicators based on the requirements of the focal company
(Er Kara, 2017). A top-down approach was employed to select the most
important risk indicators and the final set of risk indicators were de-
veloped following a focus group study. The final set included four types
of risk indicators, as proposed by Chapelle (2013): exposure, stress,
causal and failure indicators / failed key performance indicators. The
Appendix provides some of the risk indicators identified for the focal
company. They can be used to measure and track company’s exposure
to the pre-determined critical risk factors. The identified risk factors
and risk indicators form the basis for development of a risk-oriented
data warehouse for the company.


A risk evaluation form was applied to the staff from different de-
partments in order to assess threat domains and understand the dis-
tribution of risks within the company and its SC network. Respondents
were asked to evaluate potential risks threatening their company by
rating probability, consequences and the difficulty of detectability
based on a ten-point Likert scale. Fig. 4 represents the risk exposure
levels of different operational units based on participants’ responses. As
seen from the figure, the most risky functions of the company are de-
termined as purchasing, sales and product/project design functions.
Fig. 5 also provides the top 15 risks identified in the case company
based on the average risk priority numbers. This study helped to
identify the risky parts of the SC network and gave empirical evidence
and insights for the selection of the risk problem that is subject to the
DM analysis.


Based on the ratings of respondents and discussions with managers
in the company, the supply risk category was selected as the subject of

DM analysis. The company has a make-to-order strategy and produces
highly customized products; hence, the performance of the suppliers
has a significant impact on the success of the company. An effective
procurement and supplier management process considering supplier
risk factors is vital for the success of the organization. The main source
of the supplier risk resides in both inefficient supplier evaluation and
selection process and the difficulty to find an alternative supplier in an
emergent situation. Therefore, the main risk management problem may
be stated as the characterization of the suppliers based on their risk
profile. This problem is translated into a DM problem. For more on the
selection of DM application refer to Er Kara and Oktay Fırat (2018). 72
suppliers of the company were assessed based on 17 qualitative and
quantitative risk types. The weights of the criteria were determined by
using the Best-Worst method (Rezaei, 2016). Factor analysis was ap-
plied to decrease the number of criteria. Later, k-means clustering al-
gorithm was applied to group core suppliers of the company based on
the generated four risk factors. Three clusters with different risk ex-
posure levels were identified and the results were interpreted to provide
insights to mitigate supplier-related risks in the supplier evaluation and
selection phase. The clusters include 19, 11 and 42 suppliers respec-
tively. The mean values of the risk criteria for these clusters are given in
Table 2. Cluster 3 has the highest risk scores for most of the risk types,
Cluster 2 has lowest and Cluster 1 average risk scores. The results of the
cluster analysis help the company to eliminate risky suppliers and ob-
tain manageable smaller and homogeneous supplier groups. The results


may also be used to develop specific supplier development programs to
reduce supplier-related risks.


Based on the experience of implementing a DM-driven SCRM fra-
mework in the selected company, the following observations were
made.


• Implementation of a DM-based SCRM framework is not a one-time
process and requires a continuos monitoring for the changes in risk
factors and associated results.
• Translation of the risk management problem into a DM problem is
one of the most crucial steps of the developed framework. The risk
management team should give significant emphasis to how to use
the results of the identified DM method.
• It is not possible to analyze all of the risk types in one go. Therefore,
each DM problem should focus on a specific risk category or busi-
ness process and should be regarded as a new project.
• Development of a RDW may require high costs and workforce for
companies; hence, organizations should perform a feasibility study
before data warehousing. Instead of building a RDW, small-sized
organizations may prefer to develop a risk data mart directly from
the company’s current databases. Data marts are subsets of data
warehouses and require lower costs. However, the data preproces-
sing and transformation part will require higher effort.
• If the proposed framework will be used on a daily basis to analyze
and monitor risks, it should be integrated with the existing in-
formation system and data warehouse of the organization for re-
ceiving real-time information. An expert system or a decision tree
model may be integrated to automate the selection and application
of the DM analysis.
• Selection of the DM application requires knowledge about the
company, expertise on risks, and an expertise on DM tools and al-
gorithms. Hence, the success of this part depends on the expertise
and experience of the risk analysis and management team.


Several limitations were also identified while implementing the
proposed DM-based SCRM framework. The input of the DM algorithms
are the databases. Hence, there are two important issues that have a
significant effect on the accuracy of the results of the DM module: (i)
the database should provide complete, accurate, clear, related, and up-
to-date data, (ii) the right metrics should be determined to measure and
track-identified risk factors. Furthermore, adaption of the DM-based
SCRM model depends on the current technology level within the

organization. It may require additional investments for technological
infrastructure and workforce to implement the model.


6. Conclusion


The volume of data generated and transmitted across SC networks is
on rise with developments in communication and information tech-
nologies, increasing collaboration between stakeholders and digital
transformation of supply chains with the adaptation of Industry 4.0
technologies (such as RFID, Internet of Things and cyber physical sys-
tems). These technological enhancements and business innovations are
driving SC managers in making data-driven decisions. Despite growing
interest in the industry, academia has been lagging in using data-driven
approaches to manage SC risks. The study contributes to the literature
by developing a comprehensive DM-based framework for SCRM. Key
activities involved in risk management and DM are combined for de-
veloping a road map to achieve effective and intelligent risk manage-
ment systems for today’s digital supply chains. Besides developing a
SCRM platform for companies, the proposed framework provides a
comprehensive guide to systematically collect, analyze, monitor and
manage SC risk data from multiple information sources. The study
showcases how DM supports in discovering hidden and useful in-
formation from unstructured risk data for making intelligent risk
management decisions.


Data mining driven SCRM framework is unique and has not been
addressed in the past. By integrating different process modules, the
study provided a holistic approach, which is practical and easy to im-
plement, demonstrated using a case study example. This integrated and
structured data driven procedure is partially implemented and tested in


a global company. Practical implementation issues and suggestions are
provided through the observations and findings of the case study. The
model was tested using a single case company and thus, the applic-
ability, learnings and limitations of the framework are difficult to
generalize. However, the proposed DM-based risk management model
is expected to make organizations smarter by providing a better un-
derstanding of the SC risks, their critical effects and interdependencies
between them. Proactive and reactive mitigation strategies can be de-
veloped based on the assessment of risk data. The study reflects on the
potential of DM tools and techniques to increase visibility and respon-
siveness of SCs. Following this study, it is evident that DM provides
interactive and distributed knowledge discovery applications and has
huge potential specifically in SCRM and SCM in general. This study is
expected to set an initial basis for further research and developments in
the data-driven frameworks for supply chain risk management.


The application part of the framework was limited due to the re-
quirement for technological and workforce investments to implement
and test the developed framework. Future research can explore some of
the limitations captured in this study. Additionally, there was lack of
comparative multiple DM applications to validate the framework.
Future research can also focus on implementing the data mining-based
SCRM framework in multiple organizations for drawing universal in-
sights.
