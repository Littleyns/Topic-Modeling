This study aims to measure the perceived business benefits of blockchain technology implementation in the 
banking sector and establish factors to measure these benefits. Concerns regarding security, values, and stan-
dards are essential to banking operations. Data was collected from 291 respondents who are either blockchain 
consultants, blockchain marketing experts, or CEOs/business heads of banks that are in the process of advising, 
consulting, or implementing blockchain technology. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was carried out to assess 
the reliability and validity of the proposed instrument. The results support the proposed instrument and its five 
constructs. The scale emerging from this study indicates a good degree of reliability, validity and unidimen-
sionality in each of its constructs. Technologies like blockchain are in their initial stages, and recent advances in 
blockchain technology may impact our findings. The developed instrument could help give decision makers a 
foundational view to measure the benefits of implementing blockchain technology before they choose to inte-
grate it in their existing system. The scientific and societal significance of the study based on its practical and 
theoretical applications is presented at the end.   


1. Introduction 


In recent years, our society has experienced the emergence of an 
innovative wave of disruptive technologies spread among different in-
dustries labelled “Industry 4.0′′ (Hou et al., 2020; Chang et al., 2019). In 
the early years, the concept of Industry 4.0 was confined to the 
manufacturing sector (Skilton and Hovsepian, 2017). By using Industry 
4.0 disruptive technologies, many manufacturing units have witnessed 
an enhancement in their capabilities and performance (Büchi et al., 
2020; Szalavetz, 2019). In addition to manufacturing companies, many 
service industries ranging from telecoms to banking are expecting ben-
efits from the digital technologies of Industry 4.0 (Kohtamäki et al., 
2020; Frank et al., 2019). These digital technologies have enabled many 
new business models (Sung, 2018). In today’s world, the service in-
dustry accounts for the largest share of GDP in most advanced econo-
mies (Mariani and Borghi, 2019). These service industries are currently 


either using or testing these technologies to change the way they do 
business. A wide array of technologies such as cloud computing, 3D 
printing, the internet of things (IoT), and cyber physical systems (CPS) 
along with artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain fall under the scope 
of the Industry 4.0 revolution (Chang et al., 2020c). The advantage of 
these disruptive technologies lies in their self-learning ability, their se-
curity and their predictive ability in dynamic conditions. Cloud 
computing can help integrate the knowledge and needs of customers 
with data for personalized services in the banking industry (Larson and 
Chang, 2016; Zineldin and Vasicheva, 2015). In financial services, se-
curity is always a concern, and the IoT has therefore been applied to 
payments, banking and insurance activities (Mani and Chouk, 2018). 
Apart from this, CPS has enabled real-time service abilities like auto-
matic teller machines (ATM) and mobile financial services (Gai et al., 
2017). Machine learning, which is one of the AI technologies, helps 
banks serve customers faster and comply with regulations. In addition,

these technologies are utilized for supervisory purposes (Wall, 2018; 
Moro et al., 2015). 


Banks and financial institutions are considered to be the lifeline of 
modern society and act as a catalyst in stimulating and nourishing 
economic growth in developing countries like India (Iqbal and Sami, 
2017; Disyatat, 2004). The Indian banking sector is facing issues such as 
increasing operational costs, an ever increasing number of fraudulent 
transactions and challenges in ensuring transparency (Kumar and Pra-
kash, 2018; Jayadev et al., 2017). The banking system needs to explore 
robust technologies to avoid fraud and carry out transactions quickly 
(Sunder et al., 2019; Repousis et al., 2019). Furthermore, the system 
needs to ensure cost efficiency in its operations and transparency for its 
customers and regulators (Altankhuyag, 2019; Ray, 2016; Dong et al., 
2014). To this end, the banking sector has adopted many platforms that 
are driven by technologies to enhance banking activity performance 
(Palmié et al., 2020). Blockchain has the potential to eliminate in-
termediaries, improving transparency and traceability of transactions by 
streamlining, simplifying and enhancing the traditional business pro-
cesses of banks (Frizzo-Barker et al., 2019; Hassani et al., 2018; 
Hyvärinen et al., 2017). According to Accenture, the global banking 
sector can save up to $20 billion by the year 2022 via the innovative 
application of blockchain (Accenture, 2018). 


Blockchain technologies are considered promising, innovative, and 
have a substantial influence on industry and social order (Alter, 2019; 
Wu et al., 2019; Chen, 2018; Ducas and Wilner, 2017). Blockchain in 
banking and investment-related solutions weathered a period of cyni-
cism before its significant worth was recognized (Pereira et al., 2019; 
Gartner, 2018). Blockchain technologies are the foundation of many 
cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin (Wang et al., 2019c; Li et al., 2017). It is 
a distributed ledger technology that can register transactions among two 
or more parties (Iansiti and Lakhani, 2017; Kuo et al., 2017; Lemieux, 
2016). According to reports by Gartner, “Blockchain is an expanding list of 
cryptographically signed, irrevocable transactional records shared by all 
participants in a network. Each record contains a time stamp and reference 
links to previous transactions”. Based on this information, participants 
with the right permissions and access can track the transaction history 
(Andoni et al., 2019; Drosatos and Kaldoudi, 2019; Beck et al., 2017). 
Blockchain can be further classified into public and private chains. In the 
public blockchain network, there is no limit set by management, and 
anyone can join the chain (Viriyasitavat and Hoonsopon, 2019; Ying 
et al., 2018; Marsal-Llacuna, 2018; Sikorski et al., 2017). It can be 
maintained by anyone with enough computational power. The public 
model allows for self-certification of participants to join or quit at will 
and has decentralized trust with no central identity management (Can-
gemi and Brennan, 2019; Saberi et al., 2019; Alabi, 2017). Private 
blockchain networks are closed groups that support models with 
centralized identity and membership requirements, making overall 
control much easier, but limiting participation (Morkunas et al., 2019; 
Vranken, 2017; Yoo, 2017). However, secure and efficient private 
blockchain could be vulnerable to manipulation due to centralized 
governance (Shrestha et al., 2019; Reyna et al., 2018; Kshetri, 2017). In 
addition, the benefits of blockchain can be viewed through the lens of 
institutional, market, and technical factors (Governatori et al., 2018; 
Koppenjan and Groenewegen, 2005). The narrative of blockchain’s 
scientific aspects has been examined from a theoretical perspective as 
compared to a technical or architectural one (Liu et al., 2019; Lemieux, 
2016). Hardly any effort has been made in the literature regarding the 
development of an instrument to measure the perceived paybacks of 
executing blockchain technology with a specific focus on the banking 
sector. The background of blockchain technology therefore leads us to 
pose the following research questions: 


R1. What are the perceived business benefits of implementing blockchain 
technology in the banking sector? 
R2. How can we measure the perceived benefits of implementing block-
chain technology in the banking sector? 


In this paper, first we discuss the theoretical background based on 
prior research to measure the perceived benefits of implementing 
blockchain technology with a specific focus on the banking sector. 
Second, we discuss the findings of the qualitative investigation with 
which we developed an initial pool of instrument items to measure the 
perceived benefits of implementing blockchain technology. Third, we 
present the outcomes of our study with sample data collected from 
blockchain consultants, blockchain marketing experts and CEOs/busi-
ness heads of banks that serve to purify and validate the instrument. We 
then elaborate on our findings in the discussion section. After the dis-
cussion section, we present the theoretical and practical implications. 
Finally, we conclude the study and present the limitations and future 
scope of research. 


2. Literature review 


2.1. Blockchain technology use in the banking sector 


The Indian banking industry is currently experimenting with and 
examining a number of business circumstances and their relationship 
with blockchain technology, such as vendor financing, customer loyalty 
programs, and syndicated loans (Deloitte, 2017). Popular banks in India 
(for example: the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), Yes Bank, Axis Bank and 
the State Bank of India (SBI)) are considering the implementation of 
blockchain technology, which may be much faster, more transparent, 
and more secure way to serve their customers more efficiently (Andoni 
et al., 2019; Sharma, 2018; Yoo, 2017). The State Bank of India is the 
largest bank and has been the first to develop a blockchain consortium 
for financial transactions composed of about 10 banks. The bank 
completed its first project using blockchain to enable its members to 
share Know Your Customer (KYC), Combating the Financing of 
Terrorism (CFT), and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) situations (Gupta, 
2018). However, this technology has yet to be verified with regard to 
know-how (Zheng et al., 2018; Nofer et al., 2017). Apart from India, 
other countries and firms are using different approaches to blockchain. 
Well-known econometric models have been adapted and applied to 
improve analysis and make businesses more competitive (Ji et al., 
2020). Blockchain as a technology has the potential to be exceptionally 
useful to the investment and banking industry as an eco-system (Hassani 
et al., 2018; Beck, 2017; Oh and Shong, 2017). Literature on the benefits 
of implementing blockchain in the banking sector are available from 
various sources, such as industry published whitepapers, blogs, wikis, 
and conference proceedings (Cole et al., 2019; Hyvärinen et al., 2017; 
Larios-Hernández, 2017; Yeoh, 2017). This section discusses the pro-
spective benefits of implementing blockchain technology from corner to 
corner in the banking sector. 


Banks primarily apply blockchain technology for fund transfers, 
registrations, and maintaining back-end utilities (Andoni et al., 2019; 
Taylor et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2018). This technology works like a 
distributed ledger and is completely open to anyone and everyone in the 
network. Once the data is registered in blockchain, it is very difficult to 
alter or transform it, making blockchain inherently secure (Pratap, 
2018; Reyna et al., 2018; Iansiti and Lakhani, 2017). Jaag & Bach (2017) 
studied the opportunities that may arise from blockchain technology in 
postal organizations, such as decentralized platforms, secured record-
keeping and fast transaction systems. This sector, like the banking 
sector, is starting to explore blockchain to improve its operations. 
Different banks have different approaches to experimenting with and 
adopting this technology. Some banks are exploring internal options 
first, while others are trying to use the technology to explore options 
between banks first (Andoni et al., 2019; Rijmenam, 2018; Eyal, 2017). 


Blockchain technology is a cross-boundary process providing trusted 
and efficient solutions to multiple stakeholders in multiple organizations 
(Dubey et al., 2020; Upadhyay, 2020; Manski, 2017). It provides a 
platform for innovation to meet the needs of stakeholders based on their 
expectations and applications. (Chen, 2018; De la Rosa et al., 2017). 


P. Garg et al.

This technology is an accurate representation of data structure that 
keeps track of multiple transactions and safeguards the transparency, 
security, and decentralization of the data (Andoni et al., 2019; Knirsch 
et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2018). Blockchain technology is expected to 
bring greater transparency to monetary transactions and advance the 
efficacy of countries’ financial systems (Kshetri, 2017; Guo and Liang, 
2016). Blockchain technology can provide a new revolution especially 
in the banking sector with better payment clearing mechanisms and 
upgraded credit information and management systems, which would 
lead to a more efficient banking system (Cai et al., 2019; Mengelkamp 
et al., 2018; Guo and Liang, 2016). The remittance cost through block-
chain accounts to 2 to 3% compared to 5 to 20% through third-party 
facilitation in the traditional banking system, especially in 
cross-country payments. However, if the payments are made in crypto-
currencies, this may pose certain challenges. Therefore, until a balance 
of interests and regulations is achieved among countries, payments 
using cryptocurrencies may not be possible (Zhang et al., 2020). Apart 
from this, blockchain provides a new institutional technology as it in-
fluences the transaction cost in a new decentralized system and re-
defines the governance of banking companies (Nofer et al., 2017; 
MacDonald et al., 2016). Rahman et al. (2018) discussed the potential of 
blockchain in providing safe and secure networks for the financial sys-
tem. Cai (2018) mentioned that blockchain technology eliminates 
financial intermediaries, as it provides direct peer-to-peer payments 
online and provides digital contracts without government regulatory 
control. 


The most frequently mentioned benefits of blockchain technology 
include cost efficiency, above-average profits, better recordkeeping 
systems, smart digital contracts with universal online identification 
systems, a safe digital platform, scope for improvement and few regu-
latory controls (Andoni et al., 2019; Puthal et al., 2018). Some of the 
paybacks of industrial blockchain include enhanced compliance, 
reduced risk, advancement and streamlining of capabilities, and rein-
forcement and automation of trust, which are age-old business processes 
(IBM, 2016). In addition to this, the underlying technology optimizes 
clearing process efficiency and financial asset spending following 
transactions and leads to a reduction in costs (Hassani et al., 2018; 
Tapscott and Tapscott, 2017; Guo and Liang, 2016). According to Nelito 
(2018), the adoption of blockchain could potentially save billions of US 
dollars for the banking sector by radically decreasing handling and 
processing costs. Since each transaction block in blockchain has a 
timestamp, it can help reduce fraud in the banking industry (Oza, 2018; 
Harigunani, 2017). In the traditional system, it takes days to update 
ledgers, whereas blockchain technology can do it immediately, auto-
matically, and transparently (Kim and Laskowski, 2018; Nofer et al., 
2017). High data quality can be maintained in the banking system 
(Martin, 2018). Banks can reduce their transaction fees if they are able to 
reduce the costs of operations and eliminate intermediaries. Blockchain 
eliminates the risk of errors and duplication, and as a result, stored data 
is complete, accurate, and reliable (Reyna et al., 2018; Thurner, 2018; 
New Age Banking Summit Europe, 2018). Blockchain technology offers 
many opportunities, such as better financial infrastructure and 
sustainably-developed, efficient systems, especially in the banking 
sector (Lu et al., 2019). It promotes better economic growth and de-
velops green technology all over the globe due to its low energy con-
sumption. (Kouzinopoulos et al., 2018; Cocco et al., 2017). Dale (2018) 
argued that rapid international payments would condense expenses for 
banks immensely and result in a considerable improvement in terms of 
proficiency and competence. Blockchain can also lead to greater trust 
among occupational partners since access to technology is shared and 
they can depend on reliable records and robust safety structures 
(Iskandar, 2017). Blockchain is real-time and open-source to create 
value for the stakeholders in the banking system (Accenture, 2018). 
Radical changes in the existing banking system can foster innovation 
and lead to growth with a considerable decrease in risk through block-
chain technology (Umalkar, 2016). It is easy to trace the identity of each 


authorized person in the blockchain-lead banking system, which helps 
to conduct reliable and accurate audits. Since the banking system is a 
part of the service economy, intangibility and simultaneity are essential 
characteristics. Service delivery, confidentiality, continuous innovation 
and integrity of data are therefore crucial in banking systems and can be 
implemented through technology like blockchain (Sivarajah et al., 2017; 
Iyer, 2016; Abdullah et al., 2011; Bygstad and Aanby, 2010). 


Song et al. (2016) explained that blockchain empowers a databank 
that can be shared directly without a principal owner. They also iden-
tified some of the advantages, such as extraordinary quality of data, 
durability and reliability of data, empowered users, longevity, process 
truthfulness, transparency and immutability, a simplified ecosystem, 
increased transaction speed and significantly reduced transaction costs. 
In short, blockchain will push the system to become more resilient by 
helping banks authenticate, merge, and trade economic statements, 
validate agreements, retain reviews and audit tracks and discourage 
money laundering (Helo and Hao, 2019; Swaniti initiative, 2018; 
Kewell et al., 2017; Kshetri, 2017) According to Kloppmann (2017), 
blockchain for financial services means trust for all. 


Blockchain can disrupt the banking industry by facilitating lower 
fees on fund transfers and bringing faster settlement systems through the 
distributed ledger, which can further reduce the cost of operations 
(Frizzo-Barker et al., 2020; Governatori et al., 2018). The society we live 
in often faces the need to raise funds due to unexpected events like di-
sasters or pandemics, most recently with Covid-19. Blockchain could 
potentially offer a new model of access to capital as compared to 
traditional fund-raising systems (Chen, 2018). In today’s society, most 
people need loans for their present and future requirements such as 
housing, vehicles, and other personal needs. Blockchain can help elim-
inate the gatekeepers in the process of getting a loan with a lower in-
terest rate and offer a rate more quickly (Wang et al., 2019d). Blockchain 
is therefore expected to change the way individuals and societies 
interact. Blockchain can help promote transparency, decrease costs and 
increase productivity, which will facilitate the social impact. We will 
describe the trends, challenges, and opportunities of blockchain with 
regard to the financial services sector below. 


2.2. Trends in blockchain technology application 


In recent years, blockchain-based applications have become 
increasingly common in the field of financial services (Casino et al., 
2019; Zheng et al., 2017). Financial services and insurance firms are 
investing in blockchain technology to improve the security of certain 
data classes, enhance the capability of the system and increase cooper-
ation with other setups (Pazaitis et al., 2017). Blockchain has been 
applied to financial asset management and economic transactions 
(Haferkorn and Diaz, 2015). Transactions are decentralized and 
immutable due to systematic ledger distribution. Blockchain is thought 
to contribute to global sustainable development by offering consumers 
the benefits of the current banking system (Liu et al., 2020; Nguyen, 
2016). Blockchain has the potential to resolve the problems of trust, 
security, and control over data in financial services (Zhu et al., 2019; 
Iyer (2016)), and this is therefore another reason why financial services 
look to blockchain in the adoption of smart contracts (Wang et al., 
2019a; Macrinici et al., 2018). It proposes a revolution in capital mar-
kets and makes operations more secure, especially through digital 
payment (Gao et al., 2018; Rohr and Wright, 2018; Yamada et al., 2017). 
Furthermore, activities including loan management, governance, gen-
eral services, and auditing in financial services are more effective with 
the help of blockchain technology (Gazali et al., 2018; Dai and Vasar-
helyi, 2017; Ølnes et al., 2017). Financial service organizations are 
taking steps towards this. For instance, JP Morgan Chase’s Quorum unit 
is working on a blockchain solution with a special focus on contracts and 
the distributed ledger. Another firm, Bank of America, recently filed a 
patent and trademark for blockchain technology (Crosby et al., 2016). 
Another promising project is being spearheaded by Goldman Sachs to 


P. Garg et al.

address the problem of volatility (Bouri et al., 2017). The adoption of 
blockchain-like technologies will help firms improve costs, customer 
care, and innovation capabilities. Stakeholders will soon develop more 
trust and accept blockchain as a sustainable part of their financial 
activities. 


2.3. Challenges of blockchain technology application 


Different industries and platforms have experienced problems in 
adopting blockchain. For instance, in e-governance, issues related to 
security, scalability, and flexibility are common (Chang et al., 2020a). In 
addition, a lack of legitimate and regulatory support is another barrier 
for blockchain in the public sector (Batubara et al., 2018). We have 
classified the challenges of blockchain technology applications into four 
categories: 


2.3.1. Scalability 
The scalability of processing power is another challenge with regard 


to the computational capability of devices, and that capability is 
addressed with limitations such as “sharding”. Sharding is an approach 
to splitting computational and workload storage into parts (Reyna et al., 
2018; Sharma and Park, 2018). On the technical side, the available al-
gorithms for different blockchains are currently slow and consume more 
energy than expected (Janssen et al., 2020; Upadhyay, 2020). In the 
energy sector, the way in which blockchain could facilitate peer-to-peer 
energy trading, electric vehicle charging, and e-mobility is still a ques-
tion (Andoni et al., 2019). Many industries have invested heavily in their 
legacy systems, which work smoothly otherwise, making integration 
with these systems another challenge for blockchain (Schuetz and 
Venkatesh, 2020; Reyna et al., 2018). 


2.3.2. Security 
Blockchain technology is expected to top the market in the near 


future with its clear revenue potential, but blockchain security remains a 
concern due to the nature of distributed ledger technology (DLT). The 
critical vulnerabilities with DLT culminate outside the blockchain, at 
what is called an endpoint, where individuals and businesses access 
blockchain-based platforms (Lu, 2019; Gordon and Catalini, 2018). 
Public and private keys are required to access data and the possession of 
keys and ownership of content run parallel. Therefore, there is a strong 
chance that hackers could steal the keys to attack the system at its 
weakest point (Zhang et al., 2020). Due to weak security systems (flawed 
code) at their end, vendors risk having other partners expose blockchain 
credentials (Hughes et al., 2019). In many blockchains including bitcoin, 
an attack from a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) could 
result from untested code. 


2.3.3. Regulation and governance 
While many organizations are counting on blockchain for many of 


their problems, they also face certain challenges. One roadblock is the 
lack of awareness and understanding of the technology among organi-
zations (Saberi et al., 2019). Firms are also struggling to identify 
adequate platforms, suppliers, and partners to develop blockchain pro-
totypes (Clohessy and Acton, 2019; Hughes et al., 2019). Customer data 
encryption is another major challenge due to the enhanced knowledge of 
hacking. There are no instructions and guidelines as to how financial 
services can utilize different modes of blockchain to manage their in-
ternal network and external exchange of information in terms of pay-
ments and transactions (Casino et al., 2019; Reyna et al., 2018). Though 
the decentralized approach of blockchain technology is a core charac-
teristic, it poses definite restrictions on financial services (Kar-
amchandani et al., 2020; Khan and Salah, 2018). Misalignment of 
objectives and motives among multiple stakeholders becomes a chal-
lenge in a decentralized environment (McCallig et al., 2019). 


2.3.4. Cost and efficiency 
The cost and efficiency of blockchain are critical concerns for many 


organizations (Casino et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2017). Although, 
blockchain technology is fairly capable when it comes to reducing costs, 
it still faces limitations in legacy systems. The initial investment and 
infrastructure development for blockchain is expensive (Reyna et al., 
2018). Smaller financial services or banks may prefer not to invest in this 
technology (Marco and Lakhani, 2017). High maintenance costs also 
create an obstacle to the adoption of blockchain technology (Cao et al., 
2019). In fact, several obstacles must be overcome before this technol-
ogy can be used. Blockchain adoption has complex human-related issues 
as well, such as knowledge-hiding, which was reported in the early days 
of adoption to prevent institutions or management from being successful 
(Chang et al., 2020b). Firms must therefore keep a close eye on block-
chain development and prepare themselves for its adoption. 


2.4. Blockchain technology application opportunities 


Organizations need to encourage their employees to participate and 
attend internal knowledge sessions along with conferences on block-
chain to enhance their capabilities (Lizcano et al., 2020; Attaran and 
Gunasekaran, 2019). Firms need to encourage cross-functional teams to 
develop a detailed plan for successful implementation of blockchain in 
their operations (Islam et al., 2019; Pazaitis et al., 2017). An alternate 
strategy needs to be built to mask data so that no one can access it 
(Wang et al., 2019b). In this virtual environment, regulators have an 
opportunity to analyze, contextualize, and control digital platforms. 
Blockchain offers a transformation in peer-to-peer payment along with 
current practices of storing and processing customer requirements. 
Blockchain can help insurance companies process claims by creating 
smart contracts (Wang et al., 2019a; Macrinici et al., 2018; Sharma and 
Park, 2018). This technology offers transparency and a complete 
traceability mechanism for every claim. The trade lifecycle includes 
multiple stakeholders ranging from settlement agents, custodians and 
brokerage firms to intermediaries (Montecchi et al., 2019). This system 
uses a traditional recordkeeping approach and allows room for in-
efficiency and error. Blockchain technology can therefore help automate 
the trade lifecycle by providing all parties with access to accurate data 
(Narayanaswami et al., 2019). Similarly, trade finance and the digital 
supply chain offer exciting opportunities for blockchain technology. 
This technology can help eliminate unnecessary documents like “letters 
of credit”, reduce costs by removing intermediaries, and develop a 
trusted network for stakeholders (Guo and Liang, 2016). Financial in-
stitutions across the world are required to comply with local regulators. 
One of the key requirements is “know your customer”, which can be time 
consuming without automated customer identification (Doughty, 2005). 
Blockchain can act as a single platform for customer identification and 
therefore allow an unlimited exchange of documents among financial 
institutions (Ying et al., 2018). This approach will help maintain pri-
vacy, which is a legal requirement. The consolidated list of the most 
frequently cited benefits of implementing blockchain in the banking 
sector is presented in Table 1. 


2.5. Synthesis based on a review of the literature 


Based on the literature and framework of Koppenjan & Groenewe-
gen (2005), we have divided the perceived benefits of blockchain 
technology into institutional, market, and technical indicators in 
Table 1. Institutional indicators describe benefits based on the principles 
of rules and regulations among different stakeholders where benefits are 
derived from governance, cultural and regulatory domains. Blockchain 
can help develop a culture of minimizing fraudulent transactions and 
increase trust. Records become auditable by including the appropriate 
origin of different accounts and documents. Blockchain helps develop a 
strong governance platform. Blockchain offers numerous market-based 
benefits described under performance and business processes. Cost

reduction and minimization is one of the key parameters in enhancing 
the performance of financial services (Karamchandani et al., 2020). 
Different costs ranging from transaction, processing, and administrative 
costs must be examined to enhance financial-market efficiency and 
reduce risk among operations. Business processes also improve with 
real-time information, eliminating intermediaries and aligning pro-
cesses. With regard to technical indicators, blockchain offers solutions to 
help drive perceived benefits. First, it facilitates data quality by 
providing adequate protection, accuracy, and control. Second, it offers 
enhanced security and an automated recordkeeping system along with 
faster disbursement and settlement. In any system, the architecture 
needs to be robust and resistant to disruptions. Therefore, the infra-
structure of a financial system can define the sustainability of opera-
tions. Blockchain offers the characteristics of resilience, robustness and 
green technology (Kouzinopoulos et al., 2018). Apart from this, infor-
mation exchange and transactions can be viewed as sources of perceived 
benefits in terms of speedy transactions, integrated systems, minimum 
error, and faster reconciliation. With the help of the above characteris-
tics, we identified the areas of banking where blockchain can help 
transform the industry. Fig. 1 presents various application areas, from 
the cost of undertaking different activities to consumer service and trade 
finance, and illustrates how they securely connect with different parts of 
the value chain. 


The banking industry heavily employs third parties to monitor and 
manage large transactions (Guo and Liang, 2016). The banking industry 
is burdened with the process of authenticating information and checking 
compliance at regular intervals. Blockchain can change this by elimi-
nating the overlap in know-your-consumer and anti-money laundering

(AML) actions. For AML, blockchain can leverage artificial intelligence 
(AI) and machine learning (ML) functionalities to prevent and detect 
unlawful transactions. Blockchain-based AI and ML can effectively sift 
through data strings to identify signals of any illegal activity. These tools 
can help blockchain monitor transactions more efficiently and if any 
suspicious transactions are observed, they can be halted pending further 
investigation. Traditional banking systems have been seen to follow 
decades-old processes for approving transactions and lack transaction 
processing speed. Bank exchange charges are also high for certain 
transactions (Peters and Panayi, 2016). Funds exchanges and speed 
constitute increasingly important criteria for quality consumer services 
in the banking industry. Furthermore, economic activities can be 
accelerated by integrating trade finance and blockchain technology, 
where security and quick settlements are key. 


3. Study design 


This study aims to develop and validate a comprehensive instrument 
to measure the perceived business benefits of implementing blockchain 
technology in the banking industry. The research and development of a 
new instrument should include a comprehensive review of the existing 


literature followed by qualitative interviews to facilitate the identifica-
tion of all relevant domains (Zomorodi and Lynn, 2010). According to 
Domegan and Fleming (2007), “qualitative research aims to explore and 
discover issues about the problem in hand, because very little is known about 
the problem”. A review of the literature and the examination of a list of 
research papers published on blockchain technology have provided the 
foundation of knowledge and key insights of previous research focusing 
on the perceived benefits of implementing blockchain technology. A set 
of 35 items were initially identified from the existing literature 
(Table 1). They were then itemized into institutional, market, and 
technical indicators. It was assumed that these items would be most 
appropriate for measuring the benefits of implementing blockchain 
technology in the banking and related service industries. Since no in-
struments or conceptual models exist to describe the benefits of imple-
menting blockchain technology in the banking sector, there was a 
limitation on generating an item pool for the instrument solely from the 
literature review. We therefore supplemented the literature review with 
qualitative research as a preliminary step in developing items to 
recognize the business benefits of adopting blockchain technology in the 
banking sector of the service industry. Fig. 2 presents the four-step 
methodology adopted in the study. 


3.1. Preliminary study 


During the summer of 2017, as part of a preliminary study, we 
identified thirty experts from the banking sector, IT industry, and 
academia who were closely associated with blockchain-related initia-
tives in the banking sector across India. Expert selection was done in 
four stages. The first stage was the identification of institutions/orga-
nizations that are currently working on blockchain technology. The 
second stage was the identification of experts who are currently work-
ing/involved in blockchain-related projects. In the third step, we asked 
identified experts to participate. After they agreed to participate, they 
were asked to nominate other experts that they felt were worthy. Finally, 
when bringing together the appropriate expert panel, we ensured the 
greatest possible heterogeneity with regard to gender and related work 
areas. However, out of 30 experts, only 22 experts granted appointments 
to conduct semi-structured interviews. The selected panel included 16 
males (73%) and 6 females (27%). Identified experts in the panel had 
varied backgrounds, such as vice president of marketing and corporate 
communication, business head of core banking and payment, technical 
experts, blockchain consultants and blockchain marketing experts along 
with experts from academia. These experts had a vast amount of infor-
mation and knowledge on the benefits of implementing blockchain 
technology in banking and related sectors. Most of the interview sessions 
were conducted face to face at the expert’s convenience at their

respective offices, and three sessions were completed by phone. All the 
conversations were audio-recorded and analyzed separately for further 
research. 


At the beginning of the interview, we briefed each panel expert in 
detail on the study purpose and objective and we asked six open-ended 
questions. Open-ended questions help reduce the chances of excluding 
items or issues that we as researchers may have omitted (Nworie, 2011). 
An unstructured questionnaire enables the experts to give an open 
response and allows plenty of room to elaborate on the topic under 
investigation (Pereira and Alvim, 2015). Among the selected six ques-
tions, three questions were openly linked to the benefits of implement-
ing blockchain, such as: “describe the 5 business benefits of implementing 
blockchain in the banking sector” “describe the purpose of blockchain in the 
banking sector”, or “describe how blockchain will revolutionize the banking 
sector”. For the other three questions, we asked the subjects to provide 
details regarding the benefits of applying blockchain in their banking 
operations, such as “what is the nature of your activities”, “what challenges 
have you faced within the current system”, or “what problems does block-
chain solve”. 


Summarizing the wealth of qualitative data into useful and mean-
ingful items was a critical and complex stage of the study. While con-
ducting the qualitative content analysis on the first three questions, 42 
different keywords were identified for describing the business benefits of 
adopting blockchain technology in the banking industry. Specifically, 
the responses to the first questions (i.e. describe the five benefits of 
implementing blockchain in the banking sector) allowed experts to 
respond freely based on their experience and as a result contributed 
valuable information to delineate the theme and items. Fig. 3 presents 
the framework used for the preliminary study and the outcome of this 
qualitative structure was used to develop a scale of the perceived ben-
efits from implementing blockchain technology in the banking sector. 
Based on the qualitative outcomes, we developed 42 items indicating the 
perceived benefits of blockchain adoption in the banking industry. 


3.2. Items and instrument development 


Following a rigorous review of the existing literature and expert 
opinions, it was decided that 42 items would be included to identify the 
business benefits of implementing blockchain in the banking sector. We 
created an initial draft of a structured, closed-ended questionnaire 
containing 42 items (set of questions) identified from the literature re-
view plus the qualitative research. 


The experts were instructed to rate each of the 42 items for their 
importance and necessity in measuring the business benefits of imple-
menting blockchain in the banking sector on a 7-point Likert scale (1 – 
Not at all important, 2 – Low importance, 3 – Slightly important, 4 – Neutral, 
5 – Moderately important, 6 – Very important, 7 – Extremely important). In 
addition, the experts were asked to provide feedback/comments on 
clarity, ambiguity, wording, and content with regard to the items. Of the 
entire expert panel that was approached for the open-ended interview 
process, only 20 experts contacted to participate in refining the scale 
items agreed. A google documents direct link was sent to the experts to 
complete the questionnaire within two weeks’ time. 


Items for the instrument were selected based on a consensus of more 
than 80% (i.e. very important, extremely important). Out of 42 items, 28 
items scored above 80. Based on the experts’ score consensus, 28 items 
were important and appropriate for the research study. However, 14 
items that scored less than 80% included comments for revision. The 
suggested revisions were made, and the 42 items were sent to the experts 
again to rate appropriateness. Consensus scores for each item were again 
calculated. Any item that did not score above 80% consensus was 
dropped. In the second round of rating, experts agreed that 31 items 
were appropriate and essential with no further revision required in the 
questionnaire. At each phase in the development of the questionnaire, 
the experts’ opinion was taken. This helped with the step-by-step 
development and refinement of the survey instrument. We ensured 
face and content validity of the instrument through rounds of expert

reviews. 


3.3. Pilot testing - Refinement and finalization of the instrument 


Dörnyei & Taguchi (2009) argued that “questions that have been used 
frequently before must have been through extensive piloting”. In order to 
further validate the instrument, before actual data collection took place, 
we conducted a final pilot study with a relatively low sample size to 
measure the business benefits of adopting blockchain in the banking 
sector. The questionnaire was piloted with the responses from 150 
blockchain consultants and blockchain marketing experts. The data was 
collected through a questionnaire and it was processed through a sta-
tistical package for the social sciences (SPSS 20) for factor analysis. The 
primary objective of using factor analysis was to refine the item pool. 
Factor analysis can be conducted in a number of ways and through 
various methods (Field, 2013). Kaiser (1974) and Costello & Osborne 
(2005) state that accepting loading values greater than 0.5 “is reliable 
regardless of sample size.” After conducting the first factor analysis, five 
items were dropped from the measurement, because their factor levels 
were not considered vital as per Kaiser (1974), and we finally zeroed in 
on 26 items presented in Appendix 1, Part B. 


The final draft of the questionnaire contained two sections. Section A 
contained 7 questions designed to define the respondent’s profile. Sec-
tion B contained 26 items designed to measure business paybacks of 
adopting and implementing blockchain technology in banking opera-
tions. The items were presented randomly as statements in the ques-
tionnaire. The items were measured using a 7-point Likert scale. We 
ensured the content and face validity of the instrument via experts. 


3.4. Data collection 


It is important to identify the list of prospective respondents for a 
survey-based study. Since our study is about the development of an in-
strument that may be used by future researchers to measure the benefits 
of blockchain, it is important to consider respondents who are in the 
forefront of and responsible for firm operations. We therefore decided to 
interview business heads. Apart from this, since the technology is in a 
formative stage, it was critical to include blockchain experts and con-
sultants, as they have sufficient knowledge both of the functional and 
business part. 


The questionnaire and a cover letter specifying the purpose and 
significance of the study were created on google docs and made avail-
able to blockchain technology consultants, blockchain marketing ex-
perts, and CEOs/business heads of banks who are currently in the 
process of consulting/implementing blockchain technology in the 
banking sector from April 2019 to November 2019. For the collection of 
data, we used the convenience sampling method. For this study, we 
followed a three-layered process. First, we contacted 600 experts and 
CEOs by phone from October 2018 to March 2019 to get a first-hand idea 
of whether their organization is considering or implementing blockchain 
for their operations. We followed a five-step approach to create the list 
of 600 experts: (i) we identified two sectors (public and private banking 
sector), (ii) we visited the websites of each bank, (iii) we identified the 
branches of banks in a particular area through search options on the 
website, (iv) we called the branch to understand its blockchain tech-
nology aspirations including who handles the vertical aspect of new 
technology implementation and asked for the e-mail and contact details 
of the person concerned, and (v) we were put in contact with blockchain 
consultants and marketers by bank executives. To shortlist these 600 
experts, we applied the criteria of work experience (minimum of five 
years’ experience in heading business verticals) and type of bank (public 
and private sector). We mentioned the objective of the study and ben-
efits in terms of the findings of the study, which would be shared with 
them later. These findings can help them implement blockchain and 
improve integration in different areas. This resulted in 395 eligible 
candidates for the survey based on their profile and the blockchain 


orientation in their organization. Therefore, 395 survey questionnaires 
were sent out individually to the respondents, 320 of which were 
acknowledged at a response rate of 81 percent. Out of the 320, many of 
them had missing data values and a few were answered blindly. Filtering 
therefore resulted in 291 responses that were accurately complete and 
could be used for analysis. 291 responses were sufficient for this study 
with reference to the questions asked. We only required 130 responses, 
but received 291 (Bryant and Yarnold, 1995; Bentler and Chou, 1987). 
We could therefore proceed with further analysis in view of scale 
development. 


3.5. Demographic profile 


The details of the demographic profiles of respondents are presented 
in Table 2. There were a total of 291 respondents, with approximately 
23.36% female respondents and 76.63% males. A majority of selected 
respondents (52.67%) were in the 35–45 age group and the remaining 
47.33% were in the 25–35 age group. Approximately 42% of the re-
spondents were management graduates with an MBA degree and 46% of 
them held a B. Tech./B.E. degree. The remaining 12% of the respondents 
were commerce graduates. About 14% of the respondents were CEOs/ 
business heads of banks followed by blockchain marketing experts 
(42%), blockchain consultants (35.33%), and others (8.67%). It should 
be noted that the maximum age of the respondents was found to be 45 
years of age, since blockchain has emerged in the last decade. A limited 
pool of consultants, experts, and marketers is therefore available, 
particularly concerning those who are active in the banking industry. In 
addition, experienced executives beyond the age of 45 are primarily 
found at the strategic level rather than the implementation level of the 
technology. We were careful to check whether each respondent was 
aware of the disruptive blockchain technology and its benefits in the 
banking sector. It is clear from the profiles of the respondents that most 
of them were involved in blockchain implementation in their own areas 
and sectors. 


4. Data analysis and results 


The collected primary data was analyzed with the help of different 
validated statistical tools and procedures. Essential stages and steps 
required for the development of a measurement scale, such as confir-
mation of internal consistency and reliability of constructs, was ensured. 
This was followed by the factor analysis applied to the collected data. 
Furthermore, CFA was used to ensure the validity of the measurement 
scale. The outcomes of the analysis are discussed in the following sub- 
sections. We used SPSS 20 for EFA and AMOS 26.0 for CFA. 


4.1. Reliability of the instrument 


The quality of an instrument can be measured through its reliability 
(Broadbent et al., 2006). The reliability of an instrument is also a 
necessary requirement to ensure scale validity. The statistical reliability

of an instrument is referred to as the degree to which scores from a test 
are stable and consistent. Therefore, in order to develop a reliable in-
strument, it is important to maintain the reliability of the instrument. 
There are a number of ways to test the reliability of an instrument, 
however, the internal consistency and reliability are easy to estimate 
and are generally found to be effective in the case of field studies (Rust 
and Cooil, 1994). 


Internal consistency is a set of items or statements and the scale 
shows the degree to which these items are standardized or homogenous. 
The internal consistency and reliability of an instrument can be exam-
ined with the help of Cronbach’s alpha (Sun and Hong, 2002). The value 
of Cronbach’s alpha is acceptable if it is greater than 0.7, greater than 
0.8 is considered good, and more than 0.9 is considered to demonstrate 
extraordinary internal consistency (Cronbach, 1951). In this study, the 
overall Cronbach’s alpha value for 26 items was around 0.909, indi-
cating that the identified items were reliable. 


4.2. Exploratory factor analysis 


Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) is a statistical technique for sum-
marizing the information among observed variables into a smaller set of 
factors. The guidelines given by Straub et al. (2004) and Lewis et al. 
(2005) on validation suggested that factor analysis should be conducted 
with the help of EFA. This will help find and define the dimensions for 
the items measured. EFA is normally the first step in building scales. EFA 
is conducted to find the dimensionality of a theoretical construct 
(Iacobucci, 2010). 


To understand the pattern and structure of data, all 26 items from 
Section B of the instrument were exposed to an EFA using principal 
components analysis (PCA) followed by a varimax rotation. The PCA 
begins by extracting the maximum variances and puts them into the first 
factor, whereas varimax rotation reduces the total number of variables 
with high loading against each factor and makes small loadings even 
smaller. Sampling adequacy was tested to identify the suitability of data

for factor analysis through Bartlett’s test and the Kaiser-Meyer Olkin 
test. The estimated value of chi-square was 4174.095 with 325 degrees 
of freedom, indicating a significance level of 0.05. The KMO statistic of 
0.875 is also large enough. The factor analysis conducted here can 
therefore be considered as a correct modus operandi to further analyze 


the data. 
Twenty-six items related to measuring the benefits of implementing 


blockchain in the banking sector were factor analyzed using PCA with 
varimax (orthogonal) rotation. Tables 2 and 3 indicate the outcome of 
EFA and the definition of these factors. The analysis yielded five factors

explaining a total of 67.535% of the variance. Factor 1 was labelled 
“quality customer services” due to the high loadings by items, such as: 
increase in transparency, increase in trust, data accuracy, risk reduction, 
and automation. The first factor was robust, with a high Eigen value of 
2.403 and explained 12.869% of the variance. Factor 2 was labelled 
“reduced costs” due to high loading with the following items: reduced 
administrative costs, decreased transaction costs, elimination of in-
termediaries, and reduced operational costs. Factor 2 with an Eigen 
value of 1.898 explained 11.048% of the variance. Factor 3 was labelled 
“efficiency & security” due to high loading with the following items: real 
time, increased transaction speed, increased efficiency and ensuring the 
integrity of the system. The variance explained by this factor 3 was 
13.657% with an Eigen value of 2.666. Factor 4 was labelled “secure 
remittances” due to the high loading with the following items: faster 
settlements, improved traceability, immutable data record, increased 
control of data, enhanced robustness, enhanced system resilience. The 
variance explained by this factor was 15.077% with an Eigen value of 
7.131. Factor 5 was labelled “regulatory compliance” due to high 
loading with the following items: streamlining the business process, 
reduced fraudulent transactions, improved regulatory compliance, and 
ensuring immutable business rules and data protection. This factor ex-
plains around 14.883% of the variance with an Eigen value of 3.462. The 
five factors have been elaborated for better understanding and to show 
what their items indicate. F1: Quality customer services (QCS): The 
items in this factor are related to benefits of quality customer services 
offered by the banking sector. F2: Reduced cost (RC): The items in this 
factor are related to the benefits of reduced costs in the banking sector. 


F3: Efficiency and security (ES): The items in this factor are related to 
the benefits of efficiency and security in the banking sector. F4: Secure 
remittances (SR): The items in this factor are related to the benefits of 
secure remittances in the banking sector. F5: Regulatory compliance 
(RC): The items in this factor are related to the benefits of regulatory 
compliance in the banking sector. 


4.3. Confirmatory factor analysis 


The proposed measurement model was examined with the help of 
CFA using AMOS 20. The purpose of examining the measurement model 
is to confirm the existence of the required level of construct reliability 
and validity before analyzing the inter-relationship of the constructs in 
the structural model (Ifinedo, 2006; Fornell and Larcker, 1981). The 
final measurement model indicating the different factors affecting the 
expected benefits of disruptive blockchain technology in banking op-
erations is shown in Fig. 4. Constructs such as “Quality customer ser-
vices”, “Reduced cost, efficiency, and security”, “Secure remittances” and 
“Regulatory compliance” are showcased by five, four, five, six and six 
indicator items respectively. The constructs appearing in Fig. 4 were 
devised through the process of qualitative study (open-ended questions) 
followed by empirical study (closed-ended questions) and the structure 
was verified by EFA and CFA. Therefore, the five constructs indicating 
apparent business advantages of implementing blockchain technology 
in finance and the banking industry were measured through 26 in-
dictors. The convergent and discriminant reliability of the measurement 
model were evaluated to investigate the psychometric properties (see 
Table 3). 


Internal consistency measures the reliability of the different items 
included in the survey and is calculated with the help of the Cronbach 
alpha measurement (Streiner, 2003). The Cronbach alpha is an indicator 
calculated using a pairwise correlation between the selected items. The 
Cronbach alpha ranges from 0 to 1. It is estimated for the individual 
items of each construct in order to measure internal consistency 
(Table 3). A Cronbach alpha score ranging from 0.6 to 0.7 is considered 
the minimum required degree of reliability, and for a good degree of 
reliability it should exceed 0.7 (Taber, 2018). The different constructs 
included in the measurement model were found to have a decent level of 
internal consistency as the alpha value is 0.872 for the construct “quality 


customer services”, 0.867 for “reduced cost”, 0.893 for “efficiency and 
security”, 0.892 for “secured remittances”, and 0.883 for “regulatory 
compliance”. Therefore, the included measures were found to be reliable 
and can be used in structural equation modeling (SEM) for further 
research. In our study, we used covariance-based SEM due to its ability 
to offer more verifiable characteristics and hence less bias in the esti-
mated model (Mohamad et al., 2019). 


To measure the reliability as well as the convergent validity of a 
construct in the measurement model, composite reliability (CR) can be 
tested. It offers a more reflective method of overall reliability and cal-
culates the regularity of the construct itself including the firmness and 
similarity of the construct (Hair et al., 2010). A CR value of more than 
0.7 indicates the presence of sufficient scale reliability (Nunnally and 
Bernstein, 1994; Fornell and Larcker, 1981). Table 3 indicates that the 
composite reliability of “Quality customer services” is 0.873, “Reduced 
cost” is 0.869, “Efficiency and security” is 0.893, “Secure remittances” is 
0.893 and “Regulatory compliance” is 0.885. Therefore, it can be deter-
mined that the combined reliability of each construct in the proposed 
model is more than 0.70, indicating that all constructs representing the 
perceived benefits of blockchain technology adoption in banking oper-
ations considered in the model have considerable reliability. 


The convergent validity of a construct indicates the extent of item 
convergence or whether there is a high degree of disagreement overall 
(Hair et al., 2010). Convergent validity is also measured using stan-
dardized construct loadings. High values of standardized construct 
loadings indicate that the items of the construct are substantial and 
demonstrative of their construct. Standardized construct loadings to 
their observed variables should be more than 0.50 (Hair et al., 2010). 
The observed variable loadings in Table 3 were found to be in the range 
of 0.7 to 0.87. The results indicate that observed items are satisfactory 
and significantly represent their constructs. Therefore, we can ensure 
the presence of convergent rationality of constructs. 


The degree to which a construct is different from other constructs 
indicates its discriminant validity (Hair et al., 2010). Two methods are 
used by researchers to analyze discriminant validity. The first is the 
correlation coefficient between the different pairs of constructs in the 
measurement model, which are also theoretically different and should 
not be high. This is due to the fact that different sets of items are used to 
measure different constructs. These items are expected to be different 
from each other and should therefore not be correlated too strongly 
(Trochim, 2006). Second, the average variance extracted (AVE) specifies 
whether the individual constructs in the measurement model are higher 
than the maximum shared variance of each construct and the square root 
of AVE and should be higher than the correlations between the con-
structs. Table 4 shows that “Quality customer services” has a small 
optimistic correlation with “Reduced cost”, “Efficiency and security”, 
“secure remittances”, and “regulatory compliances” (0.407, 0.143, 
0.289, and 0.164). However, “Reduced cost” has a low correlation with 
“Efficiency and security”, “Secure remittances”, and “Regulatory 
compliance” (0.242, 0.236, and 0.167). Similarly, “Efficiency and se-
curity” has little positive correlation with “secure remittances” and 
“regulatory compliance” (0.418 and 0.329). Finally, “secure re-
mittances” has a small positive correlation with “regulatory compliance” 
(0.382). The low correlation between the constructs shows that all of the 
constructs included in the model are independent. Moreover, the AVE 
estimates indicate that the individual constructs are greater than their 
shared variances among the constructs (See Table 3). Furthermore, the 
square root of the AVE marked in bold (Table 4) is greater for diagonal 
constructs compared to non-diagonal constructs. These results indicate 
that each construct is highly interrelated with its items as compared to 
other constructs in the measurement model. Discriminant validity is 
therefore also found in the proposed measurement model. 


The overall validity of the model was evaluated with the help of 
model fit indices such as the normed fit index (NFI), goodness of fit index 
(GFI), root mean square of error approximation (RMSEA), comparative 
fit index (CFI) and Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) (Hair et al., 2010). The

goodness-of-fit indices for the measurement model are presented in 
Table 5. The respective values of χ2/df (1.604), CFI (0.956), GFI (0.895), 
NFI (0.893), TLI (0.951), and RSMEA (0.046) are presented in Table 5. 
Apart from the GFI and NFI, all the values were within the acceptable 
range. The tolerable values are χ2/df 〈 3, NFI, GFI, CFI, and TLI 〉 0.9, 
CMIN/DF < 5, and RMSEA < 0.8 (Gefen et al., 2000; Gefen and Keil, 
1998). The values of GFI and NFI are below the threshold value of 0.90, 
but they are very close to the threshold value, so these values also 
represent a satisfactory model fit. Table 5 clearly demonstrates that the 
measurement model is good fit. 


5. Discussion 


This study aims to develop and validate an instrument to measure 
perceived benefits of implementing disruptive blockchain technology in 
the banking sector. It has undergone a comprehensive systematic liter-
ature review and also includes knowledge obtained from interviews 
with blockchain experts to gain better insights to develop the items. 
Initially, we identified 42 items from the literature review supplemented 
with qualitative research. Results from the iterative instrument devel-
opment and purification process confirmed the relevance of 26 out of 42 
items. After applying suitable concepts and scale development tech-
niques, items were grouped into 5 constructs as: “QCS”, “RC”, “ES”, “SR” 
and “RCo”. Based on the analysis of the statistical results, we defined 
each of the perceived business benefits. Customer services are the key to 
success for any business. Leveraging blockchain technology enables 
banks to build a new type of services for their customers, which can be 
built on the “quality customer services” construct. This construct has 
five items that offer enormous potential to change customer services for 
the better in terms of increased transparency, increase in trust, data 
accuracy, risk reduction, and automation. Implementation of blockchain 
in banking will enhance quality customer services by offering risk-free, 
tamper-proof, transparent, trustworthy, and accurate records to con-
sumers indefinitely. One of the visible business benefits of implementing 
blockchain in a banking system is the reduction of overhead costs. 
Leveraging blockchain technology enables banks to lower overhead 
expenditures by significantly reducing costs, which can be based on the 
reduced cost construct. This construct has the following items: reduced 
administrative costs, decreased transaction costs, elimination of in-
termediaries, and reduced operational costs. The use of blockchain 
technology in the banking sector will lead to the elimination of in-
termediaries, thereby leading to reduced administrative and operational 
transaction fees. In banking systems, the security and efficiency of the 
operation is essential. Blockchain technology can be leveraged to build 
secure and efficient exchanges of financial transactions – which can be 
based on the “efficiency and security” construct. This construct has five 
items: real-time, increased transaction speed, increased efficiency, 
ensuring of system integrity, and increased security. Implementation of 


secure single blockchain networks in the bank will ensure real-time 
access, speed in processing paperwork, and high transaction speed, 
and this all leads to the ensuring of integrity. Secure remittances are 
another challenge for the banking industry and disruptive blockchain 
technology can be very helpful in terms of faster settlements, improved 
traceability, immutable data records, increased control of data, 
enhanced robustness and enhanced system resilience (Wamba and 
Queiroz, 2020). Yet another benefit of implementing blockchain in 
banks is to ensure regulatory compliance requirements effectively and 
efficiently. Blockchain technologies can improve private regulatory 
compliance, which can be based on the “regulatory compliance” 
construct. Therefore, it can help streamline the business processes, 
ensure a reduction in fraudulent transactions and improve regulatory 
compliance along with data protection. This set of perceived business 
benefits answers the first research question. 


In addition to the above perceived benefits, the banking industry can 
offer better products based on customer and market demand via the 
money circle that the bank caters to. Contractual performance can be 
observed in improvement parameters with the help of blockchain 
technology to settle the complex financial asset transactions that are 
bound by an incorruptible set of commercial rules. Every transaction is 
encoded and added to the distribution ledger to make it safe and secure 
with the identification of each stakeholder. A global network of block-
chain technology can help the banking system transform the payments 
supply chain with the lowest risk of failure due to defined rights, con-
trols, obligations, and standards (Palmié et al., 2020). Blockchain 
technology can be used in a plug-and-play manner in the existing and 
future networks of the system. In this study, we measured and validated 
the items through EFA and CFA, and these items or instruments can be 
used to quantify the paybacks of blockchain implementation. This an-
swers the second research question. In terms of significance, blockchain 
technology can be very effective in reducing the cost of operations and 
improving customer services in the banking industry. 


5.1. Research implications 


Blockchain technology is still in its early stages of experimentation 
and testing for large systems. The main contribution of this study is to 
provide a foundation for future research in the field of blockchain. It is 
also worth noting that this study attempts to enrich the literature and 
contribute to blockchain related studies. A few studies that were not 
conducted in the banking industry per se but that concern blockchain 
implementation in general are available for comparison. Blockchain can 
be cost effective and help industries meet regulatory requirements. 
Furthermore, it can enhance the efficiency of banking operations via its 
traceability potential (Hastig and Sodhi, 2020; Min, 2019). Blockchain 
technology offers multiple benefits from smart contracts, renewals, and 
process optimization in the financial services and insurance sector in 
addition to core banking (Brophy, 2019). The cost of Ethereum block-
chain is twice that of the traditional cloud services provided by Amazon 
SWF (Rimba et al., 2018). However, in another study in the energy 
sector, the authors claim that blockchain technology implementation 
helps promote trust, reduce costs for firm as well as customers, and 
enhance security (Noor et al., 2018). In another study, it was noted that 
digital rights management can be designed with the help of a trust model

in blockchain (Ma et al., 2018). For the development and implementa-
tion of blockchain, it is essential to understand what professionals and 
end users think about the technology and its benefits. We found that the 
constructs and items match the reasons for blockchain implementation 
mentioned in the literature concerning closely-related industries (Has-
tig and Sodhi, 2020; Chaudhary et al., 2019; Meng et al., 2019). The 
provider and users can rapidly develop trust in digital banking, which 
can be done through blockchain enabled platforms (Dubey et al., 2020). 
Blockchain technology can be further integrated within a revenue 
department that maintains land records to ensure appropriate loan 
disbursement to build a house or any other type of construction (Thakur 
et al., 2020). Therefore, the development of an instrument to measure 
the benefits of implementing blockchain is a unique contribution of our 
study. The variables were identified from secondary sources and pro-
fessionals and have been grouped into an appropriate construct through 
a structured process. Our validation of the instrument provides impor-
tant insights from scholars and practitioners in the banking industry to 
better understand and advance research on the benefits of blockchain 
implementation. Scholars can extend this study by including new in-
dustries or banking-related industries such as insurance. 


5.2. Practical implications 


Our study outcomes offer fundamental insights for blockchain and 
banking professionals. One of the advantages of using blockchain for 
business is to streamline business operations by reducing unnecessary 
friction among diverse stakeholders. Blockchain enables an organization 
to develop trust and ensure transparency across business transactions. 
Since banking and related industries must handle large amounts of data, 
errors are common with traditional systems. Top executives in the 
banking industry can be sure of data accuracy and thus minimize the 
risks associated with data processing. Banking professionals can use 
blockchain to automate and renew transactions that are repetitive in 
nature across the stakeholders of a business. In this way, banking and 
other firms can employ blockchain technology to design customer- 
centric business activities and provide value-based services. Execu-
tives, experts and consultants in charge of cost reduction in the banking 
industry can consider implementing blockchain-based solutions to 
reduce administrative and operational costs. In the era of information 
and service excellence, it is necessary to keep track of real-time business 
transactions and enhance the efficiency of business operations. Prac-
ticing managers can implement blockchain technology to enhance the 
security and efficiency of their service ecosystem. In the banking in-
dustry, it is critical to have control over data, which must be further 
supported through system resilience. In certain situations such as hu-
manitarian financial crises, blockchain can act as an enabler for the 
robustness and immutability of the audit trail, which is beneficial for 
both firms and auditors. As the banking industry deals directly with the 
finances of individuals as well as firms, it is prone to fraud and distortion 
of records. Executives can benefit from our study, since it recommends 
the application of blockchain to define business rules clearly and 
improve regulatory compliance. Furthermore, acting managers from the 
banking industry can deploy blockchain for record keeping, digital 
currency exchange, smart contracts, and security. Overall, professionals 
from different domains can consider the implementation of blockchain 
with respect to productivity in their business operations. 


5.3. Limitations and scope for future research 


The first limitation of the study is the sample size and geographic 
area. Data used for validation of the instrument came from 291 


respondents, and although this was sufficient for the purposes of the 
study, it somewhat limits the generalization of the findings. Moreover, 
the instrument was empirically tested and validated using data from a 
single developing country. Future studies may consider whether the case 
study has robust claims. This again restricts the ability to generalize the 
findings. Testing the instrument in multiple countries would further 
develop and enhance its applicability. Such further work is necessary to 
prove the validity and confirm the generalization of the findings from 
this study. The instrument developed in this study can be used in further 
studies of blockchain implementation and their relationships with other 
organizational processes and outcomes, such as competitive advantage 
and organizational and operational performance in the banking sector. 


6. Conclusion 


Our study used a variety of validating procedures including an 
extensive literature review (for content validity) and scrutiny by a board 
of blockchain academics and experts (for face validity). In addition, we 
presented the developed items to three academics and five blockchain 
experts to see if their opinion was the same as that of the respondents. 
Pilot testing indicated a high degree of construct and content validity. 
The instrument developed consists of 26 items categorized into five 
constructs. Each item has a 7-point Likert scale for validation. We con-
sulted 291 blockchain technology consultants, blockchain marketing 
experts, and CEOs/business head of banks in India for validation. This 
instrument has an acceptable level of reliability. The analysis and results 
of this study indicate that the instrument to measure the business ben-
efits is highly reliable and demonstrate construct validity by accom-
plishing both convergent and discriminant validity. Our study 
contributes to both the theory and practice angles of blockchain tech-
nology in the banking industry. In terms of theory, our study delivers a 
validated instrument that aids managers in assessing the benefits of 
implementing blockchain in the banking sector. This instrument is 
explicitly crafted for the banking sector, though some of the benefits 
may be applicable to other sectors, as the study discusses benefits 
identified by working managers, experts, and researchers in the area of 
blockchain. The key points of the study are as follows: (i) it is of 
particular interest to acting managers/decision makers/experts to pro-
vide a foundational view to measure the business benefits of imple-
menting blockchain technology before they choose to integrate 
blockchain in their banking system, (ii) the combination of professional 
and theoretical use results in the communal and technical relevance of 
this study. Furthermore, blockchain can be designed to suit the needs of 
a banking eco-system that will further help optimize the cost of 
launching it. These needs can range from rising costs of transactions, 
fulfilling regulatory requirements, enhancing efficiency and security, 
and satisfying customer with quick and transparent services.
