While researchers have increasingly recognized the importance of information technology (IT) in leveraging a 
firm’s competitive strategy for achieving superior firm performance, our understanding of the nature of how a 
firm’s competitive strategy aligns with its industry IT strategic role and how such alignment influences firm 
performance remains limited. Drawing upon strategic alignment perspective, this study aims to theorize and 
empirically test how the firm’s competitive strategy (i.e., cost leadership, differentiation, and dual strategy) 
aligns with its industry IT strategic role to improve firm performance. Based on the data of Chinese publicly listed 
firms during 2009–2015, our results indicate that different competitive strategy aligns with different industry IT 
strategic roles for achieving superior performance. Specifically, cost leadership strategy aligns with automate IT 
strategic role, dual strategy aligns with informate IT strategic role, and differentiation strategy aligns with 
transform IT strategic role in generating superior firm performance. We also discuss the theoretical and practical 
implications of the current study.   


1. Introduction 


In response to the unique challenges of rapid changes and institu-
tional voids, firms operating in emerging economies need to make 
appropriate competitive strategy choices so as to generate superior firm 
performance (Li & Li, 2008; [1,2]). Within the dominant competitive 
strategy paradigm, cost leadership and differentiation have become the 
two fundamental strategies that firms can adopt to achieve a competitive 
advantage [3,4]. Specifically, cost leadership refers to the strategy that 
firms create a low-cost advantage relative to their peers to improve 
market share and achieve operational efficiency; differentiation refers to 
the strategy that firms differentiate their products/services that can 
satisfy a customer’s changeable demand and thus help achieve a 
competitive advantage that is not easy to be imitated by competitors [3, 
5–7]. However, controversy remains regarding the effectiveness of pure 
versus dual strategies, and the existing findings, particularly those 
derived from emerging economies, provide only limited and mixed un-
derstanding [8]. Increasingly, scholars have begun to shift their focus 


from trade-off (either/or) to paradoxical (both/and) thinking and have 
argued that a dual strategy that combines cost leadership and differen-
tiation can lead to better performance [9–11]. In particular, Gabrielsson 
et al. [8] indicate that “almost three decades of debate have not 
conclusively determined the conditions under which a firm can realize a 
combined ‘hybrid’ competitive strategy instead of a ‘single’ (or pure) 
generic competitive strategy of either differentiation or cost leadership.” 
It is thus of great significance and interest to examine the specific con-
ditions under which pure or dual strategy can contribute better perfor-
mance [12,13]. 


To resolve this debate, researchers have suggested that the effec-
tiveness of cost-leadership, differentiation, or dual strategy depends on 
the industry conditions in which they are implemented (Li et.al., 2008a). 
In particular, a group of scholars have recognized the importance of 
information technology (IT) when implementing their competitive 
strategy for superior performance [14–16], and IT-enabled initiatives 
are required to be considered in the context of other competitors’ 
IT-enabled actions in the same industry because it is not an isolated

event [17,18]. Under this condition, information systems researchers 
have proposed the conceptualization of industry IT strategic role, which 
refers to IT that may play a different role in different industry contexts 
[19,20]. Specifically, based on the different purpose of IT across in-
dustries, industry IT strategic role can be classified into three categories: 
automate, informate up/down, and transform [20]. This kind of industry 
classification determines the various types of IT required, the way of its 
application, and the extent of value produced and retained [21]. The 
strategic role of IT in certain industries reflects the main function that IT 
plays for firms’ competition across industries [22]. Prior research have 
highlighted the importance of alignment among different facets during 
firm operation, such as industry and business strategy [23,24]. There-
fore, the industry IT strategic role that brings structural changes across 
different industries might affect firms’ value capturing from specific 
competitive strategy [25,26]. Although industry IT strategic role has 
been applied to evaluate the role that IT serves in a firm, there is a dearth 
of research that explores how a firm chooses competitive strategy to 
improve firm performance in a different industry IT strategic role [27, 
19,8,20]. It is thus necessary to investigate whether and how a firm 
aligns its competitive strategy with its industry IT strategic role to 
achieve superior firm performance. 


Drawing upon the strategic alignment perspective (Henderson et al., 
1993), this study aims to explore how the alignment between a firm’s 
competitive strategy and industry IT strategic role affects firm perfor-
mance in an emerging economy, such as China. As China is the largest 
emerging economy in the world and its stunning rate of economic 
growth has made it become one of the most important markets in the 
world (Li et.al., 2008a); we thus used data from Chinese publicly listed 
firms during 2009–2015 to test the research model. Specifically, stra-
tegic alignment perspective suggests that a firm’s competitive strategy is 
only suitable in particular external conditions, and the well-aligned 
organization will acquire peak effectiveness [28]. Specifically, we pro-
pose and empirical test that a different competitive strategy type will 
have differential impact on firm performance under a different IT in-
dustry role. In doing so, our research contributes to the existing litera-
ture in two main ways. First, by integrating industry IT strategic role 
with the firms’ competitive strategy and further exploring their joint 
effects on firm performance, our study crystalizes the perspective of IT 
strategic role and competitive strategy and confirms the importance of 
the alignment of industry IT strategic role and competitive strategy in 
shaping superior firm performance. Although industry IT strategic role 
has been well documented in existing literature on a variety of topics 
such as IT investment (Banker, Feng, & Pavlou, 2011; [12,19,20]), 
previous research has not integrated industry IT strategic role with the 
firm’s competitive strategy to examine whether and how such alignment 
influences firm performance. Second, our research also enriches the 
existing research on how to configure appropriate competitive strategy 
from the perspective of industry IT strategic role. Generally, the 
empirical results of our study present a more nuanced understanding of 
the link between firm competitive strategy and firm performance under 
different industry IT strategic role in an emerging economy (i.e., China). 
In particular, our study shifts focus from which competitive strategy is 
effective to the context under which competitive strategy is effective, 
providing a comprehensive understanding of the effectiveness of 
different competitive strategies. 


The remainder of this paper is planned as follows. In the next section, 
we put forward our research model and develop our hypotheses. Next, 
we describe our data collection process and empirically test our hy-
potheses. Finally, we conclude our findings and discuss the contribu-
tions and limitations, as well as show some potential avenues for future 
research. 


2. Theoretical framework and literature review 


2.1. Competitive strategy 


Competitive strategy is one of the most important business strategies. 
The researchers who advocated Porter’s view have argued that firms are 
supposed to focus on pure strategy (either low cost or differentiation) to 
generate superior performance ([29]; Porter, 1985; [30]). Specifically, 
cost leadership strategy represents that firms need to create a low-cost 
advantage relative to their peers, whereas differentiation strategy rep-
resents that firms need to exploit products/services that can offer the 
firm to obtain a price premium, which is not easy to be imitated by 
competitors [5–7,31]. 


Prior studies have verified that competitive strategy has an impor-
tant impact on performance. However, it remains unknown which 
strategy firms can contribute to firm performance among differentiation, 
cost leadership, and dual strategy ([4]; Li et al., 2008a; [32]). Aulakh 
et al. [29] put forward that firms implementing a dual strategy is 
negatively related to firm export performance. However, using a sample 
of firms in Greece, Spanos et al. [11] find that a dual strategy is pref-
erable to pure strategies and pure differentiation strategies are less 
profitable. As such, it is still confusing for firms to select which kind of 
competitive strategy for achieving superior firm performance. In addi-
tion, the studies on dual strategy have mainly focused on the developed 
countries, such as the US [11]. Recently, the attention of dual strategy 
has gradually shifted to emerging markets with the increasing impor-
tance of developing countries in the world economy, such as China. 
Scholars have argued that the emerging economy (China) provides an 
interesting research background that explores both conventional 
research questions and distinct phenomenon to advance the literature 
[33]. On the one hand, China is the biggest emerging economy with the 
fastest speed of growing. The Chinese market is getting more and more 
competitive and firms need to take on an appropriate competitive 
strategy ([33]; Li, Poppo, & Zhou, 2008). On the other hand, China is in 
a transitional period with technological transformation and this phe-
nomenon posits a suitable research context to explore across different 
industries [34]. Moreover, scholars are also constantly exploring the 
boundary conditions of firm competitive strategy to enrich existing 
research, such as firm size, IT capability, and industry environment, and 
thus it is interesting to examine which competitive strategy in China can 
help achieve the goal of optimal performance [8,32]. 


2.2. Industry IT strategic role 


Chatterjee et al. [20] first proposed that industries can be divided 
into three categories based on the different strategic role that IT plays in 
the industry clearly: automate, informate, and transform. The industry 
IT strategic role describes the real function of IT in the industry (Arm-
strong et al., 1999). Specifically, in an automate industry, IT is used to 
replace expensive and unreliable human labor by automating business 
processes (e.g., metal manufacturing) (Armstrong et al., 1999). In the 
informate industry, IT can be used to provide and distribute data/-
information to empower management and employees more efficiently 
and easily (e.g., food services). IT not only helps firms improve opera-
tional efficiency, but also promotes the introduction and development of 
new products/services (Armstrong et al., 1999; Henderson et al., 1993). 
While in the transform industry, IT can fundamentally alter traditional 
ways of doing business and competition of the industry by redefining 
business processes and relationships (e.g., airlines) [20]. IT is viewed as 
a key driver and critical organizational resources of the firms’ devel-
opment (Armstrong et al., 1999). Indeed, quite a lot of researchers have 
agreed with this kind of category and have applied the industry IT 
strategic role to investigate how IT investment’s effect varies under a 
different industry IT strategy role [12,19]. As the strategic role of IT 
varies across different industries, it might also have an important role in 
shaping the firm’s business activities and competitive strategies (Chae 


J. Yin et al.

et al., 2018). However, our knowledge regarding how the effectiveness 
of different competitive strategies varies under different industry IT 
strategic role remains limited. 


2.3. Strategic alignment perspective 


The strategic alignment perspective outlines four topics of strategy 
decision for management: business strategy (including competitive 
strategy), IT strategy, organizational infrastructure and process, and 
information systems [35]. Given that IT has become a key tool for 
implementing business strategy [36], firms can adjust their strategies 
that can align with IT strategy and operate business with minimum fuss 
and maximum efficiency [37]. As such, the alignment of IT and business 
strategy has been a top concern for organizations to execute business 
[37,38]. IT-business strategic alignment can be defined as the level of 
integration and harmony between IT and business strategy when firms 
apply IT strategy in a proper and timely manner [39]. Researchers have 
paid increasing attention to the alignment between business strategy 
and IT strategy and have explored its impact on firm performance ([40]; 
Schniederjans et al., 2009). 


It is a critical issue to explore whether there is an alignment between 
the strategic application of IT and firm competitive strategy to attain an 
optimal organizational performance [37]. In this regard, most studies 
have investigated the performance effects of the strategic alignment 
([41–43]; Schniederjans et al., 2009; [13]). For example, Chan et al. 
[41] find that the strategic alignment positively affects firm innovation 
and market growth, but negatively affects firm reputation and financial 
performance. Yayla and Hu [13] analyze the impact of the strategic 
alignment on organizational performance, and they further suggest that 
strategic alignment has a positive impact on organizational performance 
in both developed and developing countries. Schniederjans and Cao [35] 
also find that IT-business alignment has a positive impact on firm per-
formance. Although there is a body of literature investigating the 
alignment between business strategy and IT strategy, it remains to be 
resolved whether and how competitive strategy aligns with industry IT 
strategic role as well as how such alignment influences firm perfor-
mance. ([2,36]; Yayla et al., 2012). 


2.4. Hypothesis development 


Drawing upon strategic alignment perspective, firms with alignment 
between IT and business strategies can generate a sustainable compet-
itive advantage [44]. According to this, we argue that a firm’s 
competitive strategy needs to align with its industry IT strategic role and 
such alignment can help the firm achieve superior firm performance. 
Specifically, we propose that cost leadership is the most important 
competitive strategy that the firm can adopt for achieving superior firm 
performance in the IT automate industry; dual strategy is the most 
important strategy that the firm is able to adopt for achieving superior 
firm performance in the IT informate industry; and differentiation is the 
most important competitive strategy that the firm in the IT transform 
industry can adopt for achieving superior firm performance. 


Specifically, in the automate industry, the role of IT is mainly used to 
replace expensive and unreliable human labor with automating business 
processes and improve the existing business activities’ efficiency 
(Armstrong et al., 1999; [19]). In particular, some routinized organi-
zational functions are substituted by automating processes enabled by IT 
[45]. The prevalent IT in automate industry is to support common 
standards, reduce cost, and promote operational efficiency (Armstrong 
et al., 1999; [46]). Meanwhile, such a kind of IT in the automate industry 
is standardized and easily accessible with spending minor cost [19]. 
Firms adopting a cost leadership strategy aim to provide customers with 
standard and a high-volume product at the most competitive prices. In 
contrast, firms pursuing a differentiation strategy strive to attract cus-
tomers by means of innovative products, good experience, advanced 
technology, and so on [47]. A dual strategy is a kind of compromise 


strategy, which means that firms pay attention to the cost of products 
while pursuing product differentiation, and firms want to form the ad-
vantages of high quality and low cost. Therefore, the IT function in the 
automate industry mismatches the goals of differentiation and dual 
strategy. 


Compared to differentiation and dual strategy, the prevalent IT in 
automate industry can help firms leverage the advantages of cost lead-
ership, which focuses on reducing costs through a simplified operation 
process and scale economies [31]. For example, the firms belonging to 
heavy construction need to accurately record and control costs in every 
step of the operations, and develop IT systems to simplify the opera-
tional process and save time. Meanwhile, the low price helps firms 
attract more customers. From the perspective of strategic alignment, the 
IT orientation in automate industry fits with the orientation of cost 
leadership strategy at the business level. Thus, for firms in the IT auto-
mate industry, cost leadership might be better aligned with the IT 
strategic role of the automate industry. As such, we hypothesize: 


Hypothesis 1. In the automate industry, cost leadership has a stronger 
impact on firm performance when compared with differentiation and 
dual strategy. 


In the IT informate industry, the main role of IT is to facilitate in-
formation flows to enhance decision-making and decision-taking activ-
ities, which involve both internal and external functions [20,17,24]. For 
the internal communication, IT helps distribute critical information 
across the internal functions more easily and efficiently. In the IT 
Informate industry, IT is regarded as a way to obtain information about 
firms’ operations, so that the timely communication will help firms 
achieve organizational cost control and coordination (Armstrong et al., 
1999). From the aspect of external business partnerships, the role of IT 
can help firms obtain timely market response to pinpoint problems and 
initiate corrective measures rapidly (Wade et al., 2004). In particular, 
effectively obtaining customers’ changeable requirements through IT 
can facilitate firms to develop new products continually (Armstrong 
et al., 1999; [45]). As such, IT in the informate industry can not only 
improve the internal production process to reduce costs, but also help 
firms differentiate their products to their competitors [48,49]. A cost 
leadership strategy pays attention to reduce cost and improve opera-
tional efficiencies internally while a differentiation strategy focuses on 
differentiating products to satisfy customers, and the two kinds of stra-
tegies do not match the function of IT in the informate industry (Li et al., 
2008a; [50]). 


Compared to firms with either pursuing cost leadership or differen-
tiation strategy, firms with dual strategy can exert more effectively due 
to facilitating information flow both within and across organizational 
boundaries supported by IT in the informate industry. For example, in 
the retail industry, Walmart stores which belong to the informate in-
dustry, have used IT to redesign key business processes that affect their 
capability to manage the North American distribution channels of 
products. As a result, Walmart stores obtain significant improvements in 
operating costs and increased the speed to respond to market re-
quirements (Henderson et al., 1993). Meanwhile, with the help of IT, 
efficient distribution information channels can help timely collect and 
analyze customer information and feedback, which facilitates the Wal-
mart to more effectively provide customers with various personalized 
products/services. For example, based on customer and market feed-
back, Walmart stores distinguish between different customer groups for 
targeted sales. Based on the strategic alignment perspective, the IT 
orientation in the informate industry, which is aligned with the business 
orientation of dual strategy (focus on both cost and product differenti-
ation) can create superior performance. Thus, for firms in the IT infor-
mate industry, firms which adopt a dual strategy combing cost 
leadership and differentiation might better align with the IT strategic 
role of informate industry for achieving superior performance. There-
fore, we expect: 


J. Yin et al.

Hypothesis 2. In the informate industry, dual strategy has a stronger 
impact on firm performance when compared with cost leadership and 
differentiation. 


In the IT transform industry, the implementation of IT is imperative 
and proactive (Henderson et al., 1993). Generally, the role of IT in the 
transform industry is to introduce radically different technologies that 
can make firms abandon obsolete business processes. Under this in-
dustry, IT enables major innovations in products, services, and business 
models due to fundamentally changing the relationship between busi-
ness and market (Armstrong et al., 1999). In particular, the use of IT can 
redefine existing organizational activities and create a new business that 
can change industry standards. In addition, the role of IT in the trans-
form industry can help firms continually better develop various new 
products/services that can evenly exceed the customers’ expectations. A 
growing slice of expenditure in IT is devoted to product development 
rather than making existing production more efficient in the transform 
industry [49]. The purposes of cost leadership and dual strategy is not 
aligned with the prevalent IT in transform industry. Firms implementing 
a dual or cost leadership strategy are unable to take advantage of the IT 
resources provided by the transform industry and will result in a waste 
of resources and inefficiency. 


Compared to cost leadership and dual strategy, differentiation 
strategy focus more on innovation and superior customer service, which 
need more advanced IT for better research and development which 
cannot be imitated by competitors (Wade et al., 2004). The advanced IT 
in the transform industry can support firms to differentiate products and 
develop new technologies more easily (Li et al., 2008a). For instance, in 
the financial banking industry, IT leads to substantial structural changes 
of the industry and plays a critical role. Banks, thus, have been devel-
oping a website or an online application to provide customers with in-
formation and financial services that help the banks to differentiate their 
products/services to their competitors [51]. According to the strategic 
alignment perspective, the fit between the IT orientation of transform 
industry and the business orientation of differentiation strategy can 
generate the competitive advantage. Thus, for firms in the transform 
industry, differentiation strategy is aligned with the IT strategic role of 
transform industry so as to generate superior firm performance. Hence, 
we propose: 


Hypothesis 3. In the transform industry, differentiation has a stronger 
impact on firm performance when compared with cost leadership and 
dual strategy. 


3. Methodology 


3.1. Sample and data collection 


We conducted our research against the background of the largest 
developing economy, namely, China. Meanwhile, small and medium- 
sized and growth firms need to pay more attention to their decision- 
making under intense competition in the emerging economy, because 
they need to allocate their limited resources appropriately. Therefore, 
we collected archival data that can represent our independent and 
dependent variables from the China Stock Market and Accounting 
Research Database (CSMAR) from 2009 to 2015 on Small and Medium- 
sized Enterprises Market and Growth Enterprises Market to test our 
hypotheses. CSMAR provides structured financial reports, trading quo-
tations, unstructured news, research reports, firms’ announcement in-
formation and so on for academic research in China. CSMAR is one of the 
most influential financial database in China and contains all financial 
information of listed firms in China, and have been recognized in pre-
vious research [52,53]. To reduce the risks of reverse causality, we 
measured firm performance after firms had conducted a competitive 
strategy, and measured the impact of competitive strategy using 
one-year lags [54]. At first, during 2009–2015, we acquired the financial 
information of 1279 publicly listed firms and 6696 observations from 


CSMAR database. In the process of data processing, we eliminated the 
missing observations because firms do not report financial information 
that we need. At the same time, we also excluded missing matching 
samples due to one-year lags of independent and control variables. 
Then, we need to clarify these firms according to its role of IT and 
excluded the observations, which do not belong to this classification [19, 
20]. Finally, we obtained 926 firms and 4044 observations from 2009 to 
2015. Because the purpose of this paper is to find how a firm’s 
competitive strategy aligns with its industry IT strategic role to improve 
firm performance, we divided the total sample into three subsamples: 
automate, informate, and transform industry. Then, we conducted a 
comparative analysis among subsamples to find the best alignment be-
tween competitive strategy and industry IT strategy role. Furthermore, 
we viewed industry IT strategic role as dummy variables to do a hier-
archical regression analysis, which examined the moderating effect of 
industry IT strategic role. Chatterjee et al. [20] developed a method to 
classify IT strategic role and then Chae et al. [19] used the same way to 
access the strategic role of IT. Accordingly, we used the latest classifi-
cation results to obtain our three subsamples. Table 1 shows the distri-
bution of the industry IT strategic role in the sample. 


3.2. Measurements 


3.2.1. Differentiation strategy 
Differentiation strategy refers to firms that provide products with 


unique or superior features that appeal to customers. Differentiation 
strategy focuses on the development of new designs, innovative research 
and development, customer satisfaction, and brand image [55]. Firms 
adopting the differentiation strategy are able to show a high profit 
margin, because differentiation can help firms fulfill a price premium for 
their superior products/service or greater customer value [31]. Thus, we 
used profit margin ratio of firms to measure the differentiation strategy 
[31,56]. 


3.2.2. Cost leadership strategy 
Cost leadership aims at selling the cheapest unit price product in 


their industry [55,57], p. 35) indicated that “cost leadership requires 
aggressive construction of efficient-scale facilities, vigorous pursuit of 
cost reduction from experience, tight cost and overhead control and cost 
minimization in areas like R&D, service, sales force, advertising, and so 
on.” Therefore, firms require to utilize their assets efficiently and main 
lean operations to achieve cost leadership and maintain their competi-
tive advantages as cost leaders [3]. Thus, we used the asset turnover 
ratio of firms to capture this strategy [31]. 


3.2.3. Dual strategy 
Dual strategy refers to firms that not only focus on cost control and 


save, but also consider how to develop a new product/service to create 
customer demand. These firms usually adopt differentiation and cost 
leadership simultaneously in the process of operation [58]. According to 
the definition, we used the product of asset turnover ratio and profit 
margin ratio as the operationalization of dual strategy. 


3.2.4. Industry IT strategic role 
Industry IT strategic role was divided into three categories based on 


the different roles that IT plays in the industry. Chae et al. (2018, p. 8) 
put forward that “the construct of the strategic role of IT for an industry 
has been used to understand the impact of IT on a firm’s business

activities and competitive strategies.” Accordingly, this study describes 
the industry classification using the industry information developed 
from Chae et al. [19]. Thus, we used the result to divide our samples into 
automate, informate, and transform industry as shown in Table 2. 


3.2.5. Firm performance 
The measures of firm performance require to show the effectiveness 


of the firm’s action to achieve the firm’s goals [59]. Firm financial 
performance indicators based on accounting reflect the final results of 
the managers’ strategy decisions, thus, this kind of measures are pref-
erable to market-based performance measures, which are more suscep-
tible to uncontrollable factors when exploring the impact of competitive 
strategy on firm performance [60]. Following prior studies (Stoel et al., 
2009; Palmer et al., 2000), we utilized return on assets (ROA) infor-
mation from archival data to capture firm financial performance. ROA is 
a useful indicator of measuring firm profitability relative to its total 
assets [58]. Meanwhile, to demonstrate the robustness of our results 
using different measurements of firm performance, we utilized return on 
equity (ROE) measurement as the ratio of profit to equity as the per-
formance measure for robustness check [61]. 


3.2.6. Control variables 
To exclude the impact of other factors, we controlled the firm and 


industry level variables, which may affect firm performance: (1) firm 
size: the natural logarithm of total assets [62,63]; (2) firm capital 
expenditure: the natural logarithm of the cash paid by the firm for the 
purchase and construction of fixed assets, intangible assets, and other 
long-term assets [64]; (3) fixed asset: the ratio of fixed assets to total 
assets at the end of the year [65]; and (4) firm leverage: the ratio of total 
liabilities to total assets at the end of the year [64]; (5) industry con-
centration: the Herfindahl index, which equals the sum of the squared 
market share of each firm in the same industry [66]. 


4. Analysis and results 


Table 3 reports the descriptive statistics and correlation matrix for 
variables applied in this paper. The variance inflation factor (VIF) test 
shows that all VIF values are below 2.1 with an average of 1.57. The 
results indicate that multicollinearity is not a concern in the regression 
analysis. We minimized possible collinearity by centering all pertinent 
independent variables and creating the interaction terms by multiplying 
them [67]. Before we performed a regression analysis to test the hy-
potheses, we confirmed whether we should use a fixed-effect or a 
random regression model. Our study has three subsamples, period “T” of 
seven years and the number of three subsamples are 245, 3252, and 547 
(N), respectively. We performed the Hausman test in the total sample 
and every subsample (Total sample: chi2 = 357.51, p < 0.001; Auto-
mate: chi2 = 16.01, p < 0.05; Informate: chi2 = 368.46, p < 0.001; and 
Transform: chi2 = 30.67, p < 0.001) and the results show that we should 


adopt the fixed-effect estimation model [68]. Next, because the 
fixed-effect estimation model may include not only an individual fixed 
effect, but also time fixed effect, we examined the joint salience of 
annual dummy variables to determine whether time effects should be 
controlled in the model and the results show that the model should 
contain year effects. Therefore, we used annual dummy variables as 
control variables in our model. We then estimated the following model: 
(
Firm performance


)
i,t+1 = αi,t + β1firm sizei,t + β2capital expenditurei,t


+ β3fixed asseti,t + β4firm leveragei,t
+ β5industry concentrationi,t
+ β6differentiationi,t + β7cost leadershipi,t
+ β8dual strategyi,t + YearEffectsi,t + εi,t  


Where i stands for the firm and varies from 1 to N in every subsample; 
t is the year and varies from 2009 to 2015; 
αi,t is the constant; 
β1 - β8 are the coefficients in the regression; 
εi,t is the residual variable that varies with time. 
Using the model, we tested our hypothesis, and the results of three 


subsamples are presented in Table 4. To test which competitive strategy 
has the strongest positive impact on firm performance under different 
industry IT strategic role, we compared the significant coefficients be-
tween specific competitive strategy and firm performance. 


In the automate industry, we hypothesized that cost leadership 
strategy has a stronger positive impact on firm performance, and the 
result of Model 1a shown in Table 4 and the results supported this hy-
pothesis. In Model 1a, the results showed that cost leadership signifi-
cantly positively affects firm performance (β7 = 0.091 and p < 0.05), 
while differentiation was insignificantly related to firm performance 
(β6=-0.121 and p > 0.10). Moreover, dual strategy was found to be 
significantly negatively related to firm performance (β8=-1.384 and p <
0.01). Then, we conducted the comparison analysis, and the results 
indicated that cost leadership has a stronger impact on firm performance 
in the automate industry as compared to differentiation and dual strat-
egy (ΔT1 = 43.343). This result suggested that the alignment between 
cost leadership strategy and automate IT strategic role has a stronger 
impact on firm performance. 


For the informate industry, we hypothesized that dual strategy has a 
stronger positive impact on firm performance and the result of Model 2a 
displayed in Table 4. In Model 2a, the results presented that dual 
strategy positively affects firm performance significantly (β8 = 0.834 
and p < 0.01), whereas differentiation strategy does not significantly 
affect firm performance (β6=-0.002 and p > 0.10) and cost leadership is 
positively related to firm performance at the significant level of 0.1 (β7 
= 0.012 and p < 0.10). The results of the comparison analysis further 
showed that dual strategy in the informate industry has a stronger 
impact on firm performance as compared to cost leadership and differ-
entiation (ΔT2 = 171.926). This result suggests that dual strategy was 
aligned with informate IT strategy role to generate superior firm per-
formance and supported hypothesis 2. 


For the transform industry, we hypothesized that the differentiation 
strategy has a stronger positive impact on firm performance and the 
result of Model 3a shown in Table 4. In Model 3a, the results showed that 
only differentiation has a significant positive impact on firm perfor-
mance (β6 = 0.259 and p < 0.05), while the coefficients of cost lead-
ership and dual strategy is insignificant (β7 = 0.008, p > 0.10 and β8 =
0.520, p > 0.10). This result suggested that the differentiation strategy is 
better aligned with transform IT strategy role to improve firm perfor-
mance and supported hypothesis 3.

5. Post hoc analysis 


5.1. Robustness check 


To further confirm the results, we also conducted three additional 
robustness checks. First, we used ROE as an alternative dependent var-
iable to do a robust check and the results were also displayed in Table 4. 
In Models 1b, 2b, and 3b, the relationship between competitive strategy 
and industry IT strategic role are the same as the relationship in Models 
1a, 2a and 3a (Model 1b: β6=-0.418, p > 0.10; β7 = 0.173, p < 0.05; 
β8=-3.256, p < 0.10; Model 2b: β6=-0.696, p > 0.10; β7=-0.129, p >
0.10; β8 = 1.212, p > 0.10; Model 3b: β6 = 0.233, p > 0.10; β7 = 0.001, 
p < 0.10; and β8 = 0.197, p > 0.10). Although the coefficients in Model 
2b and Model 3b is insignificant, the relationship is still positive as the 
main results. 


Second, to confirm the robustness of our results, we also used in-
dustry dummy variables as moderators to examine the interactions be-
tween three types of industry IT strategic role and three types of 
competitive strategies. Then, the results were consistent with the main 
results. We presented this result in Table 5. The results in Table 5 
revealed that the direct effect of differentiation and cost leadership 
strategy on firm performance is absent, while the direct effect of dual 
strategy is significantly positive (β = 0.717 and p < 0.01). Then, we 
added interaction terms in Model 2, Model 3, and Model 4 gradually. In 
Model 2, the results provided evidence to support the moderating effect 
of automate industry proposed under H1. Specifically, the interaction of 
automate IT industry strategic role and cost leadership strategy is 
positively related to firm performance (β = 0.090 and p < 0.01). The 
results shown in Model 3 and Model 4 also provided evidence to support 
the moderating effect of informate and transform IT industry strategic 
role proposed under H2 and H3. The alignment of informate industry 
and dual strategy had a positive impact on firm performance (β = 1.138 
and p < 0.05) and the alignment of transform industry and 


differentiation strategy also exists (β = 0.303 and p < 0.10). 
Finally, considering the financial halo effect, we controlled the cur-


rent year’s ROA (ROE for robust check) to eliminate the potential bias 
due to prior firm performance. Because of this dynamic panel model, we 
applied a generalized method of moments (GMM) to obtain our results

[69]. The results are shown in Table 6. In Model 1a, Model 2a, and 
Model 3a, the results totally supported our hypothesis. The coefficients 
are significant only when the competitive strategy is aligned with the 
specific industry IT strategic role. Specifically, cost leadership is posi-
tively related to firm performance in the automate industry (Model 1a: 
β7 = 0.159 and p < 0.10) and dual strategy is positively significant in the 
informate industry (Model 2a: β8 = 1.365 and p < 0.05), and the dif-
ferentiation has a significantly positive impact on firm performance in 
the transform industry (Model 3a: β6 = 0.814 and p < 0.01). Then, we 
also used ROE as the alternative measurement of the dependent vari-
able, the results of Model 1b and Model 3b are consistent (Model 1b: β7 
= 0.451, p < 0.05; and Model 3b: β6 = 1.895, p < 0.05), while the 
coefficient of dual strategy is insignificant in Model 2b (Model 2b: 
β8=-9.698 and p > 0.10). These generally consistent results further 
demonstrate the robustness of our conclusions. Based on the empirical 
analysis, the hypotheses of our study were generally confirmed and the 
results suggested that the alignment between firms’ competitive strategy 
and the industry IT strategy role could significantly improve firm 
performance. 


5.2. Endogeneity test 


Omitted, correlated variables or reverse causality may cause a wrong 
observed association between competitive strategic and firm perfor-
mance. To examine the possibility that competitive strategy is deter-
mined exogenously, we conduct the standard Durbin-Wu-Hausman 
method to verify that endogeneity is not a matter of concern in our study 
[70]. Specifically, because firm size, firm capital expenditure, firm fixed 
asset, firm leverage, industry concentration, and industry IT strategic 
role are not directly related to firm performance in our empirical results, 
we adopted these variables as instrumental variables to do the endo-
geneity test. Therefore, we regress cost leadership and differentiation 
strategy on firm size, firm capital expenditure, firm fixed asset, firm 
leverage, industry concentration, and industry IT strategic role, 
respectively. Then, we compute the residual, η1 and η2 of the two re-
gressions. Finally, we add η1 and η2 as variables in the main regressive 
equation and reran the research model. The parameter estimate for the 
two residuals were insignificant (β = 0.634, p > 0.30 and β = 0.159, p >
0.50), and the results suggested that competitive strategy is exogenous 
in our context. 


6. Discussion 


Drawing upon strategic alignment perspective, this study aims to 
investigate whether and how a firm’s competitive strategy aligns with its 


industry IT strategic role and how such alignment influences firm 
financial performance. By collecting archival data from 2009 to 2015 in 
China, we classified the total sample into three subsamples (automate/ 
informate/transform) according to the industry IT strategic role [19,20]. 
In each subsample, we conduct an empirical analysis and the results 
generally support our hypotheses. In addition, we examine the moder-
ating effect of industry IT strategic role and these results confirm our 
findings. First, we proposed hypothesis 1 that IT in automate industry 
helps firms to save costs, which is consistent with the purposes of cost 
leadership. Our results confirm that there is an alignment between cost 
leadership strategy and IT strategic role in the IT automate industry. 
Meanwhile, we also find that dual strategy has a significantly negative 
association with firm performance in the automate industry. A possible 
explanation is that the prevalent main function of IT in the automate 
industry cannot help firms achieve the goals of both cost leadership and 
differentiation strategy (i.e., dual strategy) [22]. Moreover, the mis-
matching of competitive strategy with industry IT strategic role will 
require the firm to invest more resources; however, this kind of invest-
ment in the automate industry may not bring corresponding profits. In 
automate industry, such as coal mining, product differentiation does not 
increase consumer demand effectively. As such, it is not worthy for firms 
in the automate industry to adopt both cost leadership and differentia-
tion strategy through improving IT capabilities. This finding further 
confirms that it is important for firms to align their competitive strategy 
with its industry IT strategic role. 


Second, we put forward hypothesis 2 that IT in informate industry 
can not only help firms differentiate products, but also improve opera-
tional efficiency, and the results indicate that the dual strategy is aligned 
with the main purpose of IT in the informate industry. These kinds of 
firms can use IT appropriately to simplify the production process and 
constantly introduce a new product [48]. For instance, more and more 
young people prefer to customize their own furniture to display their 
personality, but they do not have too much consumption capacity 
because of the too high housing price and low salary in China as 
compared to the developed country [71]. They prefer to buy a good 
looking and affordable product. Therefore, furniture manufacturers 
need to commit to providing customers with affordable and distinctive 
furniture. 


Finally, the empirical results also confirm our hypothesis 3 that 
differentiation strategy aligns with the role of IT in the transform in-
dustry. IT in the transform industry is to change the firm’s fundamental 
relationships with external partnerships and alter the markets, products, 
organizational structures, inter-organizational relationships, and so on. 
Firms in the IT transform industry face intense competition and some 
advanced IT have also fundamentally transformed the industry. Under

this condition, firms in the transform industry can develop differentia-
tion strategy to better utilize the advanced IT in the transform industry 
to better meet the customers changing requirements. 


6.1. Theoretical contributions and practical implications 


This study provides two main theoretical contributions to the exist-
ing literature. First, this study points to the critical function of industry 
IT strategic role as an important conditional factor in developing and 
examining the impact of competitive strategies. This contingency model 
adds knowledge to the relationship between competitive strategy and 
firm performance. More importantly, industry IT strategic role provides 
a new perspective to explore the impact of pure/dual competitive 
strategy on firm performance [28,14]. Second, our study demonstrates 
that the link between competitive strategy and firm performance are 
more complex than previously theorized [12,19,20,31]. Particularly, the 
impact of dual strategy on firm performance appear to be significantly 
positive, while differentiation and cost leadership strategy are insignif-
icant in the full sample. These results suggest that we need to consider 
the other conditional factor to unveil the mechanism of competitive 
strategy. This study extends strategy management literature by further 
substantiating the relationship between both pure/dual strategies and 
firm performance. By adopting the strategic alignment perspective, our 
study argues and empirically tests whether and how a firm’s competitive 
strategy aligns with its industry IT strategic role. Our results provide the 
empirical support for the existence and nature of the alignment between 
competitive strategy and industry IT strategy role. In addition to the 
findings of the alignment between competitive strategy and industry IT 
strategic role, we also find that the effect of dual strategy in automate 
industry appear to be significantly negative. This result demonstrates 
that the mismatch between the firm’s competitive strategy and its in-
dustry IT strategic role can indeed undermine firm performance. 


From the view of practical implications, our findings remind man-
agers that they need to recognize the strategic importance of industry IT 
strategic role when developing an appropriate competitive strategy for 
achieving superior firm performance. Managers might use our research 
results as a guideline to utilize the alignment tactics between industry IT 
strategic role and competitive strategy to achieve superior firm perfor-
mance. Different industry IT strategic roles enable firms achieve goals of 
different competitive strategies. Managers need to consider the impact 
of industry IT strategic role and try their best to exploit the possibilities 
offered by the specific industry IT strategic role to align with competi-
tive strategy. Specifically, with the help of prevalent IT function in the 
automate industry, firms can more easily achieve the strategic goal of 
cost leadership to improve firm performance because of the alignment 
between industry IT strategic role and competitive strategy. Moreover, 
dual strategy in the automate industry can result in the decrease of firm 
performance because of the misalignment. In IT transform industry, 
managers can develop new products by leveraging advanced IT in the 
industry to keep up with industry transformation. When a firm belongs 
to informate industry, it indicates that the firm can more easily establish 
competitive advantages of dual strategy under this the kind of industry 
IT strategic role. For example, the IKEA group, the world’s largest home 
products retailer, not only shows their furniture’s information online 
and collect customers’ preference through internet to differentiate their 
products, but also reduces inventory costs and facilitates transportation 
by using flat packaging. This helps IKEA form competitive advantages 
and attract more customers who want to purchase favorite products at 
affordable prices [72]. 


Moreover, our findings not only help managers recognize that 
alignment between competitive strategy and industry IT strategic role 
could help generate better performance, but also remind managers to 
realize that the misalignment between competitive strategy and industry 
IT strategic role may deteriorate firm performance, such as developing 
the dual strategy in the automate industry. For instance, the Ford Motor 
Company used to only focus on achieving the lowest costs and ignored 


customers’ demand; however, this type of competitive strategy makes it 
bear heavy losses by competitors [73]. Besides, some firms may confront 
the challenges of the transformation period because of the industry 
environment with intense competition [19]. Thus, they need to obtain 
some information of the industry in which they are ready to participate, 
such as industry IT strategic role, and adjust their competitive strategy 
timely to adapt to new industry environment. Another example is the 
music and media industry, which has become more and more digitalized 
to differentiate products/service rather than reducing costs. Providing 
diversified products/service online is at the heart of firms in this in-
dustry to improve customer experience and command premium prices 
[49]. 


6.2. Limitations and future research 


There are several limitations in our study, which provide some di-
rections for future research. One limitation of our study is the classifi-
cation of automate, informate, and transform industry. We can only 
obtain the classification based on Chae et al. [19] and the year of 2007 is 
the latest criteria for this classification. Therefore, one direction for 
future research is to develop a finer measure of this important variable 
(Dehning et al., 2003). Another limitation is that we only integrate IT 
strategic role of industry with competitive strategy because of the data 
limitation. Industry IT strategic role is a coarse metric to measure the IT 
usage in the industry. This variable can reflect the IT status of the in-
dustry, but each firm’s ability to utilize IT is different. Moreover, 
although we argue that in certain industry, if specific IT is imperative for 
the industry, the firms in the industry need to also develop their IT 
aggressively to compete in the industry (Chae et al., 2018). However, 
firms may choose a different IT strategy such as IT innovator and IT 
conservative, even they are in the same industry IT strategic role. 
Therefore, future research can investigate the IT-business alignment 
deeply and consider how a firm’s competitive strategies align with its 
specific IT strategies and industry IT strategic role [19]. In addition, this 
study can be extended by containing additional contingency factors, 
including external and internal factors. For example, future research can 
consider the impact of firm characteristics at the internal level, such as 
firm size and the quality of IT governance [12]. The external environ-
ment such as industry dynamism can also be considered in future 
research. 


7. Conclusion 


By echoing the perspective from strategic alignment, our study 
provides insights into the alignment between the firms’ competitive 
strategy and their industry IT strategic role and how such alignment 
influences firm performance. Our findings show that the three compet-
itive strategies can play different roles under various IT strategic roles. 
Specifically, we find that cost leadership strategy has a significantly 
stronger positive association with firm performance in the automate 
industry. For the informate industry, firms can choose a dual strategy to 
improve firm performance. Finally, firms that belong to the transform 
industry can use the differentiation strategy to improve firm perfor-
mance. Our findings provide a more nuanced understanding of the ex-
istence and nature of the alignment between competitive strategy and 
industry IT strategic role and call for more research to explore the 
interaction between industry IT strategic role and other firm strategic 
decisions, such as innovation orientation and IT governance strategies.
