Blockchain Technology (BT) has led to a disruption in the supply chain by removing the trust related issues.
Studies are being conducted worldwide to leverage the benefits provided by BT in improving the performance of
the supply chains. The literature reveals BT to offer various benefits leading to improvements in the sustainable
performance of the agriculture supply chains (ASC). It is expected that BT will bring a paradigm shift in the way
the transactions are carried in the ASC by reducing the high number of intermediaries, delayed payments and
high transaction lead times. India, a developing economy, caters to the food security needs of an ever-growing
population and faces many challenges affecting ASC sustainability. It is therefore essential to adopt BT in the
ASC to leverage the various benefits. In this study, we identify and establish the relationships between the
enablers of BT adoption in ASC. Thirteen enablers were identified from the literature and validated by the
experts before applying a combined Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) and Decision-Making Trial and
Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) methodology to envision the complex causal relationships between the
identified BT enablers. The findings from the study suggest that, among the identified enablers, traceability was
the most significant reason for BT implementation in ASC followed by auditability, immutability, and prove-
nance. The findings of the study will help the practitioners to design the strategies for BT implementation in
agriculture, creating a real-time data-driven ASC. The results will also help the policymakers in developing
policies for faster implementation of BT ensuring food safety and sustainable ASCs.


1. Introduction


The agriculture supply chain (ASC) is like any consumer product
supply chain that includes the suppliers, leading firms, customers, and
distribution partners. The primary difference is that either animals or
humans consume the final products, and the raw material is grown in
farms using agricultural practices (Miranda-Ackerman & Azzaro-Pantel,
2017). In the recent past, the agriculture sector is receiving prominent
importance to achieve sustainable growth that is inclusive of best
agricultural practices, social well-being of the involved stakeholders
and environmental protection (Castro & Swart, 2017; Dentoni &
Peterson, 2011). The ASC is under severe pressure from various con-
sumer organizations, social and environmental activists, agro-based
companies and policymakers to achieve sustainability (Allaoui, Guo,
Choudhary, & Bloemhof, 2018). Luthra, Mangla, Chan, and Venkatesh
(2018)) identified a low level of industrialization, inefficient supply
chain management, lack of managerial skills and fragmented informa-
tion sharing leading to low supply chain visibility as the main problems
of ASC. Naik and Suresh (2018) claim that to have sustainable devel-
opment; the ASC should ensure the involvement of farmers and


suppliers and take initiatives to meet the stringent food safety and
quality regulations. Emerging technologies such as internet of services
(IoS), internet of things (IoT) and cloud computing (CC) are supporting
the decision making in supply chains leading to performance im-
provement (Ahumada & Villalobos, 2009). These technologies are
helping the ASC to manage the demand-supply variations, stringent
food safety norms and other sustainability requirements (Wang & Yue,
2017; Verdouw, Beulens, Reijers, & van der Vorst, 2015). Blockchain
technology (BT) is expected to be a significant contributor to the ASC by
bringing substantial improvements in the level of accountability,
transparency, and traceability by maintaining information power
symmetry across all the supply chain partners (Bronson & Knezevic,
2016; Carbonell, 2016). A BT based data management systems in an
ASC can act as a significant boost for the sector to manage the land and
use records, purchase details and use of farm equipment, seeds, pesti-
cides, traceability and financial transactions across the entire ASC
(Maru et al., 2018). These benefits will help the ASC to reduce the in-
creasing cases of product adulteration and frauds thereby, improving
sustainability. BT can act as the digital layer providing reliable and
trustworthy information on the origin and provenance of farm products

(Ge et al., 2017).
India is considered as an agrarian powerhouse and is the world’s


second largest fruits and vegetable producer accounting for 10.9 per-
cent and 8.6 percent of the world fruit and vegetable production (FAO
Report, 2017). The Indian ASC face the issue of meeting the demands of
the evergrowing population, poor infrastructure used for preserving the
horticultural crops, and quality issues leading to annual food losses to
the tune of 40 percent (Ritchie, Reay, & Higgins, 2018). The other
problems faced by them is the high number of intermediaries leading to
delayed payments and high transaction lead times (Balaji & Arshinder,
2016). Furthermore, the consumers are becoming more concern about
the product quality and use of safe agricultural practices, thereby put-
ting pressure on the ASC’s to adopt responsible sourcing on the agro-
based organizations (Yawar & Kauppi, 2018). The current literature on
blockchain focuses on the opportunities, benefits, and challenges it
offers to the existing supply chain, using literature review methodology
(Angelis & Ribeiro da Silva, 2019; Saberi, Kouhizadeh, & Sarkis, 2018;
Wang, Han, & Beynon-Davies, 2019; Hughes, Rana, & Dwivedi, 2019;
Hughes, Dwivedi et al., 2019).


Further, few studies have focused on analyzing the important be-
havioral dimensions that affect the blockchain adoption in the supply
chain (Kamble, Gunasekaran, & Arha, 2019; Queiroz & Wamba, 2019;
Francisco and Swanson, 2018). The supply chain managers, never-
theless are not provided with any decision-making framework on how
to adopt blockchain or to inform them about the enablers. As BT is an
emerging technology and relatively new in the Indian context it is es-
sential for the practitioners in the ASC to identify the enablers of the BT
adoption and understand how they are inter-related with each other
and to what extent they can address the above problems. The re-
lationship between the enablers will help the ASC practitioners to
convince the organizations to adopt BT in their supply chains to address
the issue of sustainability. Therefore, in the present study, we identified
factors that enable the BT adoption in the supply chain based on extant
literature review and insights received from ASC practitioners. This was
followed by the use of a combined interpretive structural modeling
(ISM) and decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL)
methodology to establish hierarchical levels and relationships between
the selected enablers. The findings of the study suggest how the ASC
practitioners and policymakers must take important initiatives on en-
abling a BT driven ASC in India. The remaining of the paper is orga-
nized as follows: section 2 presents a literature review on BT, ASC and
identifies the enablers of BT. The research methodology is presented in
section 3. Section 4 presents the application of ISM-DEMATEL metho-
dology in modeling the enablers of BT in the ASC. Section 5 presents the
discussion on the findings and section 6 presents the conclusions,
managerial implications, and limitations of the study.


2. Literature review


The researchers carried an extant literature review of articles pub-
lished in Web of Science and Scopus to get insights on BT adoption in
ASCs. The primary search keywords included the terms “blockchain
adoption” or “blockchain implementation.” The search generated 45
research papers. The second set of keywords were focused on selecting
papers that dealt with blockchain in ASC and included the search terms;
“blockchain” and “agriculture supply chain” or “food supply chain.”
The search criteria produced additionally 20 papers. The search was
performed in April 2019 without any time restrictions. We also re-
viewed a few industry reports, news articles, and trade magazines from
different internet sources to get additional insights on the selected
topic. The review of literature is presented into six subsections viz.
overview of BT, the value proposition offered by BT, BT adoption in
logistics and supply chain management, BT in the ASC, the BT enablers
(BTE) and managerial challenges for BT adoption.


2.1. Blockchain technology


“Blockchain technology” (BT) is becoming one of the most pro-
mising technologies of the new economy. Also known as, the “dis-
tributed ledger technology,” the BT market size is expected to grow to
USD 7,683.7 million by 2022, at a compound annual growth rate of
79.6% (Singh, 2018). The vast market potential of BT has taken over
the business world by a storm, gaining increased attention from both
researchers and industry practitioners (Kamble et al., 2019). BT is ex-
pected to transform the traditional ways of performing transactions
leading to its applications in a variety of potential areas (Wang et al.,
2019). BT employs a distributed (Hofmann, Strewe, & Bosia, 2018;
Saberi et al., 2018) and decentralized database (Kouhizadeh & Sarkis,
2018) which is publicly accessible, ensuring a high level of integrity for
all the transactions happening on the blockchain network (Nakamoto,
2008). BT is a digital database, which can hold any form of information
such as transactions, records, and events with defined rules for in-
formation updates (Sikorski, Haughton, & Kraft, 2017). The network
continuously grows in the form of blocks, as more transactions (in-
formation and data) are added. As the blocks add-on, the system de-
velops and these blocks link and form a chain using a hash. In the
context of a data structure, a blockchain network is an ordered list of
blocks, which contain transactions, smart-contract creation, and in-
vocations (Nakamoto, 2008). As BT provides a general-purpose pro-
gramming infrastructure, application specific programs that control the
transfer of currencies based on predefined functions or smart contracts
can be run on a blockchain network (Ouaddah, Elkalam, & Ouahman,
2017). BT eliminates the role of a third party or an intermediary to
control and overlook the system. Instead, it deploys a transparent
consensus mechanism which ensures that only valid transactions are
executed (Nakamoto, 2008; Bocek & Stiller, 2018). All operations are
visible to the participants in the network, and therefore, BT prevents
participants’ malicious activities.


2.2. The value proposition of Blockchain in supply chains


Supply chain management is defined by the Council of Supply Chain
Management Professionals as “the planning and management of all
activities involved in sourcing and procurement, conversion and all
logistics management activities. Importantly, it also includes co-
ordination and collaboration with channel partners, which can be
suppliers, intermediaries, third-party service providers, and customers”
(CSCMP, 2019). Supply chain management is a promising area for BT
applications (Kamble et al., 2019). BT adoption in the supply chain
enhances visibility and transparency by eliminating trust related issues.
The critical factors for any logistics and supply chain organizations are
transparency and traceability (Shankar, Gupta, & Pathak, 2018). The
primary challenge of the traditional supply chain is the shortage of an
open and trustworthy information resource across the supply chain
(Wang et al., 2019). Benefits of BT includes the broader participation of
stakeholders, lower transaction costs, reduced lead times resulting in
increased efficiency. Some of the most prominent features of BT are a
consensus mechanism (Nakamoto, 2008), provenance (Kshetri, 2018),
auditability (Zheng, Xie, Dai, Chen, & Wang, 2017), immutability
(Underwood, 2016), and traceability (Kim & Laskowski, 2018). BT
applications are becoming popular across healthcare (Kamble,
Gunasekaran, Goswami, & Manda, 2018; Yue, Wang, Jin, Li, & Jiang,
2016), agriculture (Chen, Irawan, & Shae, 2018; Sharma, Kamble, &
Gunasekaran, 2018), finance (Hofmann et al., 2018) and Government
sectors (Ølnes, 2016). BT application operates without the need for
trusted intermediaries ensuring the highest level of cyber-security and
privacy (Kshetri, 2017). BT is expected to make the new era supply
chains more efficient by making the processes more transparent and
reliable, improving the trust related issues in the transactions, which
are inevitable in the complex supply chains due to the involvement of
multiple partners and presence of finance-related redundancies in


S.S. Kamble, et al.


















record keeping (Kim and Laskowski, 2018). Ivanov, Dolgui, and
Sokolov (2019)) claim that compared to a traditional supply chain,
where higher inventories and excess capacity are maintained in an-
ticipation of supply chain disruptions, the BT driven supply chains help
in risk mitigation by efficient management of demand and supply,
available supply chain resources and reducing inventory costs.


2.3. Blockchain adoption in supply chain


While many studies in the literature have focused on highlighting
the benefits and value derived by the organizations through blockchain
implementation, very few studies have analyzed the blockchain adop-
tion behavior at the individual and organizational level. We identified
three studies from the literature that analyses the blockchain adoption
behavior using survey-based methodologies. These studies are based on
the combination of different technology adoption models that included;
technology acceptance model, technology readiness index and theory of
planned behavior (Kamble et al., 2019), and unified theory of accep-
tance and use of technology (Francisco & Swanson, 2018; Queiroz &
Wamba, 2019). The supply chain practitioners are found to be least
concerned about the lack of control or have any distrust on the potential
of blockchain because of highly skilled technical employees and ex-
perience in supply chain domain (Kamble et al., 2019). The behavioral
intention of blockchain adoption is mainly driven by perceived use-
fulness, and therefore sector wise blockchain applications are required
to be developed by the vendors to improve the utility of the blockchain
(Kamble et al., 2019). These studies identify that the blockchain
adoption by logistics and supply chain management practitioners is still
in its nascent stage and there is a need for conducting more sector-
specific blockchain adoption studies postulating the relationships be-
tween the various enablers and barriers of blockchain adoption. The
outcomes of such studies will help the practitioners to understand
better the issues and challenges involved in blockchain adoption and
formulate strategies to overcome them.


2.4. Blockchain in ASCs


The ASC possess numerous efficiency and transparency problems
which cause constant threats to farmers and consumers. Taylor and
Fearne (2009) report that there is a constant disconnect between agri-
cultural production and consumer demand because of numerous in-
termediaries present between producers and consumers. There is also a
lack of transparency due to data discrepancies and inconsistencies, lack
of interoperability, and lack of information on produce traceability
which impacts the ASCs visibility (Wang & Yue, 2017). The agricultural
production is dependent on weather and has to deal with difficult


situations such as crop diseases and pest infestations, the ASCs are
prone to high risk and therefore needs active risk mitigation and control
measures. The other issues faced by the ASCs include higher transaction
settlement time which is a labor-intensive activity (Pingali et al., 2005),
lack of inclusivity of small and medium level farmers which lowers their
economic development and makes them ineffective in catering to the
demand for surplus food supply from an evergrowing population. By
consolidating the links between producers, consumers, farmers, and
markets the ASCs can generate higher incomes (Sanghera, 2018).


The ability of BT in product traceability, authenticity, and per-
forming real-time transactions will bring tremendous improvements in
food traceability which in turn will have a positive impact on food
quality, safety, and sustainability (Li & Wang, 2018; Tian, 2016). BT
can reduce risks and increase the efficiency of the ASCs by eliminating
intermediaries and ensure transparency and traceability in the ASCs
(Yiannas, 2018). The risks and uncertainties can be mitigated by en-
abling trust among market participants. Smart contracts will help in
providing equal opportunities for inclusive market participation for
smallholders. BT can integrate and manage all processes and transac-
tions in ASCs on a real-time basis. For all the transactions processed on
the distributed ledger, transaction details, and product attributes can be
added by the users. Product movements throughout the ASC can be
tracked as the product moves from the farmers to the retailers. Fig. 1
presents a schema of a typical blockchain network in ASC.


2.5. Enablers for BT adoption (BTE)


Table 1 contains the list of BTEs identified from the literature. The
identified factors represent a summarized and synthesized form of the
key BTE’s that drives the organizations to implement blockchain in
their supply chains. The discussion on the identified enablers is pre-
sented below.


2.5.1. Anonymity and privacy (BTE1)
Blockchain has a privacy-preserving framework that allows more


information security (Ouaddah et al., 2017; Maesa, Mori, & Ricci, 2017;
Zyskind & Nathan, 2015). Blockchain deploys a cryptographic private
key which ensures data privacy and anonymity. BT uses ring signatures
for providing anonymity of the users in the network. A ring signature is
encryption that verifies that the signer, i.e., one of the stakeholders
holds a private key that corresponds to a unique set of public keys,
without revealing which one (Nakamoto, 2008). BT ensures data se-
curity without compromising on the privacy of the stakeholders (Yue
et al., 2016).

2.5.2. Auditability (BTE2)
The blockchain is an auditable, trust-free, tamper-proof, and self-


regulating system (Atzori, 2015). Facilitating auditability is one of the
most striking features of BT. The provision of a decentralized database
makes the blockchain fault- free and helps in maintaining an audit trail
(Wijaya, Liu, Suwarsono, & Zhang, 2017). All transactions on the
Blockchain are visible to all its participants, with the conforming in-
crease in auditability and trust (Fanning & Centers, 2016). Deploying
blockchain across the supply chains will improve accountability, by
making the processes trustworthy and guarantee data integrity (Wang
et al., 2019). BT can establish an authoritative record for trade data and
information which allows organizations to automatically reconcile in-
voices, which increases accountability and efficiency (Hofmann et al.,
2018).


2.5.3. Decentralized database (BTE3)
In a blockchain, the metadata used for communication is scattered


throughout the ledger and cannot be collected at one centralized point,
i.e., a blockchain database is distributed. The data is not stored on a
single server but, is distributed simultaneously on different computers
known as nodes. BT uses an open database which enables a decen-
tralized, distributed ecosystem (MacDonald, Allen, & Potts, 2016;
Morabito, 2017; Wright & De Filippi, 2015; Zheng et al., 2016). A de-
centralized database leads to enhanced trust among the participants in
a blockchain.


2.5.4. Immutability (BTE4)
Immutability refers to the phenomena that a thing is unchangeable


over time or is rather unable to be changed. Immutability enables an
audit trail of all the historical operations on the registry to ensure
complete traceability of records (Tran, Xu, Weber, Staples, & Rimba,
2017). The blockchain inherently provides an immutable audit trail
(Weber et al., 2016) and BTs decentralized nature results in reduced
susceptibility to manipulation and forgery of data in the blockchain
network by cyber-attacks (Kshetri, 2017).


2.5.5. Improved risk management (BTE5)
Majority of the risks in business processes arise due to delay in


payments, inefficient asset management practices, and data threats.
With the provision of a distributed database, the final settlement of
trade is possible instantaneously, and the dealing parties no longer must
worry about failure of payments or trade settlement delays (Gokhale,


2016; Wang et al., 2019). The reduced failure risks will further lead to
lower margin or collateral requirements releasing the capital for new
investment opportunities. Hence, with the blockchain deployment,
decisions on investments and collaterals can be taken quickly instead of
following the traditional long-term processes (Micheler & von der
Heyde, 2016; Morini, 2016).


2.5.6. Provenance (BTE6)
BT promises better supply chain provenance (Kim and Laskowski,


2018). Some of the industries derive the value of their goods through
provenance. Deploying BT will create a unique fingerprint for each of
the products. With this, all products can be traced back to their origins
throughout the value chain (Wang et al., 2019; Li and Wang, 2018). For
deploying blockchain in a supply chain, the blockchains are to be ac-
companied by digital tokens. At every stage of the value addition pro-
cess, the stakeholder assigns a digital token to each of the underlying
assets. Whenever the underlying asset moves from one stakeholder to
the other, the digital token corresponding to that asset is also reassigned
in the blockchain. It ensures last mile connectivity as the stakeholders,
at any point in time, can track their assets. Secured data provenance is
crucial for data accountability (Tosh et al., 2017). Food, music, and art
are the major industries where provenance nature of BT can play a
significant role (Rabah, 2017).


2.5.7. Reduced transaction costs (BTE7)
BT usage leads to a reduction in transaction costs (Iansiti & Lakhani,


2017). The BT features such as a decentralized database, cryptographic
signature protection, and reduced need for intermediaries contribute to
the reduction in the transaction costs (Kshetri, 2017). BT also supports
reducing the overhead costs as compared to traditional trading prac-
tices (Sikorski et al., 2017). The smart contract driven trade transac-
tions helps in the development of a multi-supplier base thereby effec-
tively reducing the transaction costs (Hofmann et al., 2018).


2.5.8. Reduced settlement lead times (BTE8)
BT deployment leads to a reduction in settlement lead-time resulting


in a reduction of the transactional lead times. Introduction of BT will
result in consolidation or removal of unnecessary steps involved in
current post-trade settlement process (Gokhale, 2016). The business
processes use the data attributes that are embedded in the transaction
making the transaction flow conditional on time, improving the busi-
ness efficiency by decreasing the transactional lead times (Kamble

S.S. Kamble, et al.






et al., 2019; Shrier, Wu, & Pentland, 2016; Ying, Jia, & Du, 2018.).


2.5.9. Secured database (BTE9)
BT uses a distributed database. This unique feature of BT makes it


highly secure as it uses asymmetrical cryptography and exchange va-
lidation in the form of hash and blocks (referred to as mining). The data
recorded on a block in the ledger is tough to manipulate. The secured
database feature presents a strong case for using it in enabling smart
organizations (Chen et al., 2018; Farell, 2015; Huckle, Bhattacharya,
White, & Beloff, 2016; Ølnes, 2016; Ying et al., 2018.).


2.5.10. Shared database (BTE10)
The information stored in the ledgers is shared between partici-


pants. The participants will have their copy through replication and
have restricted access to relevant transactions from the shared system of
records (IBM, 2017). The distributed nature of the blockchain network
helps to ensure that the transactions do not get compromised from
potentially targeted centralized attacks or accidents (Gokhale, 2016;
Wang et al., 2019).


2.5.11. Smart contracts (BTE11)
To conduct digital supply chain transactions and document ex-


changes, stakeholders must agree on coming to a consensus. A smart
contract, therefore, comes handy as it contains the agreed terms of
stakeholders (Xu et al., 2016). Of late, electronic contracts have made a
drastic impact on the business processes, especially in the context of the
BT (Scott, Loonam, & Kumar, 2017). Blockchains are secured and apply
to a wide range of domains (Bocek & Stiller, 2018). An asset or a cur-
rency is transferred into a BT application digitally in the form of a smart
contract.


2.5.12. Traceability (BTE12)
BT provides the capability to offer traceability with trusted in-


formation, through the process of gathering, sharing, and transferring
the authentic data in sourcing, processing, warehousing, distribution
and sales (Tian, 2016; Jeppsson and Olsson, 2017). Any information
can be traced back to each block of the blockchain via the timestamp
(Sharples & Domingue, 2016). The inherited characteristics of BT such
as the provision of a secure shared and a decentralized database en-
hances trust through transparency and traceability for the transaction
of goods, data, and financial resources (Abeyratne and Monfared;
2016).


2.5.13. Transparency (BTE13)
In BT, the blockchain network generates an identical copy of the


network at each node allowing real-time audit and inspection of the
data which brings transparency in the network. Transparency in all the
network activities and operations brings high visibility to all the sta-
keholders in the network thereby reducing the need of a trusted in-
termediary (Abeyratne & Monfared, 2016). BT can help in bringing
transparency to supply chains (), building trust and reputation (Kshetri,
2017; Steiner, 2015). BT provides new frontiers in redesigning the
network reputation and helps prevent fraudulent activities (Cai & Zhu,
2016). The consensus in the blockchain paves the way for the high level
of authenticity increasing the transparency. Compared to a centralized
supply chain, blockchain is far more efficient and transparent (Kamble
et al., 2019).


2.6. Managerial challenges for BT adoption


Although, the BT is expected to offer many benefits to the tradi-
tional supply chains there are a few challenges the organizations must
address. These challenges pose a significant threat to the implementa-
tion of BT, as implementing such an emerging system from scratch is a
grueling and expensive effort. The experts opine that the organizations
should pursue BT adoption when there is a significant expected benefit


outweighing the risks compared with their existing centralized tech-
nologies. We have categorized these challenges into three categories
namely: organizational, technological and environmental.


2.6.1. Organizational challenges


• Resistance from successful organizations to alter their existing rev-
enue models (Michelman, 2017).
• Resistance from existing supply chain intermediaries and other
partners, as the blockchain aims to remove the intermediaries
(Zhao, Fan, & Yan, 2016).
• Resistance from existing supply chain partners to share valued in-
formation in real-time on a decentralized and shared database.
(Queiroz & Wamba, 2019; Wang et al., 2019).
• The lack of technical competence and awareness of BT (Kamble
et al., 2019). Awareness and expertise are required to be developed
on various aspects of BT that includes; application scope, counter-
parties, process, data, technology, people, regulation, performance,
and security (Angelis & Ribeiro da Silva, 2019).


2.6.2. Technological challenges


• The concern that BT can still be hacked by a group of miners coming
together referred to as selfish mining (Zhao et al., 2016).
• Huge implementation costs, computing power requirements and
environmental concerns because of high energy requirements.
• The blockchain transactions are immutable. However, this will not
allow for any corrections in the database, when errors in data entry
are committed (Kamble et al., 2019).
• Achieving an optimal combination of interoperable and compatible
platforms may be a difficult task (Collomb & Sok, 2016; Wang et al.,
2019).
• Issues such as moving from the existing centralized ledger systems
(ERP) to a decentralized system and data ownership needs a possible
justification in terms of what significant additional benefits the BT
will be able to offer (Angelis & Ribeiro da Silva, 2019).


2.6.3. Environmental challenges


• Bringing all the supply chain and trading partners together to im-
plement blockchain across the supply chain network is a difficult
task (Kshetri, 2018).
• There is a need to comply with the legal and regulatory framework
of Government. Many countries have not yet come with the reg-
ulatory guidelines on the same (Kamble et al., 2019). Since the
contemporary BT architecture can bypass government interference,
revised regulatory and legal restrictions from the government may
restrict the value offered by BT.


3. Research methodology


The present study uses combined ISM and DEMATEL decision-
making techniques. The basis of the selection and details of the in-
tegrated methodology is discussed in this section.


3.1. ISM


Developed by Warfield (1974), ISM is an interactive learning pro-
cess and is considered as a powerful tool for working with participants
in a group where structured debate helps the participants to reach a
consensus. ISM assists in structuring and organization a set of different,
directly and indirectly, associated elements into a comprehensive sys-
tematic model (Sage, 1977). The primary objective of using ISM is to
access the domain knowledge of subject experts in disintegrating a
complex problem into smaller subsystems leading to the construction of
a multi-level structural model (Rana et al., 2018). The emerging


S.S. Kamble, et al.






insights from ISM help in analyzing the inter-relationships and depen-
dence structures between the factors used to illustrate the concept. ISM
has been previously used by the researchers to address different pro-
blems in the information system context (See Table 2).


Though the ISM methodology has been used extensively for mod-
eling the structural variables, it has a few limitations. The main
weakness of ISM is the bias of the person who provides the ratings for
the relationship between the variables. The person's knowledge and
familiarity with the technology and the industry influence the re-
lationship among the variables (Dwivedi et al., 2017). Dwivedi et al.
(2017) list the following steps for deploying the ISM methodology. Si-
milar approaches are used in other research studies (Rana, Barnard,
Baabdullah, Rees, & Roderick, 2019; Hughes, Dwivedi, & Rana, 2017;
Kamble, Gunasekaran, Goswami et al., 2018; Rana et al., 2018; Kamble,
Gunasekaran, Sharma et al., 2018)


i Identification of the variables that influence or has a direct or in-
direct impact on the system. These variables may be identified from
the existing literature or by performing exploratory research stu-
dies. However, the defined variables are required to be validated by
a group of experts.


ii The experts are required to establish contextual relationships be-
tween the variables finalized in the previous step.


iii Development of a structural self-interaction matrix (SSIM) based on
the contextual relationships between the pair of variables. The re-
lationships between a pair of variables are denoted by using the
alphabets V, A, O, and X.


iv The SSIM is then converted to an initial reachability matrix (IRM).
In this step, the alphabets V, A, O, and X are converted to binary
elements 0 and 1.


v The IRM is then checked for the presence of transitivity. The tran-
sitivity rule states that if a variable P affects variable Q and variable
Q affects variable R; then variable P necessarily affects variable Q.
Resolving the transitivity leads to the development of the final
reachability matrix (FRM).


vi The partitioned levels obtained in the FRM is used to draw a di-
rected graph (DG). The transitivity links are eliminated from the
DG, and the contextual links obtained in the IRM are re-established.


vii The variable nodes are then replaced with the statements to convert
the DG into an ISM model.


3.2. ISM-DEMATEL


Binary numbers are used in ISM to represent the contextual re-
lationships between the BTEs (0 for no relationship and 1, if a re-
lationship exists). However, in practice, not all the relationships are
equal and therefore acts as a significant limitation of the ISM metho-
dology. The relationships may be low, moderate, strong, and very
strong (Bhosale & Kant, 2016). In this study, we use DEMATEL meth-
odology to overcome the limitations of ISM and obtain more profound
insights into the inter-relationships of BTEs. The results of the DE-
MATEL are represented through a causal diagram using diagraph,
showing the contextual relationships and the strengths of influence
between the variables (Shieh, Wu, & Huang, 2010). The DEMATEL
methodology has been used in various studies (see Table 3).


Developed by the Science and Human Affairs Program of the
Battelle Memorial Institute of Geneva between 1972–1979, the
DEMATEL methodology analyzes complex and interrelated problems by
resolving the cause and effect relationship among the evaluation cri-
teria and establish inter-relationship among factors (Lin and Tzeng,
2009; Kumar & Dixit, 2018). The output of the DEMATEL method is an
influence relations map (IRM), a graphical representation of inter-
dependencies within the selected elements.


The procedure for DEMATEL methodology is summarized as follows
(Shieh et al., 2010).


3.2.1. Development of direct influence matrix (A)
While developing the A, the diagonal elements of the IRM obtained


in ISM are set to zero while the experts are requested to replace the
relationships (1’s) with 1, 2, or 3 (1= “low influence,” 2 = “medium
influence,” and 3= “high influence.” In the A, x


ij


represents the degree
to which factor i affected the factor j. Independent matrices, one for
each expert (Xk = [x


ij


k]), where k is the expert is developed and a final
average matrix (M= [ aij ]), is computed incorporating the responses of
all the H respondents as follows:


= =H xA 1/ k
H


ij
k


1


3.2.2. Calculate the normalized initial direct- relation matrix
In this step, the average DIM (A) is normalized to develop an initial


direct- relation matrix (D) as follows;
D=A × S;
where S=1/ =max ai n jn ij1 1 .


The values obtained in D range from 0 to 1.


3.2.3. Development of total relation matrix
Next, the total relation matrix (T) is developed by using the ex-


pression T=D (I –D)−1, where I is the identity matrix. The sum of rows
and columns of the total relation matrix is also calculated for computing
the degree of influence.


3.2.4. Calculation of the degree of influence
In the total relation matrix, the sum of any ith row (ri) indicates both

direct and indirect effects given by that factor to the other factors.
Similarly, the sum of columns of any jth column (dj) indicates both di-
rect and indirect effects received by that factor from the other factors.
Therefore, the sum of +r di j indicates the importance of the factor i in
the entire system and the difference r di j indicates the net- effect that
factor i contributes to the system. The factor i is interpreted as a net
cause for positive values of (r di j ) and receiver or result when the
difference (r di j ) is negative.


3.2.5. Digraph plot
In the final step of the DEMATEL, the digraph is plotted using the+r d( i j) and (r di j ) values obtained in the previous step. In order to


filter the significant effects, a threshold values is used.
The framework adopted for research methodology is presented in


Fig. 2.


4. Application of integrated ISM- DEMATEL methodology for
analyzing blockchain enablers in ASC


In this section, we demonstrate the use of ISM and DEMATEL
methodology in the context of identifying the BTE’s in ASC and estab-
lishing the relationships between the identified BTE’s.


4.1. ISM methodology


4.1.1. BT enablers for ASC
The BTE for ASC were identified through an extant literature survey


and validation from a group of experts. The team of experts consisted of
twelve members with the following composition;


i Four academicians: one professor from the supply chain, one pro-
fessor from computer science, one professor from information
technology and one professor from agricultural sciences.


ii Two system integrators with the computer science and engineering
background having expertise in the blockchain area.


iii Four senior-level managers from agri-business organizations.
iv Two managers from the banking industry.


The total number of twelve experts satisfied the group size re-
quirements for conducting exploratory studies as suggested by Robbins
(1994) and Murry and Hammons (1995). Total of fifteen BT enablers
was identified from the literature and discussed with the group of ex-
perts for validation. The validation resulted in the final selection of
thirteen BTE’s for the study. The operational process used to identify
these enablers and their description are earlier discussed in Section 2.


4.1.2. Contextual relationships based on ISM hierarchical levels
For analyzing the BTE’s in Indian ASC, we use a “leads to” type of


contextual relationship structure, which means that one BTE “leads to”
another BTE.


4.1.2.1. SSIM development. The SSIM is developed by establishing the
contextual relationship between the selected pairs of thirteen BTE’s.
The same group experts used to validate the BTE’s were used for
developing the SSIM. As mentioned earlier the following four symbols
(V, A, X, and O) were used to define the contextual relationships:


V→ BTEi will lead to the achievement of BTEj
A→ BTEj will lead to the achievement of BTEi
X→ BTEi and BTEj are correlated and hence help to achieve each


other.
O→ There exists no relationship between BTEi and BTEj and are


independent of each other.
The SSIM presented in Table 4 is interpreted as follows;


1 The enabler “Secure database technology” (BTE9) leads to the
achievement of “Product traceability” (BTE12). Thus, “V” is used to
denote the relationship between BTE1 and BTE4.


2 The enabler “Smart contracts” (BTE11) is achieved with the support
of “Reduced settlement lead time” (BTE8). Thus, “A” is used to
denote the relationship between BTE11 and BTE8.


Fig. 2. Framework for research methodology.


S.S. Kamble, et al.






3 The enablers “Reduced settlement lead time” (BTE8) and “Reduced
costs” (BTE7) helps to enable each other. Thus, “X” is used to denote
the relationship between BTE7 and BTE8.


4 “O” is used when no relationship exists between the selected BTE’s.
In our study, “O” was not used signifying that all the selected BTE’s
either influenced or got influenced by the other BTE’s.


4.1.2.2. IRM development. The IRM is prepared by the conversion of the
V, A, X and O terms in the SSIM into binary elements (0 and 1). The IRM
is shown in Table 5 and is obtained using the following conversion rule:


i If the SSIM entry is “V” for a particular cell (i, j) then in the IRM, the
cell (i, j) is replaced by ‘1’ and the corresponding cell (j, i) is entered
with the value ‘0’.


ii If the SSIM entry is “A” for a particular cell (i, j) then in the IRM, the
cell (i, j) is replaced by ‘0,’ and the corresponding cell (j, i) is entered
with the value ‘1’.


iii If the SSIM entry is “X” for a particular cell (i, j) then in the IRM, the
cell (i, j) is replaced by ‘1’ and the corresponding cell (j, i) is entered
with the value ‘1’.


iv If the SSIM entry is “O” for a particular cell (i, j) then in the IRM,
both the cells (i, j) and (j, i) are replaced by ‘0’.


4.1.2.3. FRM development. This step involved the removal of
transitivity from the IRM in establishing the level partitions. A
MATLAB code was developed and used by the researchers to remove
the transitivity. The obtained FRM is presented in Table 6. The
partitioned levels obtained in the FRM is then used to draw a
directed graph (See Table 7 for the iterations).


4.1.3. ISM-MICMAC analysis
Based on the dependence and the driving power values obtained in


FRM in Table 7, the BTE’s were classified into four quadrants as shown
in Fig. 3. The description of the BTE’s in these four quadrants are dis-
cussed below;


i Autonomous enablers: The BTEs in this quadrant relates to weak
driving and dependence power. The BTEs classified as the autono-
mous enablers are disconnected from the system and do not have
any influence on the adoption of BT in ASC. The findings imply that
all the BTEs identified in our study are relevant and play a sig-
nificant role in enabling the adoption of BTEs in ASC.


ii Dependent enablers: The BTEs in this quadrant relates to weak
driving power and strong dependence powers. The dependent en-
ablers are represented in the top upper half of the ISM hierarchical
model. In the present study, six BTEs viz., auditability (BTE2), im-
mutability (BTE4), improved risk management (BTE5), provenance
(BTE6), traceability (BTE12), and transparency (BTE13) are identi-
fied as the dependent enablers. The findings imply that all these six
BTEs are considered as the topmost the reasons an organization may
consider while deciding to adopt BT in an ASC.


iii Linkage Enablers: The BTEs in this quadrant relates to strong driving
and dependence power and are, therefore considered to be unstable.
In the present study, no BTE was classified in this category in-
dicating a clear demarcation between two broad categories viz.,
dependence enablers and driving enablers.


iv Driving Enablers: The BTEs in this quadrant relates to strong driving
power and weak dependence power. In the present study, these
BTEs are represented in the lower half of the ISM hierarchical
model. The BTEs viz., anonymity and privacy (BTE1), decentralized

database technology (BTE3), reduced transaction cost (BTE7), re-
duced settlement lead time (BTE8), secure database (BTE9), shared
database (BTE10), and smart contracts (BTE11) were identified as
the driving enablers. The finding implies that these BTEs are the
primary enablers that the ASCs sees potential starting points for the
BT adoption in ASC.


The ISM hierarchical model is developed using the inputs from the
FRM and shown in Fig. 4.


4.2. DEMATEL methodology


4.2.1. Average direct influence matrix
In order to obtain better insights on the causal dependencies and its


influence on each other, the DEMATEL methodology was deployed. The
same group of experts used for ISM was approached to get the inputs for
DEMATEL. The relationships between the BTEs were obtained in a di-
rect influence matrix (A) by using integer scores ranging from 0, 1, 2,
and 3 (0 = “no influence,” 1= “low influence,” 2 = “medium influ-
ence,” and 3= “high influence”). The average direct influence matrix is
shown in Table 8.


4.2.2. Normalized initial direct- relation matrix
In this step, the average direct influence matrix is normalized to


develop an initial direct- relation matrix (D), as shown in Table 9.


4.2.3. Total relation matrix
In this step, the total relation matrix (T) was developed by using the


expression T=D (I –D)−1, where I is the identity matrix. We also
calculate the sum of rows and columns of the total relation matrix. (See
Table 10).


4.2.4. Degree of influence
The sum of +r di j indicates the importance of the BTE i in the entire


system and the difference r di j indicates the net- effect that BTE i
contributes to the system. The BTE i is interpreted as a net cause for
positive values of (r di j ) and receiver or result when the difference
(r di j ) is negative. The net effect (prominence) values for the BTE’s
are depicted in Table 11.


4.2.5. Digraph plot
The digraph was plotted using the +r di j and r di j values obtained


in Table 11. In the above digraph, only those effects greater than 0.058
is displayed. The threshold value of 0.58 was computed using the
average of all the elements in the matrix T (Shieh et al., 2010).


5. Discussion on the findings


Based on the findings presented in Table 11 and Fig. 5, the selected
enablers can be prioritized as follows;


BTE12>BTE4>BTE9>BTE3>BTE10>BTE2>BTE6>BTE8>
BTE5>BTE1>BTE7>BTE13>BTE11. The traceability of the agri-
cultural products was found to be the most important enabler
(r+ d=1.101). The net cause enablers were; anonymity and privacy
(BTE1), decentralized database (BTE3), reduced transaction costs
(BTE7), reduced settlement time (BTE8), secured database technology
(BTE9), shared database (BTE10) and smart contracts (BTE1).
Auditability (BTE2), immutability (BTE4), improved risk management
(BTE5), provenance (BTE6), traceability (BTE12) and transparency
(BTE13) were identified as the net receivers based on the (r-c) values. It
is observed in Table 11 that the BTE12 (traceability) does not affect
other enablers but gets affected by all the other enablers. Furthermore,
the BTE4 (immutability) and BTE2 (auditability) affects BTE2 (trace-
ability) and gets affected by all the other enablers. Our findings iden-
tified the blockchain features such as reduced transaction costs, reduced
settlement time, decentralized, secured and shared database as the net
cause enablers, supporting the claims made in the previous studies that
the BTE’s offer supply chain the benefit of disintermediation, enabling
integrity of data (Michelman, 2017), no third-party authentications for
transactions (Yuan & Wang, 2016) resulting in reduction of transaction
costs and settlement lead times (Michelman, 2017). The secured data-
base as a significant enabler supports the claim made in the previous
studies enabling trust between the supply chain partners driving the
interest in blockchain (Collomb & Sok, 2016; Hull et al., 2017;
Nakasumi, 2017). Our findings also support the claim that execution of
smart contracts reduces the number of intermediaries leading to re-
duced costs and transaction delays making the supply chain efficient
(Collomb & Sok, 2016; Bocek & Stiller, 2018). These cause enablers
were found to influence the net receivers providing real-time visibility
of the transactions (transparency) to all the concerned supply chain
partners, significantly improving the information available for risk
management (Engelenburg, Janssen, & Klievink, 2017; Kshetri, 2017).
The information in a blockchain, which is auditable and immutable can
help the supply chain to overcome the problems of unethical and illegal
exploitation due to its transparency (Collomb & Sok, 2016; Nakasumi,
2017; Weber et al., 2016). Traceability was identified to be the key
dependent driver for the blockchain adoption in ASC. The previous
research studies indicated that product visibility and traceability is a
difficult task to be accomplished in the geographically dispersed and
disconnected traditional supply chains. With the consumers paying

more attention to the authenticity and legitimacy of the products they
purchase, there is increasing pressure on the ASC’s to provide them with
the information on the product’s origin. The previous studies have
identified the blockchain to connect the supply chains seamlessly pro-
viding them with a high level of product traceability and visibility
(Bonino & Vergori, 2017; Wang and Yue, 2017; Xu, Chen, Gao, Lu, &


Shi, 2017; Nakasumi, 2017). Our finding revealed that traceability is
the key driving factor for BT adoption in ASC finds strong support in the
literature (Tian, 2016; Foerstl, Schleper, & Henke, 2017; Wang et al.,
2019).

6. Conclusions, implications, contributions, and limitations of the
study


BT is in its nascent stage, and there are numerous challenges-
technical, regulatory, infrastructural, and institutional which BT needs
to overcome before reaching its maturity stage. The other challenges
include enormous computing power and high bandwidth internet
connection, which requires enormous efforts from implementing orga-
nizations to acquire them in a short time (Min, 2019). BT holds tre-
mendous potential in leveraging ASC operations if the enablers to its
adoption are reinforced with favorable strategies and policies. The
enablers of BT in ASC were identified from the literature, validated by
the experts before using the ISM and DEMATEL methodology to es-
tablish the dependency relationships between them. In this section, we
discuss the implications for managers and policymakers and highlight
the limitations of the study.


6.1. Managerial implications


The findings of this study offer meaningful insights to practitioners
in the agribusiness organizations, consultants and blockchain system
integrators while implementing BT in the ASCs. The knowledge of de-
pendent and the driving enablers identified from the ISM will be highly
useful for the practitioners to take care of the implementation chal-
lenges of BT in ASC. In this study, driving enablers define the perfor-
mance outcome of BT. DEMATEL technique uncovered the prominence-
causal relationships amongst the BT enablers, by categorizing the BTEs
in cause and effect groups. This will enable the practitioners to focus on
the causal effects of the enablers in BT adoption and will guide them for
faster implementation of BT in ASCs.The findings suggest that the


practitioners should pay more attention to the identified causes (BTE1,
BTE3, BTE7, BTE8, BTE9, BTE10, and BTE11) rather than the receivers
(BTE2, BTE4, BTE5, BTE6, BTE12, and BTE13). The (r+ c) and (r-c)
value implies that a decentralized database (BTE3) which is sharable
(BTE10) and secured (BTE9) are the critical enablers of the BT in ASC.
These enablers than helps the ASCs in achieving reduced settlement
lead times (BTE8) with reduced transaction costs (BTE7) with the help
of smart contracts (BTE11) that eventually will result in achievement of
a blockchain environment which is auditable (BTE2), immutable
(BTE4), provides provenance (BTE6), improves risk management
(BTE5), transparent (BTE13) and traceable (BTE12). The findings of the
study imply that the ASC pursues substantial benefits from the block-
chain technology and therefore, the practitioners are required to ac-
quire capabilities required to use the technology. The practitioners will
be required to overcome the challenges of taking their stakeholders
along with and includes overcoming the fear of losing revenue models
(Michelman, 2017), banks reluctance to support blockchain enabled
transactions (Zhao et al., 2016), resistance from intermediaries because
of the fear of being removed and supply chain partners aversion from
sharing information (Fawcett, Osterhaus, Magnan, Brau, & McCarter,
2007; Kembro & Näslund, 2014). The findings of the study imply that
the practitioners are highly inclined to have a good traceability system
so that their ASC produces safe and high-quality products, thereby re-
sulting in a good brand image and trust. The food falsification has be-
come a significant issue for all the stakeholders involved in an ASC that
includes the producers, researchers, governments, and consumers. The
existing practices of food labeling systems fall short of providing the
customers the confidence of buying authentic, safe and quality product.
The findings identified the increasing importance of tracking and au-
thenticating the food supply chain to understand provenance and need

for a high level of traceability (Aung & Chang, 2014; Galvez, Mejuto, &
Simal-Gandara, 2018). The findings imply the acceptance of BT as an
innovative tool to ensure an efficient ASC by the practitioners. The
practitioners agree that their ASC can realize traceability with trusted
information sources by collecting authentic real-time data of


agriculture produce, food processing, storage, food distribution and
retailing enabled by a BT platform. The practitioners should aim to
develop strong technical partnerships with leading BT service providers
and system integrators to build traceability capability for the organi-
zations. The findings reveal that to achieve traceability; there is a re-
quirement of a robust technology platform that is secured, sharable,
enabled by smart contracts and decentralized. Such partnerships will be
able to develop a world-class traceability capability. The practitioners
will be required to adopt lean supply chain principles to support in-
formation management during a digital product lifecycle (Vazquez-
Martinez, Gonzalez-Compean, Sosa-Sosa, Morales-Sandoval, & Perez,
2018).


Further to achieve traceability at the global scale, the ASC should
ensure that the BT deployed at their organizational level has mapped all
the critical transactions as per the existing international standards and
are validated. The practitioners should aim at capturing all the relevant
information about the entire cycle of agricultural events onto the
blockchain to enable the transparent and trusted source of information
for the farmers. This will support the farmers and all the other stake-
holders to have data related to the seed quality, soil moisture, climate,
payments, demand and sale price, etc. on one single platform. With BT,
the practitioners will be able to achieve a direct link between the food
producers and the final consumers. The BT initiatives will help to em-
power the small farmers to organize themselves, eliminating the re-
quirement of intermediaries.


Further, the enablers identified in this study provides an opportu-
nity for the stakeholders to quantify, monitor, and control the risks in

the ASCs, relieving the rural distress and social sustainability in de-
veloping countries like India. For this to happen, the practitioners
should include and integrate the technical benefits to be achieved from
BT with a social perspective. The BT enabled ASC should provide op-
portunities to its supply chain partners with appropriate incentives to
capture complete, and reliable data, which is a requirement for
achieving traceability of the farm produce.


6.2. Implications for policymakers


For the policymakers, implementation of BT in ASC will ease the
regulatory and certification norms as the agricultural products can be
traced along with each phase. This will reduce fraudulent activities in
the ASCs and result in accountability of the processes. For ensuring
tamper-proof transactions, appropriate origin labeling, RFID tags, safe
packing, and a secure network of integrated intermediaries needs to be
developed. Traceability details will boost food quality, safety and help
in maintaining quality control throughout the ASC. Transparency in
ASC will ensure that food quality compliance is met and will lead to
improved product sustainability standards. BT will help facilitate in-
ternational trade by meeting the necessary sanitary and phytosanitary
standards (SPS). As produce data about quality, safety, and sustain-
ability would be available on the blockchain network, cases of any food
related contamination and safety issue can be quickly traced. BT will
help in determining the origins of the contaminated product and
thereby ensuring that faulty produced is removed from the warehouse
thereby minimizing health and financial losses. The existing trade fi-
nance methods are complicated, time-consuming, inefficient, and in-
volve much paperwork for managing transactions. This hurts businesses
and hampers the cash-flow and working capital requirements. The
study identified BT to reduce the transaction cost times, settlement lead
times, risks for stakeholders, and efficient transactions processes. BT
will ensure real-time approvals and payments in trade finance.
Transparency in transactions will be maintained as all information
would be available and accessible to all stakeholders across the block-
chain network. Implementing BT will bring in greater auditability and
accountability in the transaction processes.


Financial services such as agriculture value chain credit and in-
surance services also play a crucial role in reducing the stakeholders’
risk. BT can help in financial inclusion of small land holding farmers by
enhancing the efficiency of the ASCs. Smart contract enabled services
on BT can assist the stakeholders in eliminating unnecessary human
interventions which lead to payment delays. Implementing BT will help
in ensuring data integrity and improved visibility of the ASC. BT can
serve as the foundational technology which can integrate, accom-
modate, and cooperate with other emerging technologies into its net-
work thereby improving the ASC continuously. Techniques such as IoT,
artificial intelligence, 3-D printing can help in realizing data-driven
ASCs.


Furthermore, in India, the Government supports the agriculture
sector by providing high levels of subsidy. The budgeted subsidies for
the year 2017-18 was USD 4.9 billion (INR 32,000 Cr) however, there is
no proper mechanisms that exist today on evaluating the transparency
of the disbursement process and to know what proportion of these
subsidies have reached to the targeted beneficiaries. Adoption of BT can
ensure a more transparent system of distribution and delivery of the
subsidies removing the pilferage points in the system. The policymakers
in India should consider all the above enablers of BT and the de-
pendency relationships between them while designing the BT policy for
the Indian agriculture sector.


6.3. Contributions of the study


The primary objective of this paper was to identify the enablers that
encourage the blockchain adoption in ASC and to establish the causal
relationship between them. The study contributes to the theory in


several ways. First, this research has compiled all relevant studies on
blockchain adoption, reviewed and synthesized the literature to extract
enablers of blockchain adoption in ASC context. Second, this is the first
research of its type that has explored the enablers of BT adoption and
derived its framework using a combined ISM and DEMATEL metho-
dology for the ASCs in the context of India. Third, the driving and de-
pendence powers of the BTEs using the MICMAC diagram and the
magnitude of the relationships using the DEMATEL is expected to help
the practitioners and researchers to clearly understand and categorize
the BTEs as independent, mediating or dependent variable. Finally, the
developed framework using ISM and DEMATEL will help the re-
searchers to select the relevant variables and develop new research
models.


6.4. Limitations and future directions


The study identified thirteen enablers for implementing blockchain
technology in agriculture supply chains. The enablers were identified
from existing literature and validated by experts from the field of agro-
based supply chain and technology. The selected experts were from
India, and they might have been missed on a few blockchain technology
enablers, that would have been significant in another countries context.
Therefore, it is recommended to conduct similar studies on enabling
blockchain technology in other countries and explore new enablers that
may have an impact on the blockchain technology adoption. The out-
comes of such studies should be compared with the results obtained in
this study and used for refining the interdependencies between the
enablers. It would be interesting to conduct similar studies in developed
economies as the agricultural practices in these countries are techno-
logically advanced, with few countries already in the stage of im-
plementing blockchain technologies in agriculture supply chains.


Further, the ISM-DEMATEL methodology used subjective judgments
from academicians, practitioners and system integrators to establish the
interdependencies between the selected blockchain enablers. Even
though the researchers took enough care, the personal biases of the
chosen experts may have influenced the outcomes of the study. Future
studies may be conducted on validating the cause-effect relationships
obtained in this study using empirical research designs based on survey
methodology. We recommend the use of Structural Equation Modeling
(SEM) and other multicriteria decision-making tools for this purpose.
