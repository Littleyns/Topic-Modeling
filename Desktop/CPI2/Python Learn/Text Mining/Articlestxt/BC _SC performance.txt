The logistics and supply chain management (SCM) field is experimenting with the integration of blockchain, a 
cutting-edge, and highly disruptive technology. Yet, blockchain is still nascent, and the extant literature on this 
technology is scarce, especially as regards the relationship between blockchain and SCM. Additionally, existing 
studies have not yet addressed sufficiently the enablers of blockchain adoption and the interplay with supply 
chain performance. In order to reduce this gap, this study aims to examine the potential influence of blockchain 
on supply chain performance. We draw on the literature on technology adoption and supply chain performance, 
as well as on the emerging blockchain literature, to develop and test a model in two countries, namely India and 
the US. Accordingly, we administered a survey in order to review the opinions and views of supply chain 
practitioners. The results support the model and indicate that blockchain applications can improve supply chain 
performance. In particular, our findings suggest that knowledge sharing and trading partner pressure play an 
important role in blockchain adoption, and that supply chain performance is significantly influenced by supply 
chain transparency and blockchain transparency. Another finding was the inexistence of evidence for a 
moderation effect of the industry variable on the outcomes. The research conclusions have substantial mana-
gerial and theoretical implications. Our model contributes mainly to the theoretical advancement of SCM- 
blockchain, thus allowing scholars to adapt our validated model.   


1. Introduction 


The logistics and supply chain management (SCM) field recently 
went through unprecedented disruptions (Büyük€ozkan and G€oçer, 
2018), thanks to the development of information and communications 
technologies (ICTs) (Harris et al., 2015; Frank et al., 2019; Chen, 2019; 
Goldsby and Zinn, 2016; Schniederjans et al., 2019). Blockchain is one 
of these disruptive ICTs (Kshetri, 2017a) that could have huge impacts 
on operations, supply chain and business models (Azzi et al., 2019; 
Banerjee, 2018; Chang et al., 2019; Dolgui et al., 2019; Helo and Hao, 
2019; Longo et al., 2019; Schmidt and Wagner, 2019), and facilitate the 
execution of smart contracts between supply chain stakeholders (Dolgui 
et al., 2019). Indeed, blockchain technologies allow the digitalization of 
decentralized business models through the “implementation of autono-
mous algorithmic trust controls for decentralized systems” (Gartner, 
2019). 


Available studies have made it clear that blockchain technologies 


(Helo and Hao, 2019; Helo and Shamsuzzoha, 2020; Kamble et al., 2020; 
Wang et al., 2019; Aste et al., 2017; Y. Chen, 2018; Kshetri, 2018; Vir-
yasitavat et al., 2018) have the potential to transform almost all SCM 
business models, enhance end-to-end supply chain business processes 
and thus improve supply chain performance. Also, blockchain could 
facilitate the access to product or service, thereby influencing customer 
perceived value of the said product or service (Morkunas et al., 2019). 
Considering the blockchain tamper-proof characteristic and the impact 
it may create in the area of logistics and supply chain (Aste et al., 2017; 
Viryasitavat et al., 2018), the level of blockchain adoption in this field is 
expected to increase significantly in order to enhance supply chain 
performance. 


Amongst other advantages, blockchain technologies can improve 
complex supply chain problems (e.g., product safety, supply chain vis-
ibility, transparency, etc.), and enhance the traceability of operations 
(Helo and Shamsuzzoha, 2020; Chang et al., 2019; Saberi et al., 2019; 
Islam et al., 2018; Jeppsson and Olsson, 2017), irrespective of the area

involved: food safety (Tian, 2017) and security (Saberi et al., 2019), 
wine industry (Biswas et al., 2017), healthcare (Benchoufi et al., 2017), 
e-commerce platform (Ying et al., 2018), and so forth. In the supply 
chain contexts, blockchain is recognized as a disruptive technology 
(Choi et al., 2019) that can efficiently solve complex issues such as 
transparency and accountability (Biswas et al., 2017; Francisco and 
Swanson, 2018; Kshetri, 2018; Zou et al., 2018), security (Xu et al., 
2018; Rahmanzadeh et al., 2019), resilience (Xu et al., 2018), the search 
for trust (Kano and Nakajima, 2018; Reyna et al., 2018), uncertainty 
(Kim and Laskowski, 2017), fraud prevention (R. Y. Chen, 2018), con-
fidence (Lu and Xu, 2017), and product recalls (Kshetri, 2017b), and the 
reduction of supply chain costs (Roeck et al., 2019), etc. Thus, inte-
grating blockchain technology with supply chains is a robust and trusted 
approach for supporting and remodeling the supply chain patterns and 
upgrading the level of service delivery. Moreover, blockchain could be 
an appropriate means of achieving supply chain sustainability (Saberi 
et al., 2019). 


While these recent studies have emphasized blockchain benefits in 
the supply chain field, effective applications of this technology are still 
in their infancy (Babich and Hilary, 2020; Queiroz et al., 2019; Schmidt 
and Wagner, 2019), as prior literature does not point blockchain as an 
enabler of supply chain performance and other features (e.g., trading 
partner readiness and pressure, knowledge sharing, diffusion, trans-
parency). For example, a recent review study on bitcoin, blockchain and 
Fintech in the supply chain, (Fosso Wamba et al., 2018), identified very 
few empirical studies on these topics. Therefore, our study aims to 
bridge the knowledge gap identified in the literature by unlocking the 
value that blockchain can add to supply chain performance, and 
exploring cultural differences between countries. That is, this study 
primarily seeks to examine the antecedents of blockchain adoption, and 
its influence not only on supply chain transparency and blockchain 
transparency, but also on supply chain performance. Following previous 
studies on technology adoption which found important differences be-
tween countries (Fosso Wamba et al., 2016; Venkatesh and Zhang, 
2014), we look forward to exploring any potential differences in 
blockchain adoption between countries. Therefore, the following 
research questions need to be addressed:  


1. Is blockchain an effective technology to support supply chain 
performance?  


2. Are there any differences in blockchain adoption behavior in supply 
chains across countries? 


In order to answer these research questions, this study draws on the 
emerging literature on blockchain technologies, on the integration of 
blockchain with supply chain and on technology adoption to develop a 
research model that investigates the relationship between blockchain 
and supply chain performance. The model is tested using data collected 
in India and the US. In terms of contribution, the findings of this study 
should enrich not only the literature on logistics and SCM but also the 
emerging literature on the blockchain. From the managerial perspective, 
our proposed model contributes to enhancing the understanding of re-
lationships between blockchain variables and supply chain perfor-
mance, while imposing consideration for countries’ particularities in 
these relationships. From the theoretical lens, our model was validated 
by the strong results obtained, and this opened up opportunities for an 
in-depth analysis of such relationships. In addition, our model may serve 
as a starting-point for other studies on blockchain in logistics and SCM. 


The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The theoretical foun-
dation for the theory and constructs of interest is explained, which leads 
to the formulation of hypotheses and the research model. The next step 
is the description of the method used to evaluate the model, followed by 
the results and findings. Then, there is a discussion of results, which 
involves managerial and theoretical implications. Research limitations 
and future research avenues are finally presented before the main con-
clusions of this study are drawn. 


2. Theoretical foundation 


Supply chain performance plays a critical role in all types of orga-
nizations, and attaining such performance has been rendered more 
difficult by the increased complexity of operations in the digital age. 
With the integration of blockchain, we deemed it necessary to map the 
gaps and enable a better understanding of the relationship between 
blockchain and supply chain performance, so we revisited the extant 
literature concerning supply chain, blockchain and other technologies in 
order to acquire more insights. 


2.1. Technology adoption models 


In this study, we have adopted an approach that is centered on 
blockchain adoption. This means that we provide the antecedents of 
adoption and all that comes up after adoption, including benefits for the 
supply chain. In the first place, we lay the groundwork about the liter-
ature on technology adoption (Davis et al., 1989; Warshaw and Davis, 
1985). An important contribution was provided by Davis (1989), who 
presented two basic constructs that predict technology adoption and 
usage at the individual level. Is the two constructs are known as key 
elements of the technology acceptance model (TAM). These basic con-
structs are the perceived usefulness (PU) and the perceived ease of use 
(PEOU). Over the last 30 years, various models were proposed based on 
these roots (Venkatesh et al., 2012, 2003; Venkatesh and Davis, 2000; 
Venkatesh and Zhang, 2014). 


Moreover, Venkatesh et al. (2003) extended the main basis of the 
TAM and even included seven more related theories about user 
behavior, in order to obtain a widespread and influential model called 
the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT). This 
model has four basic constructs (performance expectancy, effort ex-
pectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions). But other ele-
ments such as gender, age, experience, and voluntariness of use are 
variables that act as moderators of the model (Venkatesh et al., 2003). 
Since then, other influential studies using or reexamining a modified 
version of the original UTAUT (Dwivedi et al., 2017a) (Dwivedi et al., 
2017b) have been published. Besides, the extension of the UTAUT, 
namely UTAUT2—wich incorporates three constructs (hedonic moti-
vation, price value, and habit) (Venkatesh et al., 2012)—has been 
widely used in and adapted to a good number of contexts (Alalwan et al., 
2017; Farooq et al., 2017; Makanyeza and Mutambayashata, 2018). 


Kamble et al. (2018) recently used the TAM constructs in Indian 
supply chains in order to understand the behavior about blockchain 
adoption. The authors showed that PEOU was a good predictor of the 
PU, which in turn achieved a strong power of predicting the intention to 
use blockchain. Based on the characteristics of the models mentioned 
above (TAM and UTAUT), we proposed a model that captures block-
chain adoption and the impacts of blockchain on supply chain perfor-
mance. Before describing the conceptual model, we have chosen to 
analyze some basic features of blockchain, as well as its interplay with 
supply chain performance. More recently, Wong et al. (2019) proposed 
an adaptation of the well-known Technology, the Organisation and 
Environment (TOE) Framework, to investigate the adoption of block-
chain in operations and supply chain management (OSCM) by Malaysian 
Small-Medium Enterprises. The authors found that complexity, cost, 
relative advantage, and competitive pressure had a significant influence 
on the intention to adopt blockchain. 


2.2. Blockchain applications: fundamentals 


Blockchain technology emerged in the cryptocurrency market 
(Nakamoto, 2008) over a decade ago. The blockchain core is related to a 
distributed database (ledgers) (Babich and Hilary, 2020; Kano and 
Nakajima, 2018; Schmidt and Wagner, 2019) that performs in a shared 
and synchronized environment (chain), in which information is vali-
dated by the users (Aste et al., 2017). We have chosen to follow the

following definition by Risius and Spohrer (2017): 
Blockchain technology refers to a fully distributed system for cryp-


tographically capturing and storing a consistent, immutable, linear 
event log of transactions between networked actors. This is functionally 
similar to a distributed ledger that is consensually kept, updated, and 
validated by the parties involved in all the transactions within a 
network. In such a network, blockchain technology enforces trans-
parency and guarantees eventual, system-wide consensus on the validity 
of an entire history of transactions (Risius and Spohrer, 2017, p. 386). 


This definition implies that, in a decentralized system, once trans-
actions are validated, alterations are no longer possible (Y. Chen, 2018), 
and that there is a generation of the tamper-proof characteristic of 
blockchains. Moreover, all transactions are traceable, thereby giving 
organizations the possibility to achieve the genesis node. In essence, the 
data are organized into blocks that shape a chain (Li et al., 2018) and the 
current block and store the information of the previous. 


Blockchain applications have the potential to remodel and enhance 
the performance of the traceability process through the entire SCM 
(Behnke and Janssen, 2019; Kamble et al., 2019). For instance, in the 
food supply chain (Dabbene et al., 2014; Pizzuti and Mirabelli, 2015; 
Tian, 2017), they indicate the origin of all nodes, and this has triggered 
organizations to invest heavily in systems to improve provenance 
traceability. Recently, Thakur et al. (2019) showed an exciting block-
chain application that is adopted and used for land titling in India. The 
authors highlighted the existence of several challenges regarding the 
implementation of blockchain-like internet infrastructure. Moreover, it 
is well acknowledged that blockchain technologies are able to efficiently 
support node provenance (Biswas et al., 2017; Kim and Laskowski, 
2018), thus facilitating information sharing across the SC environment 
and improving the decision-making process. Furthermore, blockchain 
technologies are expected to bring strong changes to global SCM 
(Hughes et al., 2019), while reconfiguring the role of intermediaries in 
supply chains (T€onnissen and Teuteberg, 2019). As emerging economies 
are increasing adopting such technologies, they can support and render 
more efficient the exploration of global supply chains (Schuetz and 
Venkatesh, 2019) while enhancing financial inclusion. 


2.3. Supply chain performance as a result of blockchain integration: an 
overview 


Our study follows previous studies that considered the supply chain 
as a complex network composed of nodes and links (Borgatti and LI, 
2009; Carter et al., 2015; Choi and Dooley, 2009). In this context, supply 
chain networks can be viewed as a complex adaptive system (Choi et al., 
2001) that needs information resulting from processed data in order to 
support organizations’ decision-making processes for improved perfor-
mance. A recent study by Pan et al. (2019) found that organizations 
could implement blockchain to achieve improved performance on sales 
costs and, ultimately, create an impact on supply chain performance. 
Therefore, the recent literature fully agree on the potential of the 
blockchain technologies to transform the operations and supply chains 
(Azzi et al., 2019; Banerjee, 2018; Helo and Hao, 2019; Helo and 
Shamsuzzoha, 2020). Several benefits of blockchain, when applied in 
operations and supply chain, can be achieved. For instance, blockchain 
technologies lead to real-time traceability (Helo and Shamsuzzoha, 
2020), improved transparency between supply chain members (Bane-
rjee, 2018), reduced risks of counterfeiting and more efficiency in supply 
chain processes (Azzi et al., 2019). In addition, blockchain can improve 
and bring innovations to all manufacturing supply chains (Abeyratne 
and Monfared, 2016). This means that with blockchain technologies, 
supply chain operations in any sector can be improved, together with 
several other benefits like the minimization of cost transactions, more 
product visibility due to empowered traceability, and accountability to 
the supply chain members, etc. As a result, supply chain performance is 
positively impacted. 


In this study, supply chain performance is defined as “the efficient 


and effective execution of supply chain tasks” (Autry et al., 2014: 57). 
The literature on business logistics and supply chain management shows 
that considerable efforts have been put into deeper the understanding of 
supply chain performance behavior (Datta, 2017; Gligor, 2014; Grawe 
et al., 2011; Hollos et al., 2012; Singh, 2015; Xu and Dong, 2004; Zhu 
et al., 2018). A good number of scholars have found significant re-
lationships between supply chain performance and other key variables, 
and have noted that these relationships affect the SCM. Such relation-
ships are the relationship that is recognized to exist between knowledge 
exchange and logistics innovation, and the one between logistics inno-
vation and performance (Grawe et al., 2015), with consideration for the 
boundary between service providers and customers. 


Recently, White (2017) employed a Delphi study in order to under-
stand the impact of different types of blockchain in business. The author 
found that blockchain could improve performance in transactions be-
tween partners. In a study of blockchain in the agriculture supply chain, 
Kamble et al. (2019) found several enablers that can be brought about by 
blockchain for increased performance: transparency, traceability, lead 
times reduction, among others. According to Wang et al. (2018), the 
benefits of blockchain in supply chains span expanded visibility, 
improved data security, and disintermediation, etc. All these benefits 
can impact performance. Besides, Wang et al. (2019) emphasized the 
potential of blockchain technologies to support operational improve-
ment in supply chains, thus impacting on performance. 


Additionally, SCM performance was investigated while considering 
various risk dimensions (Wagner and Bode, 2008), and findings showed 
that supply chain performance can be affected negatively by supply 
chain risks. Thanks to blockchain, supply chain risks can be mitigated 
(Kshetri, 2018; Tian, 2017), together with uncertainties and other ir-
regularities. Blockchain’s features that can mostly come into play here 
are the tamperproof nature of any transaction with blockchain and the 
ability to create and foster transparency, accountability, traceability and 
decentralization. 


Also, in line with their ability to help understand the supply chain 
management complexities, blockchain applications are well fitted to 
eliminate uncertainty (Kim and Laskowski, 2017), and this is all the 
more important as a high level of uncertainty in the SCM can negatively 
affect not only a focal organization but the entire network. Considering 
the complexity of such an environment, SCM performance can be 
negatively affected (Wagner and Bode, 2008). 


Furthermore, blockchain applications play a key role in reducing 
costs in complex supply chain networks (Kshetri, 2018), but also in 
ushering in more transparency in the processes, adequate data sharing 
and information between organizations (Lu and Xu, 2017), cooperation 
(Aste et al., 2017), as well as trust and efficiency (Kshetri, 2018), among 
others. 


Schmidt and Wagner (2019) recognized the potential of blockchain 
to minimize transaction costs across the supply chains, reduce oppor-
tunistic behavior and increase transparency in the transactions. How-
ever, there are some complex challenges to overcome; they are related to 
privacy, data quality, network effect, and uncertainty. Also, the authors 
made six robust propositions concerning blockchain, which is as an 
adequate tool for addressing the above-mentioned issues while 
enhancing governance through market orientation. In this context, 
recently, Babich and Hilary (2020) found five key strengths and weak-
nesses in the interplay between blockchain and operations management. 
The authors reported strengths such as visibility, aggregation, valida-
tion, automation, and resiliency. Weaknesses included the lack of pri-
vacy, the lack of standardization, garbage (in/out), the effect of the 
black box, and inefficiency. Nevertheless, Here, inefficiency resides in 
the amount of energy that is needed to perform the transactions (in the 
case of bitcoin). Moreover, is the authors found no evidence of 
blockchain-enabled network performance as compared to the central-
ized database. 


In the next section, we derive the various hypotheses for this study 
and further present a conceptual model that will enable us to unlock and

gain a better understanding of the relationship between blockchain and 
supply chain performance. In Appendix A, we follow some of the best 
practices (Mentzer and Kahn, 1995; Podsakoff et al., 2016) regarding the 
definitions of constructs. Thus, we followed four steps, namely: (i) 
searching for the potential definitions; (ii) organizing the said defini-
tions; (iii) formulating the preliminary definition; and (iv) refining the 
concept. 


3. Development of hypotheses and research model 


3.1. Knowledge sharing 


The organizations’ necessity for innovation has been working as an 
essential driver for improving knowledge sharing (Lin, 2017). In the 
blockchain-integrated context, knowledge sharing (KS) primarily refers 
to the exchange of knowledge between firms through their supply chain 
members. With blockchain, the players of the same supply chain can 
share real-time information (Tian, 2017), including skills about their 
common systems and best practices, and how to potentialize the utili-
zation in various SCM processes. KS is concerned with individuals’ be-
haviors when they share information within organizations (Abubakar 
et al., 2017; Ramayah et al., 2014; Yi, 2009). Therefore, the knowledge 
involved in KS may be technologies and skills between organizations 
(Farooq, 2018). From this perspective, we argue that KS between firm 
partners within the same supply chain is fundamental to blockchain 
adoption. Therefore, we hypothesize that: 


H1. Knowledge sharing has a positive significant effect on blockchain 
adoption 


3.2. Trading partner pressure 


A trading partner relationship refers to a business relationship that 
can involve two or more organizations or organizations and customers. 
The most common configuration of the trading partner relationship is on 
the organization-suppliers side. However, the trading partners- 
customers relationship is also essential (Angeles and Nath, 2000). 
Considering the supply chain context, these relationships tend to be 
more complicated, mainly by the number of nodes in the networks. In 
addition, trading partner readiness can support the optimization of the 
organization’s resource capabilities (Lin, 2006), including as regards 
saving costs (Holmes and Srivastava, 1999). Furthermore, while trading 
partner readiness can impact blockchain adoption, pressures can origi-
nate from trading partners and others stakeholders (Wang et al., 2010), 
all of which have the potential of leading to a new technology adoption 
direction (Hu and Hsu, 2010; Lamming et al., 2001; Tachizawa and 


Wong, 2014). Previous studies suggest that trading partner pressure is 
an influential construct for technology adoption (Low et al., 2011; Wang 
et al., 2010). Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis: 


H2. Pressures from trading partners have a positive significant effect 
on blockchain adoption. 


3.3. The role of blockchain adoption and transparency 


Blockchain remains a significant technology that organizations have 
to develop, implement, and manage. It can help integrate different 
business partners in the SCM, contributing to a more reliable environ-
ment (Viryasitavat et al., 2018). With the blockchain technology, or-
ganizations can achieve meaningful performance improvement in the 
supply chain network (Kshetri, 2018), bringing in more transparency 
(Venkatesh et al., 2016), though it is a complicated subject in several 
areas and particularly in SCM (Lamming et al., 2001; Morgan et al., 
2018; Vorabutra, 2016). In these circumstances, blockchain can increase 
the level of transparency within the supply chain network (Thakur et al., 
2019; Biswas et al., 2017; Francisco and Swanson, 2018; Jeppsson and 
Olsson, 2017; Lu and Xu, 2017), thereby supporting trust improvement. 
Thus we hypothesize that: 


H3a. Blockchain adoption has a positive significant effect on supply 
chain transparency. 


H3b. Blockchain adoption has a positive significant effect on block-
chain transparency. 


3.4. The role of blockchain and supply chain performance 


The members of a supply chain network exchange a significant 
amount of data every day. Supply chain performance (Qrunfleh and 
Tarafdar, 2014) is generally achieved or enhanced with increased 
complexity, mainly because of the number of available technologies and 
the issue of information asymmetry. In such circumstances, blockchain 
technologies are welcome not only to takcle such cases of complexity, 
but also to promote and improve performance in the OSCM (Hyper-
ledger, 2019; Maersk, 2018) while contributing significantly to new 
business and revenue streams (Delloite, 2019) (See Appendix B for more 
details). And given the important number of benefits attributed to 
blockchain adoption, including accountability improvement (Aste et al., 
2017; Biswas et al., 2017; Kshetri, 2018; Zou et al., 2018), this tech-
nology is also expected to play a critical role in tackling OSCM chal-
lenges such as the need for transparency and trust between members. In 
terms of traceability SCM gains more accountability and transparency, 
with a positive effect on all its members. If blockchain can eliminate

information variability in SCM (Aste et al., 2017), it is evident that trust 
and cooperation will improve on supply chain performance. This leads 
us to hypothesize that:

4. Research methodology 


4.1. Sampling design and data collection 


This study is part of a large project aiming to investigate the adop-
tion, use and impact of blockchain at the firm and supply chain levels 
(Queiroz and Fosso Wamba, 2019). The data collection was realized 
through a survey approach. The survey approach is suitable when it 
comes to investigating a phenomenon that is of interest (in our case, 
blockchain adoption and its relationship with supply chain perfor-
mance). Indeed, our sample frame and data collection (Fawcett et al., 
2014; Guide Jr. and Ketokivi, 2015; Helmuth et al., 2015) enabled us to 
better unveil and analyze the characteristics of the phenomenon under 
study here. Like most recent studies that used a survey method approach 
to collect data (Dai et al., 2015; Ebad, 2018; Gligor, 2014; Schoenherr 
et al., 2014), this study added other items from the extant literature and 
adapted them to fit our research context (Dai et al., 2015). 


All constructs were measured by a 7-point Likert scale (ranging from 
“strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”). The survey was administered by 
a leading market research firm (http://www.researchnow.com/en-US. 
aspx), who collected data in India and the US, from supply chain pro-
fessionals operating in different industries. These participants had at 
least three years of experience with blockchain-related projects in the 
SCM field (e.g., interaction with suppliers projects, organization studies 


to adopt). That is, due diligence was performed to ensure that all par-
ticipants had some experience with blockchain. All aspects (operational, 
R&D, plan etc) were concerned with blockchain experience. It is 
important to note that we applied a survey examining the opinions and 
views of supply chain practitioners about the adoption of blockchain and 
its interplay with the supply chain performance. Appendix B highlights 
some examples of blockchain experience as it can appear in companies. 
In other words, our informants’ sample met the criterion of rigorousness 
(Fawcett et al., 2014). Specifically, the sample was made up of 344 valid 
responses from out of the 974 India-based professionals who agreed to 
participate in the survey, which gave a response rate of 35.32%. In the 
US, 6131 professionals took part in the survey, 394 of whom sent valid 
responses. Here, we obtained a response rate of 6.43%. Table 1 shows 
the statistics of constructs, while Table 2 reports the respondents’ 
characteristics. 


In terms of gender, the distribution of sample characteristics was 
similar in the two surveyed countries (India and the US). However, fe-
male accounted for approximately 30% of respondents from both 
countries. The majority of respondents belonged to the age bracket 
26–33 (51.2%) in India, against the age bracket 34–41 (39.6%) in the 
US. Considering the education, the majority of the respondents were 
holders of a postgraduate degree, that is, 52.6% in India and 33% in the

US. Moreover, the respondents’ dominant industry in India was 
manufacturing (35.2%), whereas, in the US, we had transportation 
(16.2%), manufacturing (14.7%) and construction with (14.5%). 


5. Data analysis 


We used a classical structural equation modeling (SEM) (Bollen, 
1989) to test the proposed model. All the analyses were performed in R 
3.5.1 using the lavaan R package, version 0.6–3 (Rosseel, 2012; Rosseel 
et al., 2019) and the semTools R package, version 0.5–1 (Jorgensen et al., 
2019). The Maximum Likelihood estimator for SEM requires the data to 
be multivariate normality. We used the Mardia’s multivariate test of 
normality (Mardia, 1970) to assess the skewness of the data at the 
pooled and country levels. The Mardia’s estimate of multivariate skew 
equals 173.94 (p-value < 0.001) at pooled level, 278.43 (p-value <
0.001) for the Indian sample and 270.72 for the US sample (p-value <
0.001). The null hypothesis of multivariate normality is rejected both at 
pooled and country level. As a consequence, we used the robust 
maximum likelihood (MLM) estimator and the Satorra-Bentler corrected 
standard errors method (Satorra and Bentler, 1994) to estimate model 
parameters and their standard errors in the lavaan package (Rosseel 
et al., 2019). MLM adjusts the chi-square (resulting in the 
Satorra-Bentler corrected chi-square) for its upward bias in the case of 
nonnormally distributed data (Maydeu-Olivares, 2017). 


The fit of the model was evaluated using the Satorra-Bentler chi- 
square statistic (SBχ2), the robust comparative fit index (CFI), the robust 
root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and the robust 
standardized root-mean-square residual (SRMR). Following Hu and 
Bentler (1999), Steiger (2007), Hooper et al. (2008), and van de Schoot 
et al. (2012), a model fits the data when CFI > 0.95, RMSEA < 0.06 and 
SRMR > 0.05. We also reported the p-value associated with the null 
hypothesis of a population RMSEA <0.05 and the 90% confidence in-
terval for the Robust RMSEA value. 


Cronbach’s alpha, and associated confidence interval (Trinchera 
et al., 2018), was used to measure the internal consistency of each latent 
variable in the model. Omega Coefficient (Raykov, 2001) and the 
Average Variance Extracted (AVE) were used to assess the reliability of 
each construct, while the HTMT approach (Henseler et al., 2015) was 
used to assess the discriminant validity. In particular, discriminant 
validity is considered to apply if all the values in the HTMT matrix are 
smaller than 0.90 (Gold et al., 2001; Teo et al., 2008). 


5.1. Common method bias 


Common method bias (CMB) (Podsakoff and Organ, 1986) may 
inflate relations in the model. We tested structural model results for CMB 
using the post-hoc marker variable approach, as presented by Lindell 
and Whitney (2001). Following Malhotra et al. (2006), the correlations 
among the observed variables are adjusted considering the smallest 
correlation among the observed variables as a proxy for CMB. In Table 3 
we compared the structural model parameter estimates obtained after 
correcting for CMB (i.e. CMB-adjusted estimates) to the original struc-
tural model parameter estimates. Path coefficient values and associated 
significances remained stables after correcting for CMB. We concluded 
that our model was not affected by CMB. 


5.2. Validation of the measurement model 


Cronbach’s alpha and construct reliability were higher than 0.86 for 
all the constructs in the model (see Table 4). Moreover, the lower bounds 
of the confidence intervals computed for the Cronbach’s alpha were 
largely higher than the 0.70 threshold commonly used to verify the 
reliability of a scale (Nunnally, 1978). The scales used to measure our 
constructs were all highly reliable. 


Our model perfectly fitted the data at pooled level (n ¼ 738). All the 
fit indexes showed an excellent fit (SBχ2 ¼ 560.70 with 369 df; Robust 


CFI ¼ 0.98; SRMR ¼ 0.03; Robust RMSEA ¼ 0.03; RMSEA < 0.05; and 
95% CI [0.02; 0.03]). 


Factor loadings are reported in Appendix C. All the loadings were 
higher than the 0.80 cut-offs (Fornell and Larcker, 1981) and the AVE 
values in Table 4 were higher than 0.60, indicating an excellent 
convergent validity (Fornell and Larcker, 1981; Hajli et al., 2017) for all 
the constructs in the model. The correlation between the latent variables 
(in Table 5) and the results of the HTMT approach (in Table 6) supported 
discriminant validity: HTMT values were all smaller than the 0.90 
threshold (Gold et al., 2001; Teo et al., 2008). 


5.3. Validation of the structural model 


Strutural model results obtained on the pooled data are reported in 
Table 7. According to these results, all the research hypotheses are 
verified at a significance level <0.01. In particular, our results support 
the hypothesis of a direct, positive impact of KNSH (β ¼ 0.576, p-value <
0.001) and TPPS (β ¼ 0.342, p-value < 0.001) on BADOP. Hypotheses 
H3a and H3b are also verified: BADOP significanlty and positively im-
pacts on both SCTRAN (β ¼ 0.798, p-value < 0.001) and BTRAN (β ¼
0.832, p-value < 0.001). To conclude, our data support the positive and 
direct effect of BADOP (β ¼ 0.253, p-value ¼ 0.006), SCTRAN (β ¼ 0.343, 
p-value < 0.001) and of BTRAN (β ¼ 0.385, p-value < 0.001) on SCPERF. 


5.4. Multigroup comparison: measurement model invariance 


Cross-culture measurement invariance of the constructs in our model 
has been tested by comparing the fit of nested models including an 
increasing level of invariance. We used the Robust Chi-Square Differ-
ence Test (Satorra and Bentler, 1994), and the difference in Robust 
Comparative Fit Indexes (ΔCFIs) (Chen, 2007; Cheung and Rensvold, 
2002) for comparting the fit of nested models. We consider two models 
to fit the same if ΔCFI <0.01 (Chen, 2007) and the p-value associated

with the Robust Chi-Square Difference Test is < 0.05. Between two 
equivalent models, the less complex (i.e. one (with a higher degree of 
freedom)) is preferred. 


In the first step, we tested our data for the configural invariance 
between the Indian and the US respondents. The configural invariance 
model (Model 1: configural invariance in Table 8) assumes the same 
structure in the loading matrix (i.e. items are associated with the same 
latent constructs in the two sub-samples), but different values for the 
loadings in the two sub-samples. After verification of configural 
invariance, we tested for metric invariance. The metric invariance 


model (Model 2: weak invariance in Table 8) constrains the loadings to 
be the same between the two sub-samples. Successively, we tested for 
the scalar invariance (Model 3: strong invariance in Table 8) by con-
straining both the loadings and the intercepts to be the same between 
the two sub-samples. To conclude, we tested for strict and scalar in-
variances. The strict invariance model (Model 4: strict invariance in 
Table 8) imposes the loadings, the intercepts and the residual variances 
to be equal between the two sub-populations. The strong, scalar 
invariance model (Model 5: scalar invariance in Table 8) constrains the 
loadings, the intercepts, the residuals variances and the latent variable 
means to be equal. 


The series of model comparisons in Table 8 indicates that strict 
invariance is verified for the measurement model across the Indian and 
the US samples. Strong scalar invariance is rejected when considering 
the p-value associated to the Robust Chi-Square Difference Tests, while it 
is verified when referring to the ΔCFI. According to these results, we 
assume the factor loadings, the intercepts, and the residual variances to 
be equal between Indian and US samples. 


5.5. Multigroup comparison: structural model invariance 


Results in Table 8 supports measurement invariance between the 
Indian and the US samples. We can now compare the two sub-samples in 
terms of structural model parameters. To test for structural invariance, 
we fit a series of the model each constraining a structural path separately 
(Chin et al., 2016). We then compare the fit of these models to a baseline 
model that assumes measurement invariance and unconstrained path 
coefficients between the two sub-samples. As for the measurement 
invariance, we consider a constrained model to equally fits the data 
compared to the baseline model if the ΔCFI <0.01 (Chen, 2007) and the 
p-value associated to the Robust Chi-Square Difference Test is < 0.05. If 
the constrained and the baseline models fit the same, we conclude that 
there is no significant difference in the constrained path coefficient be-
tween the two sub-samples. We report, in Table 9, the path coefficients 
at a country level along with their significance level and the Robust 
Chi-Square Difference Tests results when comparing the baseline model 
to the model imposing the corresponding path to be equal between the 
sub-sample. 


Results show no significant differences when comparing Indian and 
US respondents path coefficients, though the relation between BADOP 
and SCPERF is not significant at p < 0.05 for the US sample. Multigroup 
comparison support the idea that the measurement model is the same for 
both the Indian and US respondents and that there is no difference in the 
structural model. 


5.6. Moderation effect of the respondents’ background industry 


To investigate the moderation effect of the background industry of 
the respondents on the relations that are created in the model, we per-
formed a multigroup analysis by comparing the respondents from

manufacturing industry to respondents from all the other industries. We 
followed the same procedure as described in sub-sections 5.4 and 5.5, 
and then we used the same thresholds to judge the equivalence of the 
measurement and structural models between the manufacturing and 
non-manufacturing industries. 


By comparing the fit of the different nested models in Table 10, we 
verified the measurement model invariance at the configural, metric and 
scalar levels (no significant difference with respect to the Robust Chi- 
Square Difference, and ΔCFI < 0.01 for the three nested comparisons). 
We can therefore conclude on the stability of the measurement model 
between respondents from a manufacturing industry versus respondents 
from a non-manufacturing industry: the intercepts and the loadings are 
the same across the two groups. 


Following the verification of the measurement invariance among 
respondents from different industries, we tested for the moderation ef-
fect of the background industries of the respondents on each relation in 
the structural model. We thus compared the fit of a series of models, with 
each constraining a structural path separately to a baseline model that 
assumes measurement invariance and unconstrained path coefficients 
among industries. Results in Table 11 show no significant differences 
when comparing respondents from a manufacturing industry to those in 
a non-manufacturing industry. According to our results, there is no ev-
idence for an effect of the industry background of the respondents on the 
results. 


6. Discussion and implications 


The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between 
blockchain and supply chain performance. This study contributes to 
enriching the extant literature on logistics, supply chain management, 
and blockchain technologies, as it helps to unlock and enhance our 
understanding of supply chain performance and the impact of block-
chain. Our findings offer significant insights from the managerial and 
theoretical perspectives, providing valuable input to help tackle 


contemporary challenges in the area of logistics and supply chain 
management (Goldsby and Zinn, 2016; Zinn and Goldsby, 2017a, 
2017b), as well as emerging opportunities in the digital age. 


In line with the previous literature on technology adoption, the re-
sults obtained from the verification of our hypotheses showed that these 
were confirmed, then bringing essential insights and validating new 
constructs for the integration of blockchain into the supply chain envi-
ronment. For instance, the constructs Knowledge sharing (H1) and 
Trading Partner Pressure (H2) are being found to impact blockchain 
adoption in both countries, India and the US. The validation of these two 
constructs applied to the integration of blockchain with supply chain is 
fundamental: while these two constructs have been already investigated, 
they were not concerned with the issue of blockchain. For instance, Lin 
(2017) found a significant positive effect of knowledge sharing diffusion 
in electronic supply chain management, but there was not any rela-
tionship with blockchain. Moreover, our results about trading partner 
pressure were in line with previous literature on technology adoption 
(Low et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2010), but without anything related to 
blockchain. 


Our proposed hypotheses H3a and H3b were dealing with the effect 
of blockchain adoption on supply chain transparency and blockchain 
transparency, respectively. Not surprisingly, the results confirmed pre-
vious studies: the power of blockchain to enable more transparency in 
supply chains (Thakur et al., 2019; Kshetri, 2018; Lu and Xu, 2017) is 
real and verifiable. By contrast, previous studies on blockchain adoption 
(Kamble et al., 2018; Francisco and Swanson, 2018) could not demon-
strate the impact of blockchain adoption, supply chain transparency and 
blockchain transparency on supply chain performance as postulated in 
hypotheses H4, H5 and H6, respectively. Our findings validated these 
relationships and actually contributed to enriching the blockchain 
literature (Thakur et al., 2019; Aste et al., 2017; Kshetri, 2018; Zou et al., 
2018). 


It is worthwhile indicating that our results reinforce previous liter-
ature conclusions on the challenges and the benefits of blockchain in

supply chains (Schmidt and Wagner, 2019). It means that our findings 
are in line with the main findings of other authors, one of them being 
that blockchain could enable more transparency in transactions and 
contribute to minimizing transaction costs. Moreover, our findings on 
supply chain transparency, blockchain transparency and supply chain 
performance suggest that the various weaknesses reported by Babich 
and Hilary (2020), including the lack of privacy and standardization, 
and inefficiency, could have different perceptions in supply chains. 
Therefore, it is important to note that all hypotheses were supported in 
both the Indian and American contexts (see Table 9), that is, our results 
suggest that there are no significant differences between the path co-
efficients of Indian and US respondents. If we consider that fact that 
single countries have so far been the focus of researchers (Wong et al., 
2019; Kamble et al., 2018), it clearly appears that our findings should 
have important implications. These are discussed in the next section. 


6.1. Managerial implications 


By shedding more light on the relationship between blockchain and 
supply chain performance, this study should certainly help managers to 
better grasp this important aspect of an issue that needs their informed 
decision. More specifically, the results of the study show strong evidence 
about decision-makers’ behavior in relation to the relationship between 
blockchain and supply chain performance in two countries (India and 
the US). The extant logistics and supply chain literature (Autry et al., 
2014; Grawe et al., 2011) has highlighted the importance of supply 
chain performance in all contemporary businesses, as well as the need 
for managing effectively the supply chain integration (Turkulainen 
et al., 2017). In this outlook, our research opens up an avenue by 
developing and testing a model that establishes strong relationships 
between blockchain and supply chain performance. 


The findings unveil essential challenges facing managers. In the first 
place, managers have to gain an in-depth understanding of the block-
chain adoption complexities. As indicated by the results of this study, 
knowledge sharing (KNSH) and trading partner pressure (TPPS) exert 
substantial influence on blockchain adoption in both countries, India 
and the US. However, managers are challenged to detect countries’ 
particularities in some cases. Managers of firms operating in a global 
market must, therefore, adjust their marketing policies and decisions 
bearing in mind the existence of differences in blockchain adoption 
behavior across the countries. In line with prior studies reporting 
knowledge development in supply chains (Grawe et al., 2015, 2011; 
Schoenherr et al., 2014; Waller and Fawcett, 2014), our results confirm 
that knowledge is a critical resource in blockchain and supply chain 
integration for increased performance. 


To effectively support the development of blockchain in the supply 
chain field, managers should put in the effort to better grasp the rela-
tionship between blockchain adoption and supply chain performance. 
Our results showed that supply chain transparency and blockchain 
transparency nurture a strong direct relationship. In practice, managers 
should be aware that blockchain is a strong predictor of supply chain 


performance. Therefore, they are expected to improve their under-
standing of blockchain transparency and supply chain transparency. For 
example, the extant literature on blockchain reports that many im-
provements are being noticed for aspects such as transparency, visibility 
and accountability in supply chains owing to blockchain applications 
(Aste et al., 2017; Biswas et al., 2017; Kshetri, 2018). If firms’ managers 
upgrade their understanding of the relationship between blockchain and 
supply chain performance, they will potentially play a more funda-
mental role in supporting their various organizations’ operations. 


6.2. Theoretical implications, limitations and future research 


From a theoretical perspective, this study firstly contributes to 
shedding more light on the disruptions, complexities and dynamics in 
logistics and supply chains imposed by the emerging technologies. 
Secondly, this study kick-starts a research stream about blockchain and 
supply chain performance, with a robust theoretical model. The results 
validated the model in two countries, India and the US. Our results 
answered the two research questions, showing that blockchain is an 
effective technology to support supply chain performance. Regarding 
the second question, our results found no significant differences between 
countries, concerning blockchain adoption and supply chain perfor-
mance in an integrated conceptual model; however, more empirical 
research is required to confirm this behavior. 


Thirdly, the study’s results revealed that blockchain adoption has a 
high positive influence on supply chain performance and that the supply 
chain performance is significantly influenced by supply chain trans-
parency and blockchain transparency. From a theoretical lens, this re-
inforces the idea that supply chain performance can be predicted by a set 
of constructs. Lastly, the findings show that, despite the embryonic 
development of blockchain, its influence on supply chain operations 
cannot be neglected, and should, on the contrary, be more empirically 
investigated with a view to a better understanding. 


As for the main limitations of this study, we believe that adding 
variables (Golicic et al., 2012) to predict the direct and mediated effects 
of blockchain adoption and supply chain transparency/blockchain 
transparency on supply chain performance, can enrich the model. Such 
variables include accountability (Zou et al., 2018), confidence in the 
process, and the effect of data sharing (Lu and Xu, 2017), all of this in a 
blockchain context. Integrating these variables in order to adapt and 
expand our model may be an interesting topic for future studies. So goes 
with the examination of the negative outcomes (Gligor, 2014) of the 
relationship between blockchain and supply chain performance, 
although our research rather concluded with positive results in this re-
gard. On the other hand, since the literature related to technology 
adoption (Dwivedi et al., 2017b, 2017a; Behnke and Janssen, 2019; 
Kamble et al., 2019) has not yet proposed a model similar to the one 
developed in this study, it may useful to compare our findings with 
others. However, this limitation does not affect the contribution of this 
work. 


As a reminder, the respondents from the manufacturing industry are

being compared with their counterparts from all the other industries. 
According to our results, there is no evidence attesting a moderation 
effect of the (binary) industry variable on the results. However, it should 
be noted that our sample composition could not enable us to compare 
respondents from several types of industry from an intersectoral 
perspective. This analysis could have been an interesting approach for 
future studies to deeply investigate the link between blockchain and 
supply chain performance. 


Moreover, while our model and results represent a strong contribu-
tion to the advancement of the literature on the integration of block-
chain with supply chains, there is an urgent need to carry out more 
research in this area. Our model considers two constructs to predict 
blockchain adoption (knowledge sharing, and trading partner pressure), 
and further research may usher in other enriching developments. For 
instance, reciprocal connectivity (Autry et al., 2014), logistics innova-
tion (Grawe et al., 2015) and other knowledge predictors (Schoenherr 
et al., 2014) may come in, but also operational flexibility (Gligor, 2014). 
Moreover, key aspects such as blockchain transparency (Jeppsson and 
Olsson, 2017), the impact of the blockchain on supply chain security 
(Kshetri, 2017b) and on performance need further investigation. 


Another limitation of this study lies in the fact that the impact of the 
smart contract (Kim and Laskowski, 2017; Lu and Xu, 2017) on the 
supply chain performance was not explored. Future studies can address 
this gap, by adapting our model. Finally, our model was tested in one 
developed country and one emerging economy, but our study’s findings 
can be generalized only of more empirical investigations across the 
world are conducted. Thus, we encourage the logistics and supply chain 
community to continue to investigate the relationship between block-
chain and supply chain performance. 


7. Conclusion 


The primary objective of this study was to show strong empirical 
evidence of the relationship between blockchain and supply chain per-
formance in two selected countries, with the hope that the results ob-
tained may serve as a catalyst for further research and be generalized. 
Our proposed research model was strongly supported by the results 
obtained. In fact, they indicated that knowledge sharing and trading 
partner pressure are good predictors of blockchain adoption in the In-
dian and US contexts. Additionally, our results highlighted the impor-
tance of supply chain transparency and blockchain transparency, both of 
which are important antecedents of supply chain performance. These 
results are in line with theory, which highlighted the benefits of block-
chain in supply chains, including an improvement of performance 
(Wang et al., 2019; Kamble et al., 2019). 


These results have potential managerial and theoretical implications. 
From a managerial lens, our model showed the value and influence of all 
constructs on supply chain performance, as well as the impact of the 
relationship between blockchain adoption and supply chain perfor-
mance on firm’s competitiveness. It further suggests to managers to 
deploy more efforts to enhance their understanding of this relationship. 
In terms of theoretical approach, we showed to the logistics and supply 


chain management community the strong relationship existing between 
blockchain and supply chain performance, the needs for a more im-
pactful role, and robust empirical studies that can help tackle the new 
challenges of the digital age. Thus, we opened up a new research avenue 
for scholars and practitioners interested in improving the understanding 
of the relationship between blockchain and supply chain performance in 
other areas and contexts. Finally, by comparing respondents from the 
manufacturing industry to respondents from other industries, we found 
no evidence for a moderation effect of the industry variable on the re-
sults. Moreover, our sample composition could not allow us compare 
respondents from a greater number of industry types from an intersec-
toral perspective. This analysis could instigate future studies to further 
the investigation of the link between blockchain and supply chain per-
formance. Investigating also the particularities of other countries 
through industry respondents seems to be another important research 
direction.
