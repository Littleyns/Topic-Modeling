Over the past two decades, digitalization has revolutionized not only consumer marketing but also industrial 
marketing. Both industrial marketing scholars and industrial marketers seek insights to understand how our 
knowledge and practice of digital marketing has been structured and configured. To address this gap, we adopt 
the resource-based perspective as an organizing framework and systematically review 129 articles spanning two 
decades of research to identify different digital marketing capabilities in industrial firms. From this analysis, we 
identify four themes: channels, social media, digital relationships, and digital technologies. We then stress-test 
this knowledge with managerial practices by conducting an online survey of 169 managers, designed to establish 
the repertoire of current and future marketing capability needs of industrial firms. Herein, we identify two 
marketing capabilities gaps: the practice gap—which identifies the deficit between managers' ‘current’ practices 
and their ‘ideal’ digital marketing capabilities; and, the knowledge gap—which demonstrates a significant divide 
between the digital marketing transformations in industrial firms and the extant scholarly knowledge that un-
derpins this. Based on these results, we build an agenda for future research on digital marketing capabilities.   


1. Introduction 


Over the past two decades, digitalization has revolutionized not 
only consumer marketing but also industrial marketing. E-Commerce, 
mobile devices, smart products, the Internet of Things (IoT), and 
Artificial Intelligence all fall within the broader concept of digital 
marketing which includes all activities, institutions, and processes fa-
cilitated by digital technologies for creating, communicating, and de-
livering value for customers (American Marketing Association, 2013). 
The growing importance of digital marketing in the industrial context is 
underscored in several recent B2B marketing trends (e.g., Gupta, 2018;  
Janda, 2018; O'Neill, 2018). For example, industrial marketers intensify 
their content marketing, employ more often marketing automation 
platforms, increasingly use chatbots for customer interactions, and 
search for new prospects on social media sites. Against these develop-
ments, our paper seeks to advance the understanding of how digitali-
zation has shaped and will reformulate marketing in industrial firms. 


While some researchers have already offered literature reviews of 
digital, social media, and mobile marketing (e.g., Kannan & Li, 2017;  
Lamberton & Stephen, 2016; Yadav & Pavlou, 2014), all these studies 


exhibit three shortcomings that prevent them to fully inform the in-
dustrial marketing field. First, these literature reviews have an implicit 
business to consumer focus, largely neglecting the specific context of 
industrial firms. Notable exceptions are reviews that focus on subtopics 
within industrial marketing such as social media use of industrial firms 
(Salo, 2017) or the impact of digitalization on salespeople (Singh et al., 
2019). Second, most attention has been given to the tremendous op-
portunities digital marketing presents, with little attention on the actual 
related competences that firms need to be successful. We believe that 
resource-based theory has the potential to bridge this gap and to guide 
industrial managers on how to benefit from digitalization. Viewing 
industrial firms as a bundle of capabilities (Barney, 1991) helps to 
identify, build, and sustain sources of competitive advantage in the new 
normal of our digital era. Third, existing literature reviews focus on 
published research only, thereby neglecting the accelerating emergent 
of “new” digital capabilities in managerial practice. This is trouble-
some, especially given the speed at which digital technologies evolve 
and impact business opportunities. 


We address these gaps by reviewing 129 high-quality articles that 
investigate digital marketing capabilities and related resources, by

confronting 169 managers with the results of the literature review, and 
by building a future research agenda for the industrial marketing field. 
Our objectives for this paper are three-fold. First, we address the “what 
do we know of digital marketing capabilities” question of prior research 
and develop a framework for industrial marketing research which 
highlights how the literature on digital capabilities and resources has 
evolved over the past two decades. Second, we pose the question of 
“which digital marketing capabilities will drive future value” and respond 
by creating insights from a management survey. Finally, we consider 
“how can the digital marketing capabilities gap be reconciled” by revealing 
several shortcomings of extant research that have hitherto constrained 
its relevance and created points of disconnect between academia and 
practice; thereby informing our agenda for interesting, relevant, and 
forward-looking digital marketing research for industrial firms. 


2. Conceptual development 


Resource-based theory offers a valuable framework to investigate 
digital business strategies and their consequential competitive ad-
vantages (Bharadwaj, El Sawy, Pavlou, & Venkatraman, 2013). More 
generally, resource-based theory explains the development of a firm's 
competitive advantage based on capabilities (or competences), defined 
as a set of “skills and resources which enable the company to achieve 
superior performance” (Harmsen & Jensen, 2004, p. 535) in a way that 
is difficult for competitors to imitate (Barney, 1991). Although the in-
dustrial marketing literature has often employed the resource-based 
approach as an important theoretical platform (e.g., Morgan, Miočević, 
& Herhausen, 2019), it is surprisingly scarce in digital marketing re-
search. 


In line with Guesalaga, Gabrielsson, Rogers, Ryals, and Cuevas 
(2018), we distinguish resources from capabilities to analyze digital 
marketing in industrial firms. Helfat and Peteraf (2003, p. 999) describe 
a resource as “an asset or input to production (tangible or intangible) 
that an organization owns, controls, or has access to on a semi-per-
manent basis,” and a capability as “the ability of an organization to 
perform a coordinated set of tasks, utilizing organizational resources, 
for the purpose of achieving a particular end result.” The distinction of 
resources and capabilities offers an appropriate lens for studying digital 
marketing because its success depends on the management of assets 
(e.g., a large data set) and the ability to undertake specific tasks and 
processes (e.g., machine learning to uncover meaningful insights). 
Consequently, we define a digital marketing resource as a digital-related 
marketing asset (tangible or intangible) that a B2B firm owns, controls, 
or has access to on a semi-permanent basis. Moreover, a digital mar-
keting capability is the ability of a B2B firm to perform a coordinated set 
of digital-related tasks (operational or dynamic), utilizing digital re-
sources, for achieving a competitive advantage. 


Importantly, in the digital context, resources often fail to meet the 
theoretical requirements to be classified as a resource namely being 
inimitable, rare, valuable, and non-substitutable (Lambrecht & Tucker, 
2015). For example, data that are available due to user-generated 
content reflecting digital behavior across the Internet can be scraped 
with low costs from many sites, and other sites sell their user data or 
allow firms to take advantage of user data through targeted advertise-
ment. Consequently, such data are neither inimitable nor rare, and due 
to its access by competitors not necessarily valuable. Given multiple 
providers of data and access (e.g., Google versus Facebook), such data 
are neither non-substitutable. Indeed, the unstable history of digital 
business with examples such as Yahoo or Netscape offers little evidence 
that the mere possession of digital resources is sufficient for value 
creation and a competitive advantage. The focus of a digital marketing 
strategy should therefore be on how to use digital resources as inputs 
which, in turn, create capabilities from which value and competitive ad-
vantage can be derived. Consequently, we mainly focus in our review on 
digital marketing capabilities because these endow firms with the 
means to adapt to market changes that stem from digitalization, new 


technologies, and changing consumer behavior (Day, 2011). We thus 
complement existing reviews1 by focusing on digital marketing cap-
abilities for industrial firms by asking: (1) what do we know of digital 
marketing capabilities; (2) which digital marketing capabilities will 
drive future value; and, (3) how can the digital marketing capabilities 
gap be reconciled. 


3. Literature review 


3.1. Identifying relevant articles 


We conducted a systematic literature review to explore the cap-
abilities that underpin digital marketing in industrial firms. Our goal 
was to identify and classify all critical digital marketing capabilities 
(and resources). Consistent with other systematic reviews, we limit our 
review to high-quality sources that align with the study context. To this 
end, all sources needed to explicitly fall within the scope of marketing 
and to ensure that all articles included met a threshold of quality as 
determined by journal centrality and academic standing. We thus 
considered the following nine journals for the literature review: 
Industrial Marketing Management; International Journal of Research in 
Marketing; Journal of Business Research; Journal of Interactive Marketing, 
Journal of Marketing Research; Journal of Marketing; Journal of Personal 
Selling & Sales Management; and Journal of the Academy of Marketing 
Science. In line with other reviews of digital marketing (e.g., Kannan & 
Li, 2017; Lamberton & Stephen, 2016), we considered all articles 
published after 2000 until the time of this review (i.e., mid-2019).2 A 
total of 129 articles qualified for extraction and synthesis, with the 
majority of articles being attributable to Industrial Marketing Manage-
ment (99 articles, 77% of all articles). 


3.2. Classifying digital marketing capabilities 


All digital marketing capabilities and resources in each of the 129 
articles were classified according to their broader topic. Thus, we coded 
each article's constructs of interest into a set of common topics for the 
purposes of our analysis. The authors resolved any differences of the 
coding scheme through iteration and discussion. We identified 147 
appearances of specific digital marketing capabilities or resources for 
industrial firms. Several topics of domain-specific capabilities were 
condensed and revised. For example, capabilities such as “use of social 
networking sites,” “social media messaging,” and “social media 
knowledge” were classified as “social media capabilities.” These efforts 
resulted in seven first-order topics that we subsequently distilled to four 
second-order themes. Table 1 presents the research topics and themes, 
the number of appearances per topic, and illustrative examples for 
capabilities and resources. 


Given clear and apparent themes that emerged from the topics 
considered during the census period, we use four intervals to 


1 Yadav and Pavlou (2014) focus on marketing in computer-mediated en-
vironments and review literature in both marketing and information systems. 
The review by Lamberton and Stephen (2016) focuses on consumer psychology, 
motivations, and expressions in digital environments. The review by Kannan 
and Li (2017) focuses on the touchpoints in the marketing process where digital 
technologies are having and will have a significant impact. 


2 We conducted searches in citation databases for the respective journals 
(EBSCO, Science Direct, Emerald, and Web of Knowledge), using the following 
search terms in the abstract: (“Internet” OR “electronic” OR “online” OR “di-
gital” OR “social media” OR “mobile”) AND (“industrial” OR “B2B” OR “busi-
ness to business”). This initial keyword search resulted in a set of 225 articles 
published in the eight journals, which we then filtered based on their relevance. 
All papers not addressing capabilities or resources and all papers without an 
industrial marketing context were excluded. The authors resolved any differ-
ences through iteration and discussion, with reference to the full text of the 
articles under consideration.

characterize the shifting focus of industrial marketing research on di-
gital marketing capabilities. In line with previous literature reviews 
(e.g., Guesalaga et al., 2018; Lamberton & Stephen, 2016), we divided 
our census period into different intervals (see Fig. 1 and Table 2). 
Studies published from 2000 to 2004 predominantly focus on the rise of 
the online channel, accounting for 77% of all digital capabilities con-
sidered during the census period. While many studies published from 
2005 to 2009 still investigated the online channel, its interplay with 
other channels gained importance. Many publications shifted its focus 
to multichannel capacities, in particular to the coordination and in-
tegration of the online channel with other channels. During the years 
2010–2014, deepening digital relationships was the main theme. This 
includes both interfirm relationships and intrafirm relationships to 
employees. Contemporary studies published from 2015 to 2019 are 
characterized with three dominant topics, namely mobile, social media, 
and digital technologies. Similar to the B2C domain, it is apparent that 
the total number of publications devoted to digital capabilities in in-
dustrial marketing has increased considerably in more recent years. Our 
literature review continues with an explication of the four digital 
marketing capability themes. 


3.2.1. Channels 
Most of the earlier research on digital capabilities falls under the 


first theme of channels—consisting of online channel (48 articles), 
multichannel (12 articles), and mobile capabilities (three arti-
cles)—defined as the customer contact points or the mediums through 
which the firm and the industrial customer interact. Out of the 63 ar-
ticles, 26 are conceptual; 6 use qualitative methods; and 31 articles use 
quantitative methods. The intellectual legacy of channel capabilities is 
dominated by the conceptual/theoretical understanding how the 
Internet provides a new gateway for industrial buyer-seller exchanges 
through various types of emerging online channel capabilities and re-
sources. The advent of the Internet inherently transformed the con-
ception how B2B transactions were conducted (Sharma, 2002). For 
example, industrial marketing researchers examined how Internet use 
enhances firm level processes and performance (Avlonitis & Karayanni, 
2000) and changes marketing activities such as managing sales (Long, 
Tellefsen, & Lichtenthal, 2007) and communications (Lichtenthal & 
Eliaz, 2003). 


Scholars also discussed the plausibility of adding web portals as a 
new resource to B2B strategies (Clarke III & Flaherty, 2003). For ex-
ample, Perry and Bodkin (2002) study reveals crucial determinants of 
how deep industrial firms engage in website marketing. In terms of 
managing the firm's own website as a channel, Deeter-Schmelz, 
Kennedy, and Goebel (2002) investigated how firms utilize the Internet 
as a communication tool in buying-selling dyads. Ellinger, Lynch, and 
Hansen (2003) demonstrate that industrial firms with higher invest-
ments in website interactivity witness higher sales revenues payoff. 
Besides for communication, scholars have found that industrial firms 
that use websites for expressing their corporate brands report higher 
financial performance (Simoes, Singh, & Perin, 2015). Most recently, 


others have revealed the value of corporate blogging as an emerging 
capability for B2B professionals (Thakur & AlSaleh, 2018), potentially 
signaling more research on emerging communication capabilities. 


The increasing diffusion of the Internet in the B2B sphere has en-
abled many industrial firms to establish their own online channels 
which resulted in disintermediation and the genesis of e-commerce. In 
an early phase, researchers started to investigate the motivation and 
abilities of industrial firms to participate in e-commerce as sellers 
(Grewal, Comer, & Mehta, 2001) and buyers (Kennedy & Deeter- 
Schmelz, 2001). As e-commerce started to gain momentum, researchers 
engaged in revealing the structural idiosyncrasies (Dou & Chou, 2002) 
and underlying marketing capabilities (Siu, 2002) of successful e- 
commerce adoption. Furthermore, studies show the importance of the 
IT infrastructure in determining e-commerce activities (Claycomb, Iyer, 
& Germain, 2005; Min & Galle, 2003). 


As a new form of market making, authors discussed the (dis)ad-
vantages (Jap, 2002) as well as the cost saving potentials (Emiliani, 
2004) of online auctions and reverse auctions. Online (reverse) auctions 
have been considered market making mechanism that disrupts tradi-
tional buyer-seller industrial relationships by putting the price in the 
spotlight as a critical cue in making buying decision (Emiliani, 2005). 
By furthering the principle of “cost savings”, authors warned that it is 
possible for online auctions to enhance long-term relationships between 
its constituents while simultaneously lowering the costs of transactions 
(Daly & Nath, 2005). 


At the same time while entering the online domain, industrial firms 
continued to maintain their traditional channels. This led researchers to 
scrutinize how to successfully develop multichannel capabilities (Sharma 
& Mehrotra, 2007) while successfully integrating and optimizing all 
online and offline channels (Rosenbloom, 2007). B2B firms that extend 
to online channels face challenges of optimization in their general 
business strategy but witness higher financial performance (Cheng, 
Tsao, Tsai, and Tu, 2007; Kabadayi, Eyuboglu, & Thomas, 2007). In 
parallel, scholars made first attempts to unfold what drives the B2B 
buyer's decision to engage in multichannel purchasing (Merrilees & 
Fenech, 2007) as well as B2B sellers' view how they could exploit the 
B2B multichannel engagement (Müller, Pommeranz, Weisser, & Voigt, 
2018). 


With growing importance of the Internet, the phenomenon of re- 
intermediation emerged where new types of online intermediaries in 
the form of electronic marketplaces appeared, and industrial firms need 
to build capabilities to deal with them. As a new phenomenon, scholars 
sought to assess the incidence of electronic marketplaces employed by 
industrial firms (Fu, Chao, Chang, & Chang, 2008). Following on from 
this work, empirical evidence became a substantive means of under-
standing when e-marketplace makers should engage in specific gov-
ernance mechanism with a goal of enhancing e-marketplace perfor-
mance (Grewal, Chakravarty, & Saini, 2010). Most recently, scholars 
have investigated the evolution of two-sided online platforms, which 
simultaneously operate in both B2C and B2B streams (Muzellec, 
Ronteau, & Lambkin, 2015). By identifying that the supply side of two-

sided platforms is under-researched, these scholars contributed to 
better understanding the opportunities and challenges for businesses 
that offer products and services through such platforms (Lim, 2017). 
Concurrently, scholars found evidence that engagement in B2B online 
platforms creates early mover advantage benefits but only for short 
period (Deng & Wang, 2016). 


A small number of studies have explored the potential dark side 
associated with B2B online exchanges. These report that conflicts may 
surface with the implementation of demand-side e-commerce solutions 
(Osmonbekov, Bello, & Gilliland, 2009). Since privacy may be violated, 
researchers have examined how to enhance trust in e-commerce set-
tings (Luo, 2002). However, this work has been transcended given 
ubiquitous computing in B2B markets (e.g., with IoT technologies) and 
more recent investigations on data privacy in B2C settings (Martin, 
Borah, & Palmatier, 2017), industrial marketing research is needed that 
addresses this important topic. 


As technology advanced, mobile media became an important channel 
for B2B firms. For example, Spreer and Rauschnabel (2016) identified 
six factors that inhibit the use of mobile devices in sales assistance. In 
addition, others have investigated the benefits of using mobile apps as a 
resource for customer engagement and found that such initiatives result 
in higher sales through empowering business customer to participate 
(Gill, Sridhar, & Grewal, 2017). Recent studies have started to shed 
light on the multichannel capabilities needed to integrate mobile and 
social media into a firm's existing marketing channels (Thaichon, 
Surachartkumtonkun, Quach, Weaven, & Palmatier, 2018). 


3.2.2. Social media 
A second theme, associated with 31 articles, focuses on digital 


capabilities that are specific to social media, which are defined as di-
gital communication platforms and services that allow parties to con-
nect with one another, to share information, and engage in dialogue. 
These include social networking sites, collaborative projects, blogs, 
content communities, and virtual worlds (Kaplan & Haenlein, 2010). 
Industrial marketing publications related to social media capabilities 
started to appear after 2010, and research on this topic was sub-
stantially stimulated by a special issue in the Journal of Personal Selling 
& Sales Management in 2012 and two special sections of Industrial 
Marketing Management in 2016 and 2019. Although a relatively young 
research stream, social media in the field of industrial marketing has 
already evoked an informative literature review (Salo, 2017). While 
that literature review sheds light on the opportunities of social media 
for industrial firms, it does not address social media-related capabilities 
and resources as we do. Out of the 31 articles identified for our review, 
four are conceptual, seven use qualitative methods, and 20 articles 
employ quantitative methods. 


The preponderance of articles investigate the capability of industrial 
firms to use social media as a marketing tool and its related resources (26 
articles), on either the employee or the organizational level. On the 
employee level (i.e., salespersons, 14 articles), studies have mostly 
identified the expected utility, usability, and usefulness as primary 
reasons for employees to use social media, and improved market 
knowledge and a higher communication quality as the direct outcomes 
of social media use. Illustrative of this stream of research is Itani, 
Agnihotri, and Dingus's (2017) study in which the authors examine 
attitude towards social media usefulness as an antecedent and compe-
titive intelligence collection as well as adaptive selling behavior as 
outcomes of social media use. Other antecedents for employees' social 
media usage are individual proficiency and familiarity with social 
media tools as well as the organizational social media expertise 
(Guesalaga, 2016). All studies on the employee level report positive 
effects of social media use on relevant outcomes (e.g., Ogilvie, 
Agnihotri, Rapp, & Trainor, 2018; Rodriguez, Peterson, & Krishnan, 
2012). 


Research on the organizational level largely mirrors research on the 
employee level (12 articles). Perceived usefulness and ease of use 


motivate B2B firms to adopt social media (Siamagka, Christodoulides, 
Michaelidou, & Valvi, 2015), and higher communication quality is an 
expected outcomes of social media use (Wang, Pauleen, & Zhang, 
2016). Moreover, organizational social media use has been con-
ceptually and qualitatively linked to co-creating value (Trainor, 2012), 
interfirm cooperation (Chirumalla, Oghazi, & Parida, 2018), and net-
work creation (Quinton & Wilson, 2016). However, although all studies 
on the organizational level expect positive effects of social media use, 
no study so far has quantified a potential organizational performance 
effect for B2B firms. This might be the reason for an interesting 
paradox. Despite the high interest in social media for industrial firms in 
academia and practice (e.g., O'Neill, 2018), an early study found that a 
majority of B2B companies considered social media use as irrelevant for 
them (Michaelidou, Siamagka, & Christodoulides, 2011), and a more 
recent survey found little evidence that this has changed: B2B managers 
perceived social media as less important and less effective than other 
managers (Iankova, Davies, Archer-Brown, Marder, & Yau, 2019). 
Moreover, there is little research on the microfoundations of social 
media use, in other words the processes and routines that enable B2B 
firms to engage in social media conversations. 


Four articles investigate the content management capabilities of in-
dustrial firms, all on the organizational level. These articles shed light 
on the distinct semantic approaches (Mehmet & Clarke, 2016), distinct 
functions (Leek, Canning, & Houghton, 2016), and distinct commu-
nication strategies (Swani, Brown, & Milne, 2014) that underpin social 
media messages for B2B firms. Moreover, investigating different com-
munication strategies in business markets, Swani, Milne, Brown, Assaf, 
and Donthu (2017) found that the inclusion of the brand name, func-
tional and emotional appeals, and information search cues increases the 
popularity of B2B messages. Research is silent on the topic of what 
guides salespeople in their individual content management strategies 
when they use social media relevant for customer relationships (in 
particular LinkedIn). Finally, one article considers B2B online reviews as 
an important resource for industrial firms (Steward, Narus, & Roehm, 
2018). However, no further research is apparent on this valuable topic 
which lags the B2C context and for which there is no direct comparison 
(e.g., Bruhn, Schnebelen, & Schäfer, 2014). 


3.2.3. Digital relationships 
The third theme is devoted to digital relationship capabilities which 


we define as the dynamic and ongoing interactions between trusted 
parties that are interdependent and enable value to be appropriated by 
any actor. Twenty seven articles are attributable to this theme from our 
review. The majority of these were quantitative studies from a range of 
research designs (16 articles) through to qualitative studies including 
content analyses as well as case methods and interviews (9 articles). 
Two of these articles reported conceptual insights from agenda setting 
reviews on supply chain coordination (Garcia-Dastugue & Lambert, 
2003) and sales management training (Lassk, Ingram, Kraus, & Mascio, 
2012) in B2B relationship building. 


Digital marketing capabilities are largely derived from sources de-
voted to interfirm relationships as well as relationships with employees. 
These include digital supply chain management, managing virtual 
networks, collaboration marketplaces, governance mechanisms, and 
customer relationship management as capabilities related to interfirm 
relationships, and intra-firm relationship management, employee 
training, and the digital sales interface as employee capabilities. 
Although the majority of the articles considered relationships at the 
inter-organizational interface(s) as the unit of analysis (23 articles), 4 
articles examined relationships at the individual employee level. 
Scholarly attention was originally devoted to firm capabilities in their 
upstream digital relationships with the purpose of improving buyer-sup-
plier relations (Leek, Turnbull, & Naude, 2003), creating more timely 
communication (MacDonald & Smith, 2004), coordinating network 
performance (Gupta, Cadeaux, & Dubelaar, 2006; Gupta, Cadeaux, & 
Woodside, 2005), and ensuring improved supply chain coordination

(Garcia-Dastugue & Lambert, 2003). The early stages of B2B relation-
ships are characteristically chaotic for both sides of the exchange (La 
Rocca, Perna, Caruana, & Snehota, 2016). Relationships build through 
interactions and, evidently, digital technologies have provided the 
means to improve search, selection, and communication with upstream 
partners thereby facilitating greater coordination. Initially, digital 
technologies enabled firms to create rudimentary capabilities for in-
strumental purposes designed primarily to improve information sharing 
within supply chains (Bharadwaj et al., 2013). As relationships con-
solidated between firms, our knowledge of the impact of firms' cap-
abilities with digital marketing communications have been evaluated. 
Evidence indicates that personal relationships still drive interactivity, 
but the merits of digital relationships are that they are more favorable 
than impersonal communications because they allow rationality to be 
exhibited and reciprocal feedback to be created which are important 
drivers of relational satisfaction at scale (Murphy & Sashi, 2018). 


The nature of this work coincided with the greater adoption of 
technology from upstream coordination to begin to span the value 
chain. Thus, midstream digital relationships came to the fore by ex-
amining virtual networks, collaboration marketplaces, and governance 
mechanisms for collaboration. Topics that emerged here included em-
pirical works investigating e-market orientation (Shaltoni & West, 
2010), central actors in platform relationships (Laczko, Hullova, 
Needham, Rossiter, & Battisti, 2019), and governance mechanisms in 
electronic markets (Grewal et al., 2010) as interfirm capabilities. 


Of note here are the lateral and network relationships that Pagani 
and Pardo (2017) identify. Their work revealed that digital marketing 
capabilities enable three forms of related parallel effects being: (1) 
activities-linked centered digitalization leading to the optimization and 
coordination of existing activities; (2) resource-ties centered digitali-
zation leading to the combinations of new resources which, in turn, 
generate new activities; and, (3) actor-bonds centered digitalization 
leading to new bonds among actors not previously linked (p. 191). 
Furthermore, Wang, Potter, Naim, and Beevo (2011) investigated col-
laborative (as opposed to closed) electronic logistics marketplaces, 
which have evolved significantly since this time, and were among the 
first to analyze how such a system can be configured through the 
marketing integrations capabilities of information processing and col-
laborative structures. 


Downstream digital relationships provide the greatest number of ar-
ticles in the digital relationships literature because fundamentally, “one 
of the most important tasks in marketing is to create and communicate 
value to customers to drive their satisfaction, loyalty, and profitability” 
(Kumar & Reinartz, 2016, p. 36). Moreover, particular challenges and 
opportunities exist for delivering customer value using digital re-
lationships in the B2B setting. In this regard, B2B relationships go 
deeper—B2B journeys are longer and more complex and typically in-
volve many individuals; customization is widespread leading to greater 
coordination demands; and, the stakes tends to be very high in B2B 
digital relationships (Maechler, Poenaru, von Collenberg, & Schulze, 
2017). 


These downstream articles are generally more recent and provide a 
consolidation and synthesis of many of the previous burgeoning lit-
erature streams. The preponderance of topics reflect the ‘outside-in’ 
perspective in B2B marketing and are devoted to sales-based digital 
capabilities. These included: return on engagement activities within 
B2B relationships (Guesalaga, 2016); customer relationship manage-
ment in post-sales service (Agnihotri, Trainor, Itani, & Rodriguez, 
2017); as well as digital sales resources deployed to identify franchisees 
(López-Fernández & Perrigot, 2018). Sales-based studies are com-
plemented by intra-firm digital relationships such as the work by Li, 
Guo, Cao, and Li (2018) on internal branding, as well as the higher- 
order exploitation of resources deployed to deliver innovation 
(Hardwick & Anderson, 2019; Zahay, Hajli, & Sihi, 2018) and advanced 
coordination, collaboration, and integration capabilities between firms 
and platforms (Laczko et al., 2019; Mallapragada, Grewal, Mehta, & 


Dharwadkar, 2015). It is clear that the diffusion of the mature digital 
relationship adoption practices in B2C markets are diffusing to B2B 
markets, albeit at a slower rate. For example, Gill et al. (2017) in-
vestigate a mobile app that a tool manufacturer provides for free to 
engage its buyers and find that the app increased annual sales revenues 
by up to 23%. They identify, importantly, that the form and nature of 
organizational buyer participation intensity is the critical mechanism to 
deliver these returns. 


Regarding employee digital marketing capabilities, scholars have 
primarily considered individual competency of their roles fulfilling 
organizational routines. These efforts have explored the extent to which 
greater investments in sales training (Sarin, Sego, Kohli, & Challagalla, 
2010) and understanding how technological capabilities could support 
the sales environment (Marshall, Moncrief, Rudd, & Lee, 2012). Fur-
thermore, Lassk et al. (2012) explain how training influences a sales-
person's ability to manage technological change in the firm's sales 
strategy. Specifically, they find program formality is important to 
trigger training effectiveness provided the training is mandatory. Some 
resistance to digital marketing capabilities in sales was evident among 
older salespeople but overall when engaged, the training effectiveness 
delivers a series of behavioral- and outcome-based performance in-
dicators. 


3.2.4. Digital technologies 
The fourth research theme consists of 18 articles focusing on digital 


technologies. Eight of these articles are conceptual; four use qualitative 
methods; and six articles use quantitative methods. At the start of the 
century with electronic markets still being relatively novel, Grewal 
et al. (2001) focused on basic IT capabilities and discussed the im-
portance of the industrial firm's IT capabilities in order to be able to 
participate in such markets and to deal with the dynamic environment 
that often characterizes the digital world. As with any introduction of 
new technology, it is important that firms are ready to embrace such 
technologies (Vize, Coughlan, Kennedy, & Ellis-Chadwick, 2013). At 
that time, some firms were evidently more technology ready than others, 
which impacts the way they are able to capitalize on these new op-
portunities. 


Later publications reflected the development and increasing pro-
gress of electronic commerce, becoming later known as digital, tech-
nologies. Kuruzovich (2013) finds that sales technology resources are 
important for lead sales management in online channels. Such IT sys-
tems are designed specifically for sales processes and allow for more 
effective information management by the sales force. Sales organiza-
tions have been transitioning from traditional, outside sales forces, i.e., 
field sales, to structures that facilitate online sales management 
(Thaichon et al., 2018). The accompanying Internet technologies have 
taken fundamental data management software to intelligent, digitized 
selling, providing the resources needed for customer-centric relation-
ship management. Järvinen and Taiminen (2016) concur that mar-
keting automation plays an important role in increasing high-quality 
sales leads and the quality of such resources can substantially impact 
customer satisfaction and loyalty (Kingshott, Sharma, & Nair, 2020). 


Automation can significantly contribute to the generation of content 
that is personalized and thus more relevant to the target audience, in-
creasing chances of conversion. Moreover, in order to fully exploit the 
potential of digital marketing, it is important that industrial firms are 
able to assess how such activities impact performance. This calls for an 
alignment between the firm strategy and the metrics selected; a strong 
knowledge base and skills to utilize web analytics; and an organization 
structure that embeds a marketing metrics system as a resource 
(Järvinen & Karjaluoto, 2015). 


Social communication technologies extend sales technologies to an-
other level. While both theory and practice seem to be vastly skewed 
towards B2C applications, B2B practice is reorienting itself towards this 
new way of acquisition, lead generation, and relationship management 
(Janda, 2018). The use of social communication technology in B2B is

not new, but they have often been considered secondary to more tra-
ditional means of communication. Yet, the technologies underpinning 
social media offer new ways to connect firms, i.e., sales managers and 
their customers (Marshall et al., 2012). Social media can transform both 
the sales structures and processes (Moncrief, 2017) and extend the way 
relationships can be facilitated as their reach can be larger. As  
Coreynen, Matthyssens, and Van Bockhaven (2017) point out, digital 
technologies are an essential resource to support this transition, where 
different resource configurations can offer distinctly different ad-
vantages that range from industrial, commercial, and value-based 
propositions. 


While social media enables human interaction via a technological 
interface, recent developments in IoT technology presents new config-
urations including machine-to-machine interactions (Leminen, 
Rajahonka, Wendelin, & Westerlund, 2019). IoT resources and cap-
abilities allow for new, modular configurations, where components that 
can interact with each other independent of human intervention, which 
are likely to radically transform interactions between people, as well as 
people and objects (Sousa & Rocha, 2019). IoT technology can provide 
a supporting backbone in B2B communications where information can 
be exchanged between objects that deliver input for example for 
maintenance and support (Falkenreck & Wagner, 2017). 


When designed well, this can create smart ecosystems for custo-
mized solutions, which is often essential in B2B settings and helps 
manufacturing companies in their transition of moving from sales to 
services. For example, Suppatvech, Godsell, and Day (2019) develop 
four archetypes of IoT-enabled servitized business models, where IoT is 
used as a resource to create additional functions such as personalized 
services or to connect customers and assets in smart ways (e.g., loca-
tion-based services). While there are plentiful examples of IoT solutions 
in B2C by now (Ng & Wakenshaw, 2017), B2B firms are recognizing this 
potential as well. This is likely to lead to new business opportunities but 
also new risks, as loci of control are likely to shift (Sousa & Rocha, 
2019). IoT also can be used as a resource for facilitating new servitized 
models that are user-based (Suppatvech et al., 2019) and thus parti-
cularly interesting for any type of subscription-based payment. Re-
cently, Philips Lighting collaborated with Deloitte to create an IoT 
based system for one of the Deloitte offices, where Deloitte no longer 
buys lights, but a lighting solution that is owned and maintained by 
Philips, challenging the company to offer the most sustainable solution. 
Finally, in the solution-oriented business model IoT allows firms to offer 
integrated solutions specifically tailored to the customer's needs. In B2B 
this typically translates to maintenance and support as well as optimi-
zation solutions, where IoT can create unique configurations to more 
effectively build such solutions to support B2B firms in their core ac-
tivities and processes. Key to the success of IoT technologies the per-
ceived credibility and usefulness of such technologies by B2B channel 
partners (Falkenreck & Wagner, 2017). 


Artificial intelligence presents firms yet again with a technology that 
can significantly impact sales, both in the offline and online environ-
ment (Moncrief, 2017, Sousa & Rocha, 2019). Within that, big data has 
also led to new technologies and techniques to analyze new types of 
data, such as image, text or speech in different ways than before (Sousa 
& Rocha, 2019). By means of machine learning techniques, big data and 
predictive analysis that take future forward approach, firms are able to 
improve for example activities along the sales funnel, such as targeting 
and positioning (Syam & Sharma, 2018) but also customer churn 
management and eCRM (Gordini & Veglio, 2017). While AI is typically 
recognized as an essential element in B2B production and manu-
facturing, the emergence of robotics in customer-facing activities 
cannot be ignored (Martínez-López & Casillas, 2013). Today, robots 
start to work along-side humans, and at times even independently in 
various points of the value chain, including the front office (Sousa & 
Rocha, 2019). Ultimately, these technologies are indicative of a shift in 
decision making from humans to machines (Syam & Sharma, 2018). 


Finally, while the concept of virtual reality emerged already a few 


decades ago, only in recent years the true business potential of virtual 
reality technology for industrial firms has been recognized. Academic 
research has only begun to investigate the impact of virtual reality 
usage can reshape B2B firms and their market performance (Boyd & 
Koles, 2019). Virtual reality literally takes IT capabilities from 2D to 
3D, with recent breakthroughs in this field offering a new level of 
realism to this technology. VR has shifted from a technical to an ex-
periential focus, where “VR applications capture three-dimensional, 
computer-generated spaces that enable vivid and multi-sensory ex-
periences within rich media settings” (Boyd & Koles, 2019). 


4. Management interviews and survey 


4.1. Data collection 


A two-phase data collection process captured the managerial view 
on the current development and future importance of the digital mar-
keting capabilities. Phase 1 was aimed at evaluating and where needed 
refining, adjusting, and completing the list of capabilities and tech-
nologies derived from the literature review. This round consisted of a 
roundtable discussion of the first author with 17 managers during a 
university workshop. Participants all worked in marketing, sales, or key 
account manager roles and operated in various industries, including 
manufacturing, IT and technology, and professional services. 
Confronted with the four themes and an initial list of digital marketing 
capabilities and technologies based on the literature review, the man-
agers renamed some of the capabilities and technologies (e.g., platform

instead of E-marketplace), grouped some of the capabilities and tech-
nologies (e.g., channel integration and channel coordination into multi- 
channel capability), excluded capabilities and technologies that they 
deemed irrelevant in 2019 (e.g., E-readiness), and added new cap-
abilities and technologies (e.g., scraping and web crawling). The first 
author then reviewed the revised list of the digital marketing cap-
abilities, resolved any disagreements among participants in a group 
discussion, and consolidated all suggested changes. 


Phase 2 aimed to contrast the view of B2B and B2C managers on 
their digital marketing capabilities and technologies because previous 
research has found meaningful differences in how consumer and in-
dustrial firms approach digital topics (Iankova et al., 2019). We used an 
online survey in which participants considered the current situation in 
their firm and rated how well each digital capability or technology is 
developed within their firm (1 = not at all developed / 7 = fully de-
veloped), as well as the future importance of each digital capability or 
technology over the next five years (1 = further development is not 
important at all / 7 = further development is of uttermost importance). 
Additionally, they selected what they believed to be the most important 
digital capabilities or technologies for their marketing from a drop-down 
list (participants were provided with the opportunity to choose as many 
capabilities or technologies as they wished). We also asked all partici-
pants whether any important digital marketing capabilities or tech-
nologies were missing in the list and they were provided with an open 
option to enter this. 


A link to the questionnaire was distributed to managers via LinkedIn 
on the authors' profiles and via email among B2B and B2C managers 
from an alumni panel of the first author's university. A total of 169 
managers fully completed the questionnaire (106 B2B and 63 B2C 
managers). Table 3 contains the summary profiles of the survey re-
spondents. 


4.2. Survey results 


When comparing the data on the actual state and future develop-
ment, both B2B and B2C respondents clearly agree that almost all di-
gital marketing capabilities will become more instrumental in the fu-
ture (see Table 4). With regard to their currently most important digital 
capabilities for their marketing activities, both B2B and B2C managers 
selected their own company website and multichannel capability most 
often (Table 5). Additional channel-related capabilities that were pro-
minent include the use of third-party e-commerce for selling and pro-
viding a mobile app for customers. Regarding social media, the B2B 
managers named social media for organizational communication, taking 


advantage of positive customer reviews and reacting appropriately on 
negative customer reviews, salespersons' social media competency, and 
engaging in digital business communities. The importance of digital re-
lationships is highlighted by the identification of social and digital CRM 
technologies, digital selling tools, and implementing digital change as im-
portant capabilities. The importance of advanced data analytics relates 
to digital technologies. 


Moreover, when we compare the current development and future 
importance of digital marketing capabilities, we encounter meaningful 
gaps in many capabilities. Many industrial marketers are being chal-
lenged by a deluge of data that is well beyond the capacity of their firms 
to comprehend and use, as pointed out by the gaps regarding big data 
infrastructure for machine generated data and unstructured data, big data 
visualization, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and advanced 
data analytics (Table 6). Moreover, the survey revealed multichannel 
capability gaps, also in terms of providing a mobile app for customers, 
digital selling tools, and IoT technology. In addition, B2B firms have a 
capability gap when it comes to taking advantage of positive customer 
reviews. 


We also found some meaningful differences between the B2B vs. 
B2C perspective on digital marketing capabilities. Capabilities related 
to mobile apps, the management of customer reviews, and digital 
selling tools are much more developed in B2C firms, and B2B firms 
should learn from more advanced firms and adapt the obtained insights 
to the industrial context. The same applies to big data-related insights, 
such as machine generated data, cloud computing, and scraping and 
web crawling. On the contrary, B2B firms seemed to be more advanced 
than B2C firms in capabilities related to social media for salespersons 
and social CRM technologies. 


Finally, we also encountered some newly generated digital mar-
keting capabilities in the survey.3 Some of the B2B participants in-
dicated that they miss digital marketing capabilities on our list that are 
important to them. First, several additional communication channels 
were mentioned. For instance, e-mail marketing and newsletter marketing 
were highlighted as important communication channels to build and 
nurture customer relationships. Other participants indicated the in-
creasing importance of instant messaging such as WhatsApp, Viber, and 
Telegram for professional relationships. Nonetheless, in order to or-
chestrate multiple communication channels, several participants

(participants selected 1 to 19 digital marketing capabilities).

author team from answers to the question whether any important digital 
marketing capabilities or technologies were missing in the list.

pointed out that industrial firms need to better understand how to take 
advantage of marketing automation platforms. Second, the role of search 
engines and online advertisement in an industrial context has been 
highlighted, including topics such as search engine optimization, search 


engine advertisement, open ad auctions, programmatic advertisement, 
retargeting, and pay per click optimization. Third, some participants 
already experiment with paid social media and in particular influencer 
marketing in a B2B context, without a clear understanding whether and

how these digital activities pay off. Fourth, it was pointed out that 
online product configurators are important for B2C but so far overlooked 
for B2B firms although they could be used for similar purposes. Finally, 
chatbots offer the potential to make online conversations more efficient 
but are according to some participants not yet used for professional 
relationships. 


5. Discussion and future research agenda 


We contribute to the understanding of how digital marketing has 
evolved and will further mature in industrial marketing practices by 
using the resource-based perspective to identify different digital mar-
keting capabilities, by reviewing 129 relevant articles investigating 
these capabilities over the past two decades, and by confronting 169 
managers with the identified capabilities and the results of the litera-
ture review. We find seven categories of capabilities that can be 
grouped in four research themes: channels, social media, digital re-
lationships, and digital technologies. In the light of several short-
comings of the current state of research that have limited its relevance 
and created points of disconnect between academia and practice, we 
build a future research agenda of emerging research topics related to 
digital capabilities in the industrial marketing field (see Table 7). Due 
to the evolution of the Internet and the shrinking cost of communica-
tion, there is a widening gap between the accelerating complexity of 
markets and the capacity of most marketing organizations to compre-
hend and cope with this complexity (Day, 2011). This gap is evident 
when we compare the current development and future importance of 
digital marketing capabilities within the four themes. 


5.1. Channels 


Similar to the current developments related to channels that is lower 
in B2B than B2C (ΔB2B vs. B2C = −0.31), also research in industrial 


marketing lags considerably behind the omnichannel developments in 
B2C research. While the online channel has been studied and the im-
portance of multichannel strategies is recognized (e.g., Manser-Payne, 
Peltier, & Barger, 2017), a vast amount of research still departs from 
more traditional channel structures or concentrates on either the online 
channel in isolation (e.g., Gregory, Ngo, & Karavdic, 2019). For the 
online channel, optimization through tools such as SEO remains a 
challenge and a better understanding of how such tools and adver-
tisement (still) plays a role continues to be important. While most B2B 
managers consider the firm's own website as instrumental in their 
marketing strategy, this is rudimentary and multichannel capabilities 
are also a top priority for the future (ct. Hossain, Akter, 
Kattiyapornpong, & Dwivedi, 2020). 


What the value of each channel is in serving business clients, how to 
seamlessly integrate those channels in (existing) structures, and how to 
optimize conversion from one point to the next is far from clear from 
extant knowledge. Inspired by the developing literature dedicated to 
customer experience management in B2C (Kranzbühler, Kleijnen, 
Morgan, & Teerling, 2018), industrial marketers could benefit from 
developing more insights in what the value-in-use of various touch-
points (Maechler et al., 2017) is and what this entails for the optimi-
zation of the sales funnel. Specific topics of attention here are the use of 
mobile as well as the role of third parties. Mobile had long been in-
tegrated in the back office of many industrial firms, but the role of 
mobile applications in general and mobile as a sales assistant specifi-
cally is less well studied in B2B, despite its importance for practice 
(Archacki, Protextor, Barrios, & de Bellefonds, 2017). 


In the light of channels and touch point analysis, it is important to 
consider the role of third parties in aiding and/or complimenting the 
customer journey. Emerging trends in service research and B2C mar-
keting is stressing the importance of a network approach (Zolkiewski 
et al., 2017), where different parties that influence the customer in 
various stages of the journey should be explicitly considered, and the

discussion on owned versus earned touchpoints has yet to arise in in-
dustrial marketing. Third party-selling, while not a top priority, is a 
relevant theme in B2B and how to manage the implications of such 
partnership in a multichannel environment is an undeniable part of 
future B2B business. 


5.2. Social media 


Building on the role of channels and multichannel capabilities, so-
cial media capabilities warrant greater attention in their own right 
(ΔB2B vs. B2C = −0.12). Overall, this was regarded as a theme with high 
future importance, but also where most development needs to take 
place demonstrating a significant digital marketing capabilities gap. 
Again, this is a field that has developed at remarkable pace in B2C (e.g.,  
Herhausen, Ludwig, Grewal, Wulf, & Schoegel, 2019, 2020), and is only 
evolving in B2B (Bill, Feurer, & Klarmann, 2020). We might speculate 
that this is due to the fact that social media is often seen as a haven for 
consumers to interact with consumers and where consumer empower-
ment is considered superior to the role of the firm. Additionally, there is 
the traditional assumption that B2C is a high-volume customer market 
and B2B tends to deal with less customers and thus naturally geared 
towards more face-to-face interactions. That assumption however has 
been overhauled by the reality of contemporary industrial markets and 
customer expectations. 


There are several social media initiatives that focus specifically on 
B2B and business opportunities (e.g., Linkedin, Google Plus, and 
Slideshare). However, research in this area has devoted little attention 
to how interactions on such platforms can systematically fertilize (new) 
business opportunities. While social media is often recognized as a lead 
generator (Bill et al., 2020), some work has also pointed out the value 
of social media for relationship management (Ogilvie et al., 2018). 
Equally, others have proclaimed it as the new way of (net)working 
(Katona & Sarvary, 2014). Also, it is not clear yet what the micro-
foundations of social media use are that enable industrial firms to en-
gage in successful social media conversations. Social media often car-
ries connotations of being “personal” and the need to be authentic, 
which has led to some backlash for companies that have taken strategic 
direction towards their employees and their social media interactions, 
with customers or otherwise (Mehmet & Clarke, 2016). Hence it re-
mains unclear, what the role of the firm should be in developing social 
media strategies, how employees can be engaged in the right types of 
social media interactions, and how these translate to employee and firm 
performance. Early research seems to indicate that social media had 
value for industrial marketing, but how value creation and appropria-
tion via these platforms emerges and which contingencies play a role in 
this is an important avenue for further research. 


Corporate blogging was recognized as an emerging opportunity. 
While B2C practice as well as research on blogging, vlogging and in-
fluencer marketing has steadily developed into a mature field (e.g.,  
Hughes, Swaminathan, & Brooks, 2019), B2B marketers struggle with 
how to develop corporate blogging into a strategically relevant tool. As 
it is difficult to draw upon analogies from the B2C world, where just 
about any consumer can become a b/vlogger, research in this field can 
make a substantial contribution in exploring the mechanisms of how 
corporate blogging can become an influential communication strategy 
in industrial marketing. 


Specifically in relation to social media, the question arises how in-
dustrial firms can capitalize on the “voice of the customer”. From the 
start, social media has developed a strong stand in the reviewing 
sphere. In B2C, consumers consider social media as an important source 
of information and reviews, both positive and negative, are highly in-
fluential in the decision-making process (Rosario, Sotgiu, de Valck, & 
Bijmolt, 2016). Industrial marketers have yet to appreciate and em-
brace how this dimension of social media can be used effectively in 
B2B. Given that the decision making process in B2B is often sub-
stantially different from that of the individual consumer, it is important 


to understand which factors would drive the impact of such review 
platforms in industrial marketing and to what extent firms can strate-
gically influence these factors in order to capitalize on the review 
phenomenon in social media. Recent compelling insights by Bill et al. 
(2020) have found no fundamental support for the B2B salesperson 
social media use-customer loyalty relationship which challenges social 
media's role as a ‘game-changer’ (Kumar, 2015) and a ‘revolution in 
sales’ (Marshall et al., 2012). However, there are important con-
tingencies to this relationship Bill et al. (2020) identify, whereby cus-
tomer status and the size of the buying center exhibit significant posi-
tive relationship in enhancing loyalty. Consequently, social media 
adoption is not a panacea. Rather we need to examine the adoption 
practices and behaviors that trigger intermediate customer outcomes 
such as loyalty, lifetime value, and brand equity while recognizing that 
several contingencies potentially magnify these differential effects. 


5.3. Digital relationships 


Given the developments in the previous two themes, the theme of 
both inter- and intra-firm digital relationships emerges naturally as a 
point of interest. Relationship marketing has strong roots in industrial 
marketing (as indicated by ΔB2B vs. B2C = 0.05). However, personal re-
lationships are often equated with face-to-face interactions in B2B. Such 
a narrow understanding neglects that employees may also play a pivotal 
role of in digital interactions. For example, Herhausen, Emrich, Grewal, 
Kipfelsberger, and Schoegel (2020) provide evidence of the positive 
effects of employees' digital presence on customer loyalty, and Singh, 
Marinova, and Singh (2020) shed light on salespersons' influence tactics 
in digital negotiations. Moreover, there is the belief that the sales-
person's tacit knowledge is pivotal to successful relationship manage-
ment. In fact, attempts to transform to (digital) technologies to capture 
such tacit knowledge and manage relationships using a more data- 
driven approach often meets resistance from employees as they feel 
threatened by such transformational changes. Moving forward how-
ever, digital relationships are important in developing and sustaining a 
successful business, especially for those firms operating on an interna-
tional or even global level. In fact, as the scope of the firm increases, 
personal and customized interactions and solutions can be achieved in 
many different ways (e.g., online product configurators), especially 
when digital CRM capabilities are developed in the right way. Online 
product configurators allow organizational buyers to select from pro-
duct variants and construct a customized product solution manner. 
Building these capabilities at scale enables firms to provide mass cus-
tomization to products that are high complex. An example of this is 
Zeppelin's configurator that provides B2B customers of Caterpillar 
construction machinery the platform upon which to design configure to 
specific performance requirements. 


Cloud computing infrastructure provides B2B operatives on-demand 
network access to a pool of configurable resources. Commonly con-
sidered the responsibility of the Chief Digital Officer, decision rights 
over these and other new digital capabilities are becoming increasingly 
blurred. Whilst digital transformations is becoming seamless and core, 
important questions over the decison rights remain—who owns what, 
which processes, and what rules apply to understand the evolution of 
digital transformation. For example, Péladeau and Acker (2019) assert 
that: “Previously, Chief Digital Officer roles tended to be filled by 
people from market-facing functions, including marketing, customer 
services, sales, or distribution. Now, however, organizations are in-
creasingly seeking Chief Digital Officer s with strategy and technology 
backgrounds—those who are able to work at the C-level across func-
tional silos and who are capable of understanding the disruptions en-
abled by technology”. 


The same applies to better understanding how different digital 
marketing capabilities across the B2B firm's portfolio, both complement 
and/or substitute across these ‘new’ internal boundaries, interfaces, and 
interdependencies of the marketing organization with other functional 


D. Herhausen, et al.   Industrial Marketing Management 90 (2020) 276–290


286






areas in industrial firms. This question can be taken further by asking 
for which relational tasks can digital marketing capabilities be devel-
oped in industrial firms so as to reduce the reliance on personal inter-
action? Yadav and Pavlou (2020) pose a similar question for B2C 
contexts in order to better understand how relationships can alter 
within technology-enabled interactions. In setting management inter-
ventions then to develop such capabilities in B2B firms, it is important 
to understand clearly what are the sources of resistance to developing 
these at the individual employee level? 


5.4. Digital technologies 


Underlying all themes is the development of digital technologies as 
an essential resource feeding into digital capabilities, which is more in 
B2C settings (ΔB2B vs. B2C = −0.30). To fuel marketing automation 
(e.g., website and search optimization, CRM), it is important to un-
derstand how integrating intelligent sales technologies into the sales 
channel can nurture relationships and create a substantial advantage 
for industrial firms. The qualities of those technologies substantially 
impact customer satisfaction and loyalty (Kingshott et al., 2020), hence 
it is important to understand both the characteristics of the technology 
that will make it successful as well as those that will drive employees' 
optimal use of it. Even though not fully accepted yet, there are signs 
that the need for personal contact is changing also in B2B (i.e., more 
willingness to do business via digital technology; Tan & Ludwig, 2016). 
Future research might transfer the high-tech vs. high-touch debate from 
the service context to an industrial context (Wirtz & Zeithaml, 2018). 
Interestingly, while technology interfaces have typically been regarded 
as less personal and less rich, arising technologies such as VR might 
actually shift this discussion to a more experiential focus, also in in-
dustrial marketing as these technologies are offering vivid and multi- 
sensory experiences (Boyd & Koles, 2019). 


What is important to pay attention to in this digital transformation 
is the role of the employee and the negative consequences that such 
networks tend to be “always on” (i.e., 24/7 availability; Marshall et al., 
2012). Especially in competitive environments, employees' wellbeing 
might be at serious risk here, especially when at the same time digital 
transformation can be perceived as a threat to the employees' job (i.e., 
being replaced by technology). More and more attention is being de-
voted to this issue, especially in light of the upcoming IoT and AI 
technologies and their potential to transform business models alto-
gether (Huang & Rust, 2018). Along with these technology develop-
ments, it is important to understand the interplay of management skills 
such as innovation skills, leadership skills, management skills (Sousa & 
Rocha, 2019) to successfully translate these developments internally 
and externally. 


Given the complexity of industrial markets, the potential of AI and 
IoT might be even larger than for B2C. Such technologies can deal with 
far more complex problems than humans can, so the potential to shift 
boundaries and create new paradigms is substantial. However, this also 
implies that there are new risks to account for, “as loci of control are 
likely to shift” (Sousa & Rocha, 2019), not just to customers but also to 
systems and technologies itself, as they start to interact independently. 
Consequently, future research directions emerge that call for specific 
industrial context. 


5.5. Limitations 


Our literature review is necessarily ‘retrospective’, restricted to ex-
isting research topics, and subject to the limitations inherent in the 
original studies. Only few of the articles deal with performance out-
comes of digital marketing capabilities. For instance, many studies in-
vestigated the relationship between digital marketing capabilities and 
related constructs from a nomological network (e.g., social media use 
influences better collection of market intelligence online) but we know 
very little whether these digital marketing capabilities provide a 


positive return to investment (because building these capabilities can 
be costly) or whether they increase sales or another financial outcome. 
In addition, most articles do not consider contingency effects in the 
outcomes of digital marketing capabilities. Whereas “mainstream” 
capability research is already saturated with a contingency approach 
(Morgan et al., 2019), we hardly found any papers on digital cap-
abilities in an industrial marketing context. Such important nuances 
should be addressed by future research. Our subsequent interviews and 
the survey were designed to gain insight into the current development 
and future importance of digital marketing capabilities among practi-
tioners, none of which allows us to measure actual usage or outcomes. 
More fine-grained empirical studies could determine the relative per-
formance effects of different digital marketing capabilities for industrial 
firms, and a larger sample could examine industry-specific differences 
in the importance of the digital marketing capabilities. 


6. Conclusion 


Taken together, the literature review, the management interviews, 
and the survey revealed two marketing capabilities gaps: the practice 
gap—which identifies the deficit between managers' ‘current’ practices 
and their ‘ideal’ digital marketing capabilities; and, the knowledge 
gap—which demonstrates a significant divide between the digital 
marketing transformations in industrial firms and the extant scholarly 
knowledge that underpins this. We strongly believe that the current 
COVID-19 crisis further increases the opportunities and importance of 
digital marketing capabilities for B2B firms (e.g., Pedersen, Ritter, & Di 
Benedetto, 2020). Many governments implemented social distancing at 
large scales to limit spreading of the virus, and digital sales channels 
took priority during the COVID-19 crisis. Given that by the time we 
write this article there is no sign that personal meetings will be the 
norm again, B2B firms and B2B scholars need to close the digital 
marketing capabilities gap as fast as possible. We hope that our research 
agenda provide guidance for this endeavor.
