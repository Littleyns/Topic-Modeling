Abstract: In the frameworks of supply chain risk management, dynamics, and resilience, control theoretic 


approaches can be considered as useful tools to tackle the issues of performance achievement under opera-


tional and disruption risks. New analytics technologies in the framework of Industry 4.0, big data analytics 


and artificial intelligence resulted in the creation of new domains, i.e., cyber physical supply chains and 


supply chain risk analytics. As such two trends can be observed, i.e., integration of analytics into control 


theory (so called intellectualization of control) and integration of analytics into supply chain risk manage-


ment (so called cyber-physical supply chains and risk analytics). This study brings the discussion forward 


by integrating these two perspectives. It analyses how control theory can enhance the risk analytics in the 


cyber-physical supply chain. Based on literature and case-study analysis, the frameworks of cyber physical 


supply chain and risk analytics control are derived. In this setting, further development of interdisciplinary 


approaches to supply chain optimization and simulation with disruption risk considerations on the basis of 


control analytics is argued. Copyright © 2019 IFAC

1. INTRODUCTION 


In the frameworks of risk management in the supply chain 


(SC), dynamics, and resilience, control theoretic approaches 


can be considered as useful tools to tackle the issues of per-


formance achievement under uncertainty in regard to bull-


whip and ripple effects (Disney and Towill 2002, 2005, 


Dejonckheere et al. 2004, Disney et al. 2006, Lalwani et al. 


2006, Ivanov and Sokolov 2010, Spiegler et al. 2012, Ivanov 


et al. 2012, Ivanov and Sokolov 2012a, 2013, Ivanov et al.

2016, Ivanov 2018, Dolgui et al. 2018). Control theory has 


been widely used for studying multi-stage, multi-period dy-


namic production, logistics, and SC systems. A broad range 


of control theory applications can be explained by a rigor 


quantitative basis for feedback-based and optimal control 


policies including differential games and stochastic systems, 


stability of controlled processes and non-linear systems, con-


trollability and observability, and adaptation (Sethi 1978, 


Perea et al., 2000; Sethi and Thompson, 2000, Sethi et al. 


2002, Ortega and Li 2004, Sarimveis et al. 2008, He et al.

2014a,b,c, 2016a,b,c, Spiegler et al. 2016, Dolgui et al. 


2018). These tools can be applied for a wide range of discrete 


linear and stochastic non-linear systems with both stable and 


dynamically changing structures. New digital technologies 


Industry 4.0 provide multiple directions for future develop-


ment of control approaches to the SC domain. One of these 


direction is SC risk analytics that refers to usage of emerging 


analytics techniques to analyzing, monitoring, mitigation, 


identification, predicting, control, assessment, simulation and 


the disruption risks in the SC and to the recovery in the case 


of disruptions (Heckmann 2016, Dolgui et al. 2019, Dubey et 


al. 2019, Panetto et al. 2019, Hosseini et al. 2019). 


Industry 4.0 SCs evolve through adaptation and reconfigura-


tion of their structures. Therefore, structural dynamics control 


needs to be developed further (Ivanov et al. 2010, Ivanov 


2018). With the help of smart sensors and plug-and-produce 


cyber-physical systems, the stations in the assembly system 


are capable of changing the operation processing and setup 


sequences according to actual order incoming flows and ca-


pacity utilization. Levalle and Nof (2016) develop a link to

control can be used in supply chain resilience analysis. In the

ent customer orders may have individual machine structures, 


whereas the flexible stations are able to execute different 


functions subject to individual sets of operations within the 


jobs. Control approaches can be applied to job shop schedul-


ing in a customized manufacturing process and job sequenc-


ing of operations within the jobs in order to support flexible, 


distributed scheduling in the emerging field of Industry 4.0-


based innovative production systems (Ivanov et al. 2016b, 


2017). 


Feedback control principles, including new developments 


such as Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) are of 


vital importance in real-time manufacturing, inventory and 


shipment tracking & tracing control in combination with 


RFID, sensor, and blockchain transaction data. Other applica-


tions of real-time control are seen in the SC resilience area as 


well as production-inventory control algorithm advance-


ments. 


2. CONCEPT OF CYBER-PHYSICAL SUPPLY CHAIN 


According to Zhuge (2011), the evolution from the cyber-


space and systems to the cyber-physical-social space and 


systems can be described by three extensions.  It distin-


guishes two types of cyber spaces: the first one allows users 


to read the information in the cyber space like the Web, and 


the other one allows users to read and write information in 


the cyber space. Both rely on humans to add information to 


the cyber space in order to share it with others.  


The first extension to this basic concept depicts the extension 


of the cyber space to the physical space through various sen-


sors. Any significant information in the physical space can be 


automatically sensed, stored and transmitted through the 


cyber space. Internet of Things can be considered as a kind of 


cyber-physical space. 


The second extension is that user behaviors can be sensed 


and feedback to the cyber space for analyzing the patterns of 


behaviors, and humans can remotely control the actuators to 


behave in the physical space through the cyber space. This 


enables the cyber space to adapt his services according to the 


feedback since behavior change may indicate some psycho-


logical change.  


In the third extension, i.e., the cyber-physical system, not 


only individual’s behaviors, but also social interactions can 


be feedback into the cyberspace for further processing. Users 


are considered with their social characteristics and relations 


rather than as isolated individuals. Sensors are limited in their 


ability to collect all information in the physical space, so us-


ers still need to directly collect the significant information in 


the physical space and then put them into the cyberspace after 


analysis (including experiment). Users can also manipulate 


physical objects in the physical space, which can also be 


feedback into the cyber space to reflect the real-time situa-


tion]. Users’ status, interests and knowledge evolve with so-


cial interaction and operations in the cyber space.  


The afore-mentioned analysis can be presented as digital 


cyber-physical SC framework (Fig. 1).  


Analysis of digital SC framework allows formulating two 


important insights. 


2.1. From competition between the SCs to competition be-


tween the information services and analytics algorithms 


At the times of SCM introduction into the management prac-


tices, it was popular to say that the company is as good as the 


SC behind it. Christopher (2005) formulated the proposition 


that the competition is not between the firms but rather be-


tween the SCs. Today and looking at near future, the special-


ists say that the SC is as good as the digital technology be-


hind it. Consider two example to support this proposition.  


The first one is the logistics service provider UPS. Develop-


ment of additive manufacturing leads to the possibility to 


produce the modules, components and even end products at 


one place, and actually at any place in the SC (Khajavi et al. 


2014, Li et al. 2017).  This implies SC design changes, a 


lower number of supplier layers and suppliers as such, and 


the reduced need in transportation which is a threat for logis-


tics companies. UPS and SAP developed a joint technology 


which allows UPS to manufacture the items using 3D print-


ing directly at the distribution centers. This contributes to a 


faster and more efficient SC.  


Such an integration of production, sourcing and distribution 


is also positive for reactions to possible disruptions in the SC. 


The second example is blockchain technology. Contracts in 


SCs often involve multi-party agreements, with regulatory 


and logistic constraints. Further complexities may arise from 


operations in different jurisdictions, as well as dynamic fea-


tures embedded in the contracts. The flow of information in a 


SC plays a critical role in the efficiency of the operations. 


Regulatory processes (e.g. customs) can be expedited by im-


proving confidence in documentations. This, in turn, will 


reduce wastage, risk and insurance premiums.  


IBM and Maersk are collaborating to create trust and trans-


parency in global SCs. They develop a distributed contract 


collaboration platform using Blockchain technology. Maersk 


estimates that shipping a single container of flower from 


Kenya to Rotterdam needs nearly 200 communications. How 


to improve the efficiency of the global SC? In their approach, 


each distinct entity involves in the transaction are allowed to 


access this system. Shipping from the port of Mombasa re-


quires signatures from three different agencies and six docu-


ments, the smart contract will automatically generate after the 


system receive the signatures. Simultaneously, when the doc-


uments about inspection, sealing of refrigerator, pick up by 


the trucker and approval from customs communicated to port 


of Mombasa are uploaded, all the participants can see the 


data in the meantime, allowing the related entity to prepare 


for the container. 


These and further recent examples of digital technology ap-


plications to SCs (Ivanov et al. 2018b, Yang et al. 2017, Cav-


alcantea et al. 2019) allow for the new proposition that the

services and analytics algorithms behind the SCs. The ser-


vices may be ordered in packages or as individual modules.

ent customer orders may have individual machine structures, 


whereas the flexible stations are able to execute different 


functions subject to individual sets of operations within the 


jobs. Control approaches can be applied to job shop schedul-


ing in a customized manufacturing process and job sequenc-


ing of operations within the jobs in order to support flexible, 


distributed scheduling in the emerging field of Industry 4.0-


based innovative production systems (Ivanov et al. 2016b, 


2017). 


Feedback control principles, including new developments 


such as Active Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) are of 


vital importance in real-time manufacturing, inventory and 


shipment tracking & tracing control in combination with 


RFID, sensor, and blockchain transaction data. Other applica-


tions of real-time control are seen in the SC resilience area as 


well as production-inventory control algorithm advance-


ments. 


2. CONCEPT OF CYBER-PHYSICAL SUPPLY CHAIN 


According to Zhuge (2011), the evolution from the cyber-


space and systems to the cyber-physical-social space and 


systems can be described by three extensions.  It distin-


guishes two types of cyber spaces: the first one allows users 


to read the information in the cyber space like the Web, and 


the other one allows users to read and write information in 


the cyber space. Both rely on humans to add information to 


the cyber space in order to share it with others.  


The first extension to this basic concept depicts the extension 


of the cyber space to the physical space through various sen-


sors. Any significant information in the physical space can be 


automatically sensed, stored and transmitted through the 


cyber space. Internet of Things can be considered as a kind of 


cyber-physical space. 


The second extension is that user behaviors can be sensed 


and feedback to the cyber space for analyzing the patterns of 


behaviors, and humans can remotely control the actuators to 


behave in the physical space through the cyber space. This 


enables the cyber space to adapt his services according to the 


feedback since behavior change may indicate some psycho-


logical change.  


In the third extension, i.e., the cyber-physical system, not 


only individual’s behaviors, but also social interactions can 


be feedback into the cyberspace for further processing. Users 


are considered with their social characteristics and relations 


rather than as isolated individuals. Sensors are limited in their 


ability to collect all information in the physical space, so us-


ers still need to directly collect the significant information in 


the physical space and then put them into the cyberspace after 


analysis (including experiment). Users can also manipulate 


physical objects in the physical space, which can also be 


feedback into the cyber space to reflect the real-time situa-


tion]. Users’ status, interests and knowledge evolve with so-


cial interaction and operations in the cyber space.  


The afore-mentioned analysis can be presented as digital 


cyber-physical SC framework (Fig. 1).  


Analysis of digital SC framework allows formulating two 


important insights. 


2.1. From competition between the SCs to competition be-


tween the information services and analytics algorithms 


At the times of SCM introduction into the management prac-


tices, it was popular to say that the company is as good as the 


SC behind it. Christopher (2005) formulated the proposition 


that the competition is not between the firms but rather be-


tween the SCs. Today and looking at near future, the special-


ists say that the SC is as good as the digital technology be-


hind it. Consider two example to support this proposition.  


The first one is the logistics service provider UPS. Develop-


ment of additive manufacturing leads to the possibility to 


produce the modules, components and even end products at 


one place, and actually at any place in the SC (Khajavi et al. 


2014, Li et al. 2017).  This implies SC design changes, a 


lower number of supplier layers and suppliers as such, and 


the reduced need in transportation which is a threat for logis-


tics companies. UPS and SAP developed a joint technology 


which allows UPS to manufacture the items using 3D print-


ing directly at the distribution centers. This contributes to a 


faster and more efficient SC.  


Such an integration of production, sourcing and distribution 


is also positive for reactions to possible disruptions in the SC. 


The second example is blockchain technology. Contracts in 


SCs often involve multi-party agreements, with regulatory 


and logistic constraints. Further complexities may arise from 


operations in different jurisdictions, as well as dynamic fea-


tures embedded in the contracts. The flow of information in a 


SC plays a critical role in the efficiency of the operations. 


Regulatory processes (e.g. customs) can be expedited by im-


proving confidence in documentations. This, in turn, will 


reduce wastage, risk and insurance premiums.  


IBM and Maersk are collaborating to create trust and trans-


parency in global SCs. They develop a distributed contract 


collaboration platform using Blockchain technology. Maersk 


estimates that shipping a single container of flower from 


Kenya to Rotterdam needs nearly 200 communications. How 


to improve the efficiency of the global SC? In their approach, 


each distinct entity involves in the transaction are allowed to 


access this system. Shipping from the port of Mombasa re-


quires signatures from three different agencies and six docu-


ments, the smart contract will automatically generate after the 


system receive the signatures. Simultaneously, when the doc-


uments about inspection, sealing of refrigerator, pick up by 


the trucker and approval from customs communicated to port 


of Mombasa are uploaded, all the participants can see the 


data in the meantime, allowing the related entity to prepare 


for the container. 


These and further recent examples of digital technology ap-


plications to SCs (Ivanov et al. 2018b, Yang et al. 2017, Cav-


alcantea et al. 2019) allow for the new proposition that the 


competition is not between the SCs but rather between the SC 


services and analytics algorithms behind the SCs. The ser-


vices may be ordered in packages or as individual modules. 


The success in the SC service competition will be highly de-


pendent on the analytics algorithms in combination with op-


timization and simulation modelling. Initially intended for 


process automation, digital technologies now disrupt markets

and business models and significantly impact the SC man-


agement and engineering 


As such, new disruptive SC business models will arise where 


SCs will not more be understood as a rigid physical system 


with a fixed and static allocation of some processes to some 


firms. Instead, different physical firms will offer services of 


supply, manufacturing, logistics, and sales which will result 


in dynamic allocation of processes and dynamic SC struc-


tures. Indeed, this ideas is not really new. We can recall the 


virtual enterprises concept developed about 15-20 years ago 


(Camarinha-Matos and Macedo 2010).  


The SCs in virtual enterprises were expected to be formed 


dynamically thru so-called competence cell or agents net-


working (Ivanov et al. 2004, Teich and Ivanov 2012, Ivanov 


and Sokolov 2012b,c). In essence, the suppliers were inte-


grated in a tool that contained their technological processes 


and the related operational parameters (e.g., costs and lead-


times). A customer was able to place an order specification, 


and an automatic algorithm was able to find the suppliers 


needed to be networked to fulfil this customer order. So 


while the individual contributors (e.g., robots, sensors, RFID 


– radio frequency identification, agents, modular factories, 


etc.) are not really new, they are becoming more practical and 


companies more receptive to using them to stay competitive.  


In addition, an attempt to interconnect these local solutions 


using the progress in data processing technologies can be 


observed in practice. For example, with the help of smart 


sensors and plug-and-produce cyber-physical systems, the 


stations in the assembly system are capable of changing the 


operation processing and setup sequences according to actual 


order incoming flows and capacity utilization. As such, this 


trend calls for new principles and models to support SCM of 


such future factories.  


2.2. From decision support systems (DSS) to decision analy-


sis, modelling, control and learning systems (DAMCLS) 


The second observation concerns the quantitative analysis 


methods in SCM. In the past decades, simulation and optimi-


zation have played significant roles in solving complex prob-


lems in SCM. Successful examples include production plan-


ning and scheduling, SC design, and routing optimization, 


just to name a few. However, many problems remain chal-


lenging because of their complexity and large scales, and/or 


uncertainty and stochastic nature. In addition, the major ap-


plication of the optimization and simulation methods in the 


last decades was seen in the decision support, meaning that 


decision-makers were to manually provide the model input 


and interpret the model output. On the other hand, the rapid 


rise of business analytics provides exciting opportunities for 


the Operations Research and to re-examine these hard opti-


mization problems, as well as newly emerging problems in 


SC management. 


Examples of SC and operations analytics applications include 


logistics and SC control with real-time data, inventory con-


trol and management using sensing data, dynamic resource 


allocation in Industry 4.0 customized assembly systems, im-


proving forecasting models using Big Data, machine learning 


techniques for process control, SC visibility and risk control, 


optimizing systems based on predictive information (e.g., 


predictive maintenance), combining optimization and ma-


chine learning algorithms, and simulation-based modeling 


and optimization for stochastic systems.  


The application areas of SC Analytics can be classified in 


four areas, i.e.: 


• Descriptive and diagnostic analysis 


• Predictive simulation and prescriptive optimization

• Real time control, and 


• Adaptive learning 


Sourcing, manufacturing, logistics and sales data are distrib-


uted among very different systems such as ERP, RFID, sen-


sors, and blockchain. Big Data Analytics integrates this data 


to information used by artificial intelligence algorithms in the 


cyber SC and managers in the physical SC. For example, 


electronic retailers are using their extensive transactional and 


behavioral data of their customers to offer them new ways of 


trying, experiencing and purchasing their products.  


PwC is working with a large car company looking to intro-


duce autonomous vehicles for the public. Part of this work 


employs deep reinforcement learning to develop rules. To-


gether with simulation, deep reinforcement learning is used 


to determine ‘optimal’ decision rules that allow the vehicles 


to maximize efficiency while also satisfying customer trip 


demand. The software environment for the project uses the 


extensible and practical environment of AnyLogic multi-


method simulation software to lever the capabilities of DL4J 


for the deep learning environment. Autonomous cars are be-


coming more common and the features are already in many 


consumer cars. These examples show that artificial intelli-


gence becomes more pervasive in the real world with every 


project, and necessarily it must be part of simulation.  


With regards to SC risks, Resilience360 at DHL allows com-


prehensive disruption risk management by mapping end-to-


end SC, building risk profiles and identifying critical hotspots 


in order to initiate mitigation activities and alert in near-real 


time mode on incidents that could disrupt the SC (DHL 


2018).  


Finally, collaborative control theory is considered as one of 


the milestones in development of decentralized control sys-


tems (Nof 2007). The major idea of collaborative control is to 


com-bine decentralized agent-oriented control in the frame-


work of bio-inspired coordination and control, adaptation and 


learning. Nayak et al. (2016) extend the collaborative control 


concept in direction of decentralized resource sharing in the 


CPS setting. Moghaddam and Nof (2017) formulated the 


principles of collaborative factory of future through the col-


laborative control theory operators in order to address the 


challenges of scalability, resilience and sustainability. 





3. DIRECTIONS AND EXAMPLES OF CONTROL AND 


ANALYTICS COMBINATIONS 


Digital technology in the Industry 4.0 framework provides 


constructive basis to implement CT models and algorithms. 
CT is favorable in the cases of many dynamically changing 


control parameters, obtaining analytical solutions or proper-


ties, and in investigating different mutual impacts of SC 


planning and control parameters (e.g., demands, resource and 


channel capacities, lead-time, lot-sizes, and inventories) on 


the SC tactical and operative performance (i.e., service level 


and costs). In some cases (e.g., if many changes, many stag-


es, and many periods), it is convenient to transit from a dis-


crete problem statement to continuous solution procedure, 


and then represent the result again in discrete terms due to 


particular accuracy of continuous time models. 


The system control has two impacts upon the system. First, 


this is the tuning – the changing of uncertain coefficients in 


the structure of the differential equations of the system, tak-


ing account that the greater number of these coefficients im-


plies a more accurate system response to a changing envi-


ronment. Second, this is the learning – the imposing new re-


strictions on the system behavior. The number of arbitrary 


coefficients, in the structure of equivalent equations, changes 


in the process of learning, of consecutive imposing new and 


new restrictions on the system behavior.  In the systems with 


more than six variables the number of arbitrary coefficients 


increases first, and then, passing through the maximum be-


gins to decrease.  


This phenomenon makes it possible to explain the processes 


of system growth, complication and death. The existence of 


maximum adaptability phenomenon is observed in numerous 


biological, economical and physical-engineering systems. It 


is important that we describe a system with a full sum of 


combinations and have all the variants of decisions. The lin-


gual-combinatorial simulation is a useful heuristic approach 


for investigation of complex, poorly formalized systems. 





For technical formalization of the risk analytics in service-


oriented cyber-physical SCs (cf. Fig. 1), a complex of control 


theoretical models is currently under development that in-


cludes an optimal control model of dynamics service coordi-


nation based on the approach developed in (Ivanov et al. 


2012b, 2014b). 


4. DIRECTIONS OF SUPPLY CHAIN RISK ANALYTICS 


BY CONTROL 


Fig. 2 presents a framework that summarizes contributions of 


control analytics to SC risk management in a cyber-physical 


SC. At the risk analysis stage, descriptive and diagnostic 


analysis with regards to disruption impact analysis in the 


past, performance analysis, resilience analysis, and recovery 


analysis is performed. Control theoretic attainable sets can be 


used at this level (Ivanov et al. 2016a,b, Ivanov et al. 2018) 


The modelling stage is devoted to predictive simulation and 


prescriptive optimization. Structural dynamics control ap-


proach in combination with mathematical optimization can 


be used (Ivanov et al. 2013, 2014b, 2016). Real-time control 


area contains supply flow real-time control, disruption identi-


fication, and real-time performance and recovery control.  


It is commonly known that feedback control in socio-


organizational differs from technical systems where the feed-


back can be implemented almost immediately. In socio-


organizational systems, the feedback information first needs 


to be evaluated by managers and the adjustment decisions 


need to be coordinated among different department in the 


firms or even cross-organisational.

As such, the differences in the system states can be observed 


between the system state at the moment of starting to prepare 


the adjustment decisions on the basis of the feedback infor-


mation and the system state at the moment of decision im-


plementation. In other words, delayed feedbacks occur due to 


system inertia.  The correction (adaptation) decisions need to 


be implemented at the object or system which is different 


from the object or system that has been considered for the 


reconfiguration decision planning. 


Finally, learning stage is comprised of risk mitigation learn-


ing, disruption recovery learning, and disruption pattern 


recognition. A combination of control algorithms and artifi-


cial intelligence can provide a number of new insights in the 


given area. 


5. CONCLUSIONS 


In the frameworks of SC risk management, dynamics, and 


resilience, control theoretic approaches can be considered as 


useful tools to tackle the issues of performance achievement 


under operational and disruption risks. New analytics tech-


nologies in the framework of Industry 4.0, big data analytics 


and artificial intelligence resulted in the creation of new do-


mains, i.e., cyber physical supply chains and supply chain 


risk analytics.  


As such two trends can be observed as follows: 


 integration of analytics into control theory (so called 
intellectualization of control) and  


 integration of analytics into supply chain risk manage-
ment (so called cyber-physical SC and risk analytics).  


Control theory provides a variety of methods and tools for SC 


management and takes into account dynamics, real dimen-


sions, non-linearity and non-stationary of SC processes. In 


addition, with the help of control theory, non-stationary per-


formance indicators such as robustness and stability can be 


investigated in their fullness and consistency with operations 


planning and execution control with-in a conceptually and 


mathematically integrated framework.  


This study brings the discussion forward by integrating these 


two perspectives. It analyses how control theory can enhance 


the risk analytics in the cyber-physical SC. Based on litera-


ture and case-study analysis, the frameworks of cyber physi-


cal supply chain and risk analytics control have been derived.  


The derived frameworks show that the incorporation of intel-


ligent IT into CT, also known as intellectualization of control 


in the framework of digital SC and operations management 


control in Industry 4.0, can provide a variety of methods and 


tools for dynamics in the SC domain. This can become the 


area where the knowledge of SC and operations managers 


and control specialists can be effectively integrated taking 


advantages of modern IT, e.g., for investigating SC dynamics 


or applying RFID to SC monitoring and adaptation. 


Finally, a combination of control and analytics methods may 


have a potential to create pioneering solutions to SC and op-


erations reconfiguration based on the feedbacks. It is com-


monly known that feedback control in socio-organizational 


differs from technical systems where the feedback can be 


implemented almost immediately. In socio-organizational 


systems, the feedback information first needs to be evaluated 


by managers and the adjustment decisions need to be coordi-


nated among different department in the firms or even cross-


organisational.  


As such, the differences in the system states can be observed 


between the system state at the moment of starting to prepare 


the adjustment decisions on the basis of the feedback infor-


mation and the system state at the moment of decision im-


plementation. In other words, delayed feedbacks occur due to 


system inertia.  The correction (adaptation) decisions are im-


plemented at the object or system which is different from the 


object or sys-tem that has been considered for the reconfigu-


ration decision planning. Therefore, the need for proactive 


control models arises. There are a number of possible combi-


nations of control and analytic methods in this direction, e.g., 


attainable set and predictive analytics combination.
