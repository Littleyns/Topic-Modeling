1. INTRODUCTION 


The advent of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) 


that is built on digital technologies is rapidly transforming the 


supply chain (Ridgway, Clegg, and Williams 2013; 


Siemieniuch, Sinclair, and Henshaw 2015; Ben-Daya, et al., 


2017, Hofmann and Rusch, 2017; Ferdows, 2018, Ivanov et 


al., 2019). The traditional supply chain characterized by 


physical flows that move products and information from one 


end of the supply chain to the other (Mussomeli et al., 2016) 


is often visualized as a rigid arrangement of supply chain 


partners that handle different primary supply chain 


management processes. However, to take full advantage of it, 


companies need to break away from the traditional supply 


chain, with each step dependent on the one before it. 


Inefficiencies in one step can result in a cascade of similar 


inefficiencies in subsequent stages, which could result to a 


bullwhip effect (Lee et al., 1997). This results in waste and 


inefficient operation. 


Digital technologies have fostered a new era of 


competitiveness. Digital technologies allow for the 


integration of data and information from disparate sources 


and locations to drive the production and distribution of 


goods and services (Mussomeli et al., 2016). They are 


categorized under three broad areas, namely digital 


technology enablers, digital systems integrators and 


application technologies. The digital technology enablers 


provide the backbone that allows for the digital 


transformation of the industrial production (Gurria, 2017). 


These enablers include big data (Nguyen et al., 2017; 


Gunasekaran et al., 2017), Internet of Things (Atzori, et al., 


2010; Moeuf, et al., 2017), and cloud computing (Aviles, 


2015; Gantzia and Sklatinioti, 2014). Under the digital 


systems integrators are simulations, artificial intelligence and 


cyber-physical systems (Khaitan and McCalley 2015, Wang, 


et al, 2015, Monostori, et al, 2016). The application 


technologies are the applications through which the main 


productivity effects in industry are likely to unfold which 


include additive manufacturing/3D printing (Mellor, et al., 


2014, Durach et al., 2017), autonomous machines and 


systems, and human-machine integration (Gurria, 2017). 


Giving these layers of the digital technologies we argue that 


companies should first establish the digital enablers, followed 


by digital systems integrators and then finally the application 


technologies. 


The use of novel digital technologies allows companies to 


generate new forms of revenue and business value for 


organizations (Buyukozkan and Gocer, 2018). The quest for 


these novel technologies is not necessarily about the 


technology itself but their use to provide transformational 


effects on supply chain processes (Rai, et al., 2006; Xue, et 


al., 2013).  


Building on this concept, we define supply chain 


digitalization (hereafter, SC digitalization) as the extent to 


which a focal plant implements novel digital technologies in 


their supply chain processes to conduct business with its 


suppliers and customers and the degree to which these 


technologies transform supply chain capabilities and 


operational performance of the plant.  


In this paper we intend to develop a conceptual framework 


that describes the relationship amongst supply chain 


digitalization, supply chain capabilities and operational 


performance.

The advent of the fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) 


that is built on digital technologies is rapidly transforming the 


supply chain (Ridgway, Clegg, and Williams 2013; 


Siemieniuch, Sinclair, and Henshaw 2015; Ben-Daya, et al., 


2017, Hofmann and Rusch, 2017; Ferdows, 2018, Ivanov et 


al., 2019). The traditional supply chain characterized by 


physical flows that move products and information from one 


end of the supply chain to the other (Mussomeli et al., 2016) 


is often visualized as a rigid arrangement of supply chain 


partners that handle different primary supply chain 


management processes. However, to take full advantage of it, 


companies need to break away from the traditional supply 


chain, with each step dependent on the one before it. 


Inefficiencies in one step can result in a cascade of similar 


inefficiencies in subsequent stages, which could result to a 


bullwhip effect (Lee et al., 1997). This results in waste and 


inefficient operation. 


Digital technologies have fostered a new era of 


competitiveness. Digital technologies allow for the 


integration of data and information from disparate sources 


and locations to drive the production and distribution of 


goods and services (Mussomeli et al., 2016). They are 


categorized under three broad areas, namely digital 


technology enablers, digital systems integrators and 


application technologies. The digital technology enablers 


provide the backbone that allows for the digital 


transformation of the industrial production (Gurria, 2017). 


These enablers include big data (Nguyen et al., 2017; 


Gunasekaran et al., 2017), Internet of Things (Atzori, et al., 


2010; Moeuf, et al., 2017), and cloud computing (Aviles, 


2015; Gantzia and Sklatinioti, 2014). Under the digital 


systems integrators are simulations, artificial intelligence and 


cyber-physical systems (Khaitan and McCalley 2015, Wang, 


et al, 2015, Monostori, et al, 2016). The application 


technologies are the applications through which the main 


productivity effects in industry are likely to unfold which 


include additive manufacturing/3D printing (Mellor, et al., 


2014, Durach et al., 2017), autonomous machines and 


systems, and human-machine integration (Gurria, 2017). 


Giving these layers of the digital technologies we argue that 


companies should first establish the digital enablers, followed 


by digital systems integrators and then finally the application 


technologies. 


The use of novel digital technologies allows companies to 


generate new forms of revenue and business value for 


organizations (Buyukozkan and Gocer, 2018). The quest for 


these novel technologies is not necessarily about the 


technology itself but their use to provide transformational 


effects on supply chain processes (Rai, et al., 2006; Xue, et 


al., 2013).  


Building on this concept, we define supply chain 


digitalization (hereafter, SC digitalization) as the extent to 


which a focal plant implements novel digital technologies in 


their supply chain processes to conduct business with its 


suppliers and customers and the degree to which these 


technologies transform supply chain capabilities and 


operational performance of the plant.  


In this paper we intend to develop a conceptual framework 


that describes the relationship amongst supply chain 


digitalization, supply chain capabilities and operational 


performance.

2. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND 


The Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model was 


developed by the Supply Chain Council with the help of the 


top leading manufacturing companies. The SCOR model is a 


diagnostic tool for supply chain (Ntabe, et al., 2015) and a 


major framework that features supply chain management 


practices and business process reengineering (Lockamy III 


and McCormack, 2004; Wang, et al, 2010; Zhou, et al., 


2011). It is used to address, improve, and communicate 


supply chain management decisions within a company, its 


suppliers and customers (SC Council, 2004). It provides a 


methodology for managing supply chain activities and 


processes, which can be used as a set of practical guidelines 


for analyzing supply chain management practices (Li, et al., 


2011).  In this study, we offer an approach to operationalize 


the SCOR concept under the guides of digital technologies 


(DT) and seek to determine how DT can transform supply 


chain practices.   


Se eral Studies ( urria  01  Laaper  01  and Dall’ mo  


2016) have shown that digital technologies play a critical role 


in managing supply chain processes that generate 


performance gains for the respective firms. The foundation of 


digital transformation requires a complete understanding and 


holistic analysis of the internal and external capabilities (Uhl, 


et al., 2014). However, there have been limited academic 


research that investigate how and why digital technologies 


can create performance gains by improving and transforming 


supply chain capabilities. 


The digital technologies improve capabilities by allowing 


companies to trim operating cost, improve product quality 


while increasing sales revenue through expanding market 


shares, developing new products that meet customer needs, 


and creating strategic advantage that improve all business 


operations (Gurria, 2017). Researchers have recognized 


capabilities as an important source of an organi ation’s 


operational strengths and competitive performance (Flynn 


and Flynn, 2004; Peng et al., 2008). In the proposed 


framework, supply chain digitalization (SCD) serves to 


transform supply chain capabilities to improve operational 


performance of the firm. 


Supply chain capability is defined as the ability of a company 


to identify, utilize, and assimilate both internal and external 


resources and information to facilitate the overall supply 


chain activities (Bharadwaj, 2000; Wu et al., 2006). 


Capability studies have been used in recent supply chain 


research (Ferdows and De Meyer, 1990; Noble, 1995; Boyer 


and Lewis, 2002; Flynn and Flynn, 2004; Singh, et al., 2015) 


to reframe the conversation into how and why capabilities 


create performance gains for the firm. Capabilities studies in 


general are informed by resource-based view (RBV) of 


competiti e ad antage that focuses on a firm’s ability to 


consciously and systematically create distinctive capabilities 


which enable the firm to gain competitive advantage in the 


marketplace (Penrose, 1959; Wernerfelt, 1984; Hulsman et 


al., 2008; Yusuf et al  01 )   company’s resources pro ide 


the firm with unique capabilities that allow it to manage 


change and identify new opportunities (Barney, 1991).  


Specifically, we use the resource-based view (RBV) of the 


firm to ascertain how digital technologies can be explored 


and exploited to obtain a distinctive SC advantage. This 


theoretical perspecti e  while positing that a firm’s resources 


span across boundaries and are imbedded in inter-firm 


processes has changed the focus of competitive advantage 


from single organization to inter-organizational resources, 


thereby shifting from single organization to the entire supply 


chain network. 


It is confirmed that supply chain capabilities can improve the 


competitive advantage of the supply chain by integrating key 


business processes from the suppliers, through the 


manufacturing processes to the customers thereby improve 


business performance (Kristal et al., 2010). Zacharia, et al. 


(2011) found that collaborative process competence mediates 


the relationship between the absorptive capacity and 


collaborative engagement capabilities which subsequently 


have a positive influence on operations performance. Liao, et 


al. (2017) used supply chain capability as a mediator in 


establishing relationships among supply chain collaboration 


and value innovation, supply chain capacity, and competitive 


advantage. Wu, et al., (2006) conceptualized supply chain 


capabilities as a second-order construct that comprises of four 


dimensions: information exchange, collaboration, interfirm 


activity integration, and responsiveness. Rai et al. (2006) 


identified IT infrastructure integration for supply chain as a 


lower-order capability that can be leveraged to a higher-order 


supply chain process integration capability. These dimensions 


serve as the source of significant and sustained performance 


gains in a supply chain.  


Mckone-Sweet and Lee (2009) consider six supply chain 


capabilities, assessing both organizational and information 


technology (IT) dimensions. Mckone-Sweet and Lee’s 


definition of SC capabilities  corroborates u et al ( 00 )’s 


work on the impact of information technology on supply 


chain capabilities. Based on the foregoing we adopt Mckone-


Sweet and Lee’s definition of SC capabilities  which attempts 


to integrate both the organizational and IT capabilities, that 


emphasizes the involvement of the customer and supplier. 


Therefore, the digital supply chain capabilities are presented 


as comprising of six dimensions: coordination, planning, 


customer involvement, supplier involvement, IT exploitation 


and IT exploration. To that extent, we propose the following 


two research questions to guide the study: 


RQ 1  Does the use of digital technologies in the core 


supply chain management processes of SCOR model 


influence supply chain capabilities? 


RQ 2 To what extend does use of digital technologies 


enhance operational performance through their impact on 


supply chain capabilities.  


3.  RESEARCH FRAMEWORK 


In this paper we present a three-stage model that describes 


the relationship amongst supply chain digitalization, supply 


chain capabilities and operational performance. We draw on 


the SCOR framework to investigate the role of supply chain

digitalization on improving supply chain capabilities and its 


overall effect on operational performance (see Figure 1).  


In assessing the supply chain digitalization, we investigate 


the level of investment of digital technologies, current level 


of use and future directions of implementation of digital 


technologies (see Figure 2). Based on current use and future 


direction of digital technologies implementation, our goal is 


to unveil the transformational effect of supply chain 


digitalization on supply chain capabilities which will impact 


the overall operational performance.

Fig. 1.  Conceptual framework. 


The SCOR model explains the processes along the entire 


supply chain and provides a basis for how to improve those 


processes. It has been described as a promising model for 


strategic decision making in supply chains (Turhan et al., 


2011). The model has been widely adopted in many 


companies and anecdotal evidence and trade journals have 


reported significant improvements after firms adopt the score 


model (Zhou, et al., 2011). The basic building blocks of 


supply chain management processes in the SCOR Model are: 


plan, source, make and deliver. Within the context of this 


model, we investigate the extent to which the use of the novel 


digital technologies in the plan, source, make and deliver 


decision areas of the SCOR model influence supply chain 


capabilities which in effect enhance operational performance 


of the firm. 





Fig. 2.  Adoption of digital technology. 


We adopt the Mckone-Sweet and Lee’s definition of SC 


capabilities. The authors consider two aspects of 


organizational capabilities for internal integration — 


coordination and planning. Coordination is an indicator of a 


firm’s ability to integrate across business processes across the 


organization and planning is an indicator of a firm’s ability to 


integrate their internal planning process with information 


from other members of the SC. They also consider two 


aspects of organizational capabilities for external integration 


— customer involvement and supplier involvement. 


Additionally, the authors also emphasize the importance of 


two aspects of supply chain IT capabilities — the use of IT 


for Exploitation and Exploration. Exploitation is an inward-


looking tendency that focuses on operational efficiencies 


whereas exploration is outward-looking that seeks to gain 


better understanding of the environment and explore new 


ways to collaborate with customers and suppliers. Rosenkopf 


and Nerkar (2001) found empirical evidence that exploration 


beyond organizational boundaries had more impact than 


exploitation within organizations. Exploration typically 


involves innovations and risk taking while exploitation brings 


greater standardization and control to the supply chain 


(McKone-Sweet and Lee, 2009). Managing organizations for 


the simultaneous pursuit of exploitation and exploration may 


be a task of dynamic rather than static alignment (Siggelkow 


and Levinthal 2003, Westerman et al. 2006). Organizations 


need to continuously reconfigure their activities to meet 


changing demands in their internal and external 


environments. Maintaining an appropriate balance between 


exploration and exploitation, which promotes organizational 


ambidexterity, is a primary factor in system survival and 


prosperity (March, 1991). This supports adopting the IT 


capabilities through the lens of both exploitation and 


exploration. 


The final stage of the framework is to measure operational 


performance. We employed four first-order constructs, 


following Ferdows and De Meyer’s (1990) dimensions. 


Quality and cost performance were each measured using a 


single item, using the same items as Bozarth et al. (2009). 


Single-item perceptual measures are acceptable when the 


object of the construct is concrete, uniformly imagined 


(Bozarth et al., 2009) and when it is sufficiently narrow and 


unambiguous to the respondent (Wanous et al., 1997). 


Delivery and flexibility performance were each measured as 


two-item measures, using the measures validated by Liu et al. 


(2009) and McKone-Sweet and Lee (2009).

the development of a survey instrument that investigates the 


role of digital technologies on supply chain management 


practices. The supply chain module is one of three distinct
