Industry 4.0 is expected to impart profound changes to the configuration of manufacturing companies with
regards to what their value proposition will be and how their production network, supplier base and customer
interfaces will develop. The literature on the topic is still fragmented; the features of the emerging paradigm
appear to be a contested territory among different academic disciplines. This study assumes a value chain
perspective to analyze the evolutionary trajectories of manufacturing companies. We developed a Delphi-based
scenario analysis involving 76 experts from academia and practice. The results highlight the most common
expectations as well as controversial issues in terms of emerging business models, size, barriers to entry, vertical
integration, rent distribution, and geographical location of activities. Eight scenarios provide a concise outlook
on the range of possible futures. These scenarios are based on four main drivers which stem from the experts’
comments: demand characteristics, transparency of data among value chain participants, maturity of additive
manufacturing and advanced robotics, and penetration of smart products. Researchers can derive from our study
a series of hypotheses and opportunities for future research on Industry 4.0. Managers and policymakers can
leverage the scenarios in long-term strategic planning.


1. Introduction


The technological landscape is evolving rapidly around digitaliza-
tion, connectivity, and automation, fueling enthusiasm about a new
industrial revolution, also referred to as Industry 4.0 (Kagermann et al.,
2013; Hermann et al., 2016). Significant changes are expected in the
economic system as well as in the social sphere inducing a series of
research challenges (Mariani and Borghi, 2019; Caviggioli and
Ughetto, 2019). Central to this growing body of literature is the as-
sumption that Industry 4.0 has paradigmatic properties that make it
comparable to previous industrial revolutions (e.g., Steenhuis and
Pretorius, 2017; Li, 2018; Yin et al., 2018; Kim, 2018). The nature of
these properties is however still questioned against ongoing technolo-
gical uncertainties, early implementation examples, and late macro-
economic indicators (Brynjolfsson and McAfee, 2016; OECD, 2017).


In this paper we investigate the nature of the Industry 4.0 paradigm
with respect to the configuration of manufacturing companies. We
consider both the phenomenon's characteristics – i.e., “what practices
are enabled by Industry 4.0” – and its scope – i.e., “what kind of
companies will be affected”.


Despite the ever-growing research interest in Industry 4.0 and


related technologies, the overall picture is still incomplete and not
entirely coherent. Operations and Supply Chain Management research
has focused on the geographies and scale of production (e.g., Srai et al.,
2016; Ancarani et al., 2019). Strategy and Industrial Sociology scholars
have argued also that additive manufacturing technologies (AMTs) will
affect the competitive landscape with prospects of players’ consolida-
tion (D'Aveni, 2015; 2018) as opposed to manufacturing “democrati-
zation” (e.g., Birtchnell et al., 2017; Gress and Kalafski, 2015). The
Internet of Things (IoT) has mostly been investigated by research on
business model innovation. Closer relationships between manufacturers
and broad ecosystems of software developers, technology and service
providers have been posited (e.g., Rogers et al., 2016; Ehret and
Wirtz, 2017; Rymaszewska et al., 2017) together with increasing
commoditization of physical products and falling industry boundaries
(e.g., Porter and Heppelmann, 2014; 2015; Iansiti and Lakhani, 2014).
Supply chain management research has more recently focused on the
blockchain technology and its disintermediation effects (e.g., Chang
et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2019a).


Whereas some possible characteristics emerge from the literature, it
is still unclear whether they can be considered “paradigmatic”. This is
only partially motivated by the rapid transformative developments

characterizing Industry 4.0 today (Drath and Horch, 2014; Frank et al.,
2019a); other reasons lie the way the issue has been approached so far.
First, Industry 4.0 technologies have been mostly analyzed individually;
this focus – although beneficial for isolating initial hypotheses – does
not reflect their aggregate effects (e.g., Chiarello et al., 2018;
Mariani and Borghi, 2019; Culot et al., In Press). Second, the literature
has been developing within specific streams of research, largely ne-
glecting the long-debated interdependencies between competitive
strategy and operations configuration (e.g., Skinner, 1969; Hayes and
Wheelwright, 1984; Chen and Paulraj, 2004). Third – with few excep-
tions – impacts have been investigated from the perspective of the focal
company and its first-tier relations, whereas evolutionary phenomena
are characterized by the embeddedness of individual decisions and
outcomes in larger networks of business relations (e.g.,
Granovetter, 1985; Gulati et al., 2000; Choi et al., 2001; McFarland
et al., 2008; Pagani and Pardo, 2017).


The time has come for academia to question the scope of emerging
trajectories. As an ongoing revolution, Industry 4.0 is bound to re-
present a challenge to many existing theories; it is crucial today to
anticipate where the depth and breadth of changes require scholarly
research in order to draw attention to explaining the nature of the
configuration decisions made by manufacturing companies in this new
context. This is particularly relevant as – in front of extraordinary
technological opportunities – business leaders may risk making hasty
decisions overseeing long-term dynamics beyond single technology
applications and industry boundaries.


In this study we approach the issue with a broad focus in terms of
technology, configuration dimensions and analytical perspective,
starting from the concept of the value chain (VC). We believe that the
future of Industry 4.0 can be understood only by considering the var-
ious emerging technologies with respect to their impact on multi-tier
supplier-customer relations and parallel evolutions in adjacent in-
dustries – e.g., platform-based intermediaries, digital players entering
the manufacturing space and AMTs bringing in non-manufacturing
producers. VC analysis has often proved effective in the literature to
investigate recurring patterns and interdependencies in the configura-
tion of intra- and extra-industry players (Gereffi and Fernandez-
Stark, 2016; Hernández and Pedersen, 2017; Sartor et al., 2015;
Raikes et al., 2000).


Under this premise, the following research question is addressed:
RQ1: How will manufacturing VCs evolve in the context of Industry 4.0?
We developed an expert study structured as a Delphi-based scenario


analysis (Nowack et al., 2011; Bokrantz et al., 2017). This exploratory
research methodology was selected because of the interdisciplinarity
and complexity of the issue, which made the case for an involvement of
qualified academics and professionals able to provide an informed
opinion on current trends. The analysis was based on the principles of
interpretative research (Smith, 1983; Prasad and Prasad, 2002). As a
result, we provide a comprehensive overview of which configurations
are to be expected under the Industry 4.0 paradigm and raise questions
on some impacts that, although broadly discussed in the literature, were
perceived as controversial by the expert panel. The link between con-
textual drivers and future configurations is made explicit in eight sce-
narios.


This study contributes to the current debate on Industry 4.0 by
highlighting its most agreed-upon paradigmatic properties in the con-
figuration of manufacturing companies and by explicating a context-
specific typology. We also draw the attention of business leaders and
policy makers towards current uncertainties and far-reaching implica-
tions of Industry 4.0.


The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides the
literature background presenting the current knowledge about the


effects of Industry 4.0 and related technologies on manufacturing VCs.
Section 3 describes the research methodology. Section 4 presents the
statistics and content analysis of the Delphi study. In Section 5 we
discuss the main implications deriving from the Delphi study and for-
mulate the scenarios. We conclude in Section 6 by outlining the main
contributions and limitations of the study.


2. Literature background


This study fits into the growing debate on Industry 4.0 and related
technologies. The relevant literature is presented in three subsections.
In the first (Section 2.1) we elucidate the concept and provide an
overview of the main research issues. The literature more closely re-
lated to the scope of this study is then summarized in Section 2.2
(impacts of Industry 4.0 on manufacturing companies) and in
Section 2.3 (impacts of Industry 4.0 on other players involved in
manufacturing VCs). Finally, limitations of the literature and research
gaps are outlined in Section 2.4.


The papers presented in Sections 2.2 and 2.3 were identified
through a systematic approach. We performed a combined keyword
search on Scopus with two sets of keywords: the first was related to
Industry 4.0, similar concepts (e.g., “fourth industrial revolution”,
“smart manufacturing”, “digital transformation”) and underlying tech-
nological components (e.g., “Internet of Things”, “cloud computing”,
“artificial intelligence”, “additive manufacturing”, “blockchain”); the
second set of keywords included those related to the VC and other si-
milar analytical perspectives (e.g., “supply chain”, “ecosystem”, “in-
dustry”, “business model”) as well as specific configuration dimensions
(e.g., “shoring”, “sourcing”, “internalization”). 7115 journal articles
written in English were identified when the query was first submitted in
April 2019; abstracts and full texts were then examined. We considered
articles on Industry 4.0 as a whole as well as on single technologies;
impacts from a competitive and operations strategy point of view. The
search was complemented through a backward/forward approach –
following Webster and Watson's (2002) recommendations – and up-
dated until February 2020.


2.1. Industry 4.0: concept and research issues


Industry 4.0 is an overarching concept describing an ongoing in-
dustrial revolution triggered by a new wave of technological innovation
(Lasi et al., 2014; Liao et al., 2017; Ghombakhloo, 2018). The idea was
first expounded in the context of industrial policy when in 2011 Ger-
many introduced the initiative “Industrie 4.0”, which was aimed at
instilling new impetus to manufacturing through innovation-driven
collaboration among business, academia, and politics
(Kagermann et al., 2013; Reischauer, 2018). Today, Industry 4.0 ap-
pears to be an umbrella construct – as per Hirsch and Levin (1999) –
and is broadly used (to account) for various emerging technologies and
related practices in manufacturing and beyond (Oesterreich and
Teutemberg, 2016; Mariani and Borghi, 2019). “Digital transforma-
tion”, “smart manufacturing”, and the “fourth industrial revolution” are
other terms also commonly used to describe the phenomenon.


Several studies have attempted to define Industry 4.0 and related
terms (e.g., Nosalska et al., In Press; Fatorachian and Kazemi, 2018;
Xu, 2018); to clarify single technological paradigms such as the IoT
(e.g., Lu et al., 2018b), AMTs (e.g., Gardan, 2016) and the blockchain
technology (e.g., Pournader et al., 2020); and to conceptualize specific
underlying constructs such as the “smart factory” (e.g.,
Osterrieder et al., 2020) or the “digital supply chain” (e.g.,
Schniederjans et al., 2020; Garay-Rondero et al., 2020). Overall, how-
ever, there is still no agreed-upon definition either of the phenomenon


G. Culot, et al.










or of its constituent elements.
Industry 4.0 is commonly understood as a broad socio-technical


paradigm (Dalenogare et al., 2018; Mariani and Borghi, 2019). In its
original German conceptualization (Kagermann et al., 2013) the scope
of the phenomenon was limited to manufacturing, but the distinction
became less sharp in the light of technology-driven transformations
across economic sectors (e.g., Simchi-Levi and Wu, 2018; Caro and
Sadr, 2019; Mariani et al., 2018) as well as in the public and social
sphere (e.g., Nicolescu et al., 2018; Ossewaarde, 2019; Pauget and
Dammak, 2019).


The technologies underpinning the phenomenon are various –
Chiarello et al. (2018) identified more than 1,000 individual technol-
ogies referring to 30 different disciplinary fields – and the landscape is
still evolving through convergence and mutual combination (Yoo et al.,
2012; OECD, 2017). Some classifications of the main enabling tech-
nologies have been put forward in the literature (e.g.,
Ghombakhloo, 2018; Pereira and Romero, 2017; Frank et al., 2019a;
Culot et al., In Press). Overall, the technologies most mentioned are the
Internet of Things, cyber-physical systems, cloud computing, big data
analytics, vertical and horizontal system integration, additive manu-
facturing, simulation, augmented reality, advanced robotics, aug-
mented reality, and – most recently – the blockchain technology. New
materials – e.g., “smart”, nano-, bio-based materials – and energy sto-
rage solutions have also been cited, although less frequently (e.g.,
OECD, 2017; Kusiak, 2018). Specific applications of these technologies
might further automate internal production and business processes,
provide support and assist the workforce, facilitate interactions with
clients and customers along the supply chain, and be used for “smart
products” (Frank et al., 2019a).


The Industry 4.0 phenomenon at large and individual key enabling
technologies have been at the center of a growing interest across
managerial disciplines; detailed overviews can be found in recent lit-
erature reviews and bibliometric analyses (e.g., Strozzi et al., 2017;
Gagliati and Bigliardi, 2019; Mariani and Borghi, 2019; Wagire et al.,
2020; Mahlmann Kipper et al., In Press). Overall, four broad research
foci are at the core of the ongoing debate: implementation process
characteristics, emerging adoption patterns, possible impacts, and non-
technological features of the phenomenon.


As regards the first – i.e., implementation process characteristics –
the literature has explored drivers and barriers (e.g., Chatzoglou and
Michailidou, 2019; Yeh and Chen, 2018; Ghombakhloo, In Press); in-
itial disadvantages of small and medium enterprises (e.g., Horváth and
Szabó, 2019; Moeuf et al., 2020; Arcidiacono et al., 2019) and devel-
oping countries (e.g., Kamble et al., 2018; Raj et al., 2020); best-prac-
tice implementation processes (e.g., Mellor et al., 2014; Svan et al.,
2017; Zangiacomi et al., 2020; Tortorella et al., 2020; Veile et al.,
2020); ideal maturity stages (e.g., Bibby and Dehe, 2018;
Pacchini et al., 2019); and governance modes in specific geographical
and institutional contexts (e.g., Reynolds and Yilmaz, 2018;
Sung, 2018; Kummitha and Crutzen, 2019; Fukuda, 2020).


The second focus – i.e., emerging adoption patterns – revolves
around the current situation and possible typologies of Industry 4.0
technologies. This topic has been explored with firm-level surveys (e.g.,
Akhtar et al., 2018; Dalenogare et al., 2018; Frank et al., 2019a;
Ferreira et al., 2019; Chiarini et al., In Press) as well as secondary data
analysis (Ancarani et al., 2020; Castelo-Branco et al., 2019), expert
studies (Lu and Weng, 2018a, 2018b) and case research
(Calabrese et al., 2020). Several articles have also investigated con-
sumers’ adoption and attitudes towards smart products and AMTs (e.g.,
Caputo et al., 2018; Mittal et al., 2018; Halassi et al., 2019;
Baudier et al., 2020).


The third broad topic refers to the possible impacts of the


phenomenon. Research has been tackling the effects of one or more
technologies on single performance metrics (e.g., Kunovjanek and
Reiner, 2020), operational performance expectations (e.g., Frank et al.,
2019a; Büchi et al., 2020), stock market returns (Lam et al., 2019), and
overall firm competitiveness (e.g., Niaki and Nonino, 2017). Scholars
have also warned against unintended social consequences of the phe-
nomenon (e.g., Kaplan and Haenlein, 2020; Kovacs, 2018;
Ossewaarde, 2019), with empirical investigations mainly related to job
market impacts (e.g., Dengler and Matthes, 2018; Balsmeier and
Woerter, 2019).


The last overarching research issue concerns – under the assumption
of Industry 4.0 as a socio-technical paradigm – the non-technological
features of the phenomenon. Academics have delved into the profile
and skills of human resources (e.g., Jarrahi, 2019; Liboni et al., In Press;
Wright and Schultz, 2018; Candi and Beltangui, 2019); organizational
design and processes (e.g., Falkenreck and Wagner, 2017;
Osmonbekov and Johnson, 2016); organizational capabilities, culture,
and mindset (e.g., Hasselblatt et al., 2018; Matthyssens, 2019; Frisk and
Bannister, 2017); and entrepreneurial processes and outcomes (e.g.,
Nambisan, 2017; Nambisan et al., 2018; Elia et al., 2020). Several
studies have also argued for a strong relationship between Industry 4.0
and lean manufacturing (e.g., Totorella and Fettermann, 2017;
Pagliosa et al., 2019; Rosin et al., 2020) as well as with circular
economy practices (e.g., Lopes de Sousa Jabbour et al., 2018;
Rosa et al. 2020; Kouhizadeh et al., 2020). Within this last broad focus,
emerging configuration trajectories of manufacturing companies have
also been addressed, as illustrated in larger detail in the following two
subsections.


2.2. Industry 4.0: impacts on manufacturing companies


Academic research has started to approach the impact of new
technologies on manufacturing configuration; an overview of the most
relevant literature is presented in Table 1.


The literature is characterized by a fragmentation of research in-
terest and single technology focus. Few studies have addressed the
whole set of Industry 4.0 technologies so far, and only focus on specific
impacts, e.g., the reshoring phenomenon. From a methodological per-
spective, conceptual studies and case research are prevalent. Several
articles have investigated the manufacturing sector as a whole; others
refer only to specific industries, in particular Automotive and
Machinery and Equipment, while few papers have considered the
evolutionary trajectories that are taking place in both manufacturing
and services.


Overall, it is possible to derive a series of emerging impacts of
Industry 4.0 on the configuration of manufacturing in relation to: (1)
new value offering, (2) location decisions, (3) governance of activities,
and (4) size of manufacturing companies.


Change in the (1) value offering of manufacturing companies has
been mainly addressed within research on technology-driven business
models. Academics have been focusing on three main trends: the first is
related to increasing mass-customization (Bogers et al., 2016), the
second to higher sustainability (Nascimento et al., 2019), the third to a
progressive dematerialization from physical products to digital designs
(e.g., D'Aveni, 2015; Jiang et al., 2017) and services (e.g., Ehret and
Wirtz, 2017; Ardolino et al., 2018; Frank et al., 2019b). The literature
has been developing in two concurrent streams, one with a focus on
IoT-driven digital services and non-ownership models (e.g., Porter and
Heppelmann, 2014; Rymaszewska et al., 2017; Boehmer et al., 2020),
the other on AMTs’ potential for new forms of production. These refer
to digital platforms simplifying access to manufacturing capabilities
(e.g., Rogers et al., 2016; Ryan et al., 2017), on-site printing by retailers

and logistics operators (e.g., Jia et al., 2016; Durach et al., 2017) and
private 3D printers installed in homes or community centers (e.g.,
Birtchnell and Urry, 2013; Halassi et al., 2019).


The impact of technology on (2) location decisions has likewise
been at the center of significant academic debate. Several studies have
suggested a relationship between Industry 4.0 and reshoring – i.e., the
decision to bring those production activities back home or to neigh-
bouring countries, which had previously been offshored due to lower
labor intensity and higher digital maturity in developed countries
(Morandlou and Tate, 2018; Barbieri et al., 2017). These hypotheses
have found initial empirical confirmation in Fratocchi (2018),
Ancarani et al. (2019), Dachs et al. (2019) and Stentoft and
Rajkumar (2020). The increasing applicability of AMTs has imparted
new impetus to research on redistributed manufacturing – i.e., a model
of localized production involving many small or micro-scale manu-
facturing facilities (e.g. Rauch et al., 2017; Hannibal and Knight, 2018).
The model is currently being piloted in specific segments, such as 3D-
printed spare parts (e.g., Chekurov et al., 2018).


The issue of (3) governance has attracted lower academic interest so
far. Reported trends point in the direction of direct sales, disin-
termediation of service networks, and increasing internalization of
technology and data-related activities (Pagani and Pardo, 2017;
Subramanian et al., 2019; Rymaszewska et al., 2017). The impact on
production activities, on the other hand, is not clear. Outsourcing might
increase because of easier digital coordination with suppliers
(Strange and Zucchella, 2017), the need to access specialized cap-
abilities for customization purposes (Gress and Kalafski, 2015;
LaPlume et al., 2016), and digital platforms providing ready access to
manufacturing capabilities (Berman, 2012; Rehnberg and Ponte, 2018).
These expectations, however, have been supported only by limited
empirical evidence so far and more internalization of production has
also been observed (Fratocchi, 2018; Rayna and Striukova, 2016;
Kohtamäki et al., 2019).


The effects of Industry 4.0 on the (4) size of manufacturing firms are
equally unclear. Whereas product innovation is triggering the entrance
of new players across several manufacturing industries, in the future a
higher concentration is to be expected due to technological standardi-
zation (Yun et al., 2016). Different speculations have been made as
regards to production activities. On the one hand, consolidation trends
seem to be supported by the need to guarantee higher service levels
because of mass customization, by AMTs cutting out component sup-
pliers and contract manufacturers and also by the pursuit of cost sy-
nergies in the light of the increasing price transparency of online sales
channels (Tziantopoulos et al., 2019; Rehnberg and Ponte, 2018;
Holmström et al., 2016). On the other hand, it has been argued that
AMTs and digital coordination technologies will provide more oppor-
tunities to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to network with large
players for mass customization, spare parts and localized production
(Braziotis et al., 2019; Gress and Kalafski, 2015).


Along these dimensions, several studies have suggested industry-
specific variations because of different levels of technological applic-
ability (e.g., LaPlume et al., 2016; Athanasoupoulou et al., 2019),
standards and regulation requirements (e.g., Weller et al., 2015;
Hannibal and Knight, 2018; Braziotis et al., 2019), as well as current
industry characteristics and inertia to change (e.g., Bertola and
Teunissen, 2018; Kapetaniou et al., 2018; Sun and Zhao, 2017).


2.3. Industry 4.0: impacts on other players involved in manufacturing VCs


As shown in Table 1, several papers have investigated emerging
configurations of manufacturing companies within their broader net-
works of business relations. Research has mostly focused on focal firms’


first-tier interfaces, e.g., investigating how companies shape their
business models, orchestrate resources within their ecosystem or re-
design their supply chains. Few studies – mainly conceptual (e.g.,
Porter and Heppelman, 2014; LaPlume et al., 2016; Sun and
Zhao, 2017) – have approached the issue considering whole industries
or VCs. These are mostly from a geographical point of view; very few
contributions have considered the interplay between the economic and
societal level.


From this literature it is possible to identify some evolutionary dy-
namics:


(1) an increasing dependency from suppliers of IoT technologies
and data providers, as well as the emergence of broad networks
of collaborative partners in software development and product
design supported by modularization and platform-based gov-
ernance (e.g., Iansiti and Lahkani, 2014; Kiel et al., 2017;
Rong et al., 2015; Cenamor et al., 2017);


(2) final customers turning into prosumers that co-create products
and services with companies through the Internet and 3D print
directly at home (e.g., Wang et al., 2016; Hamalainen and
Karjalainen, 2017; Halassi et al., 2019);


(3) traditional intermediaries in both the consumer and business
segment being challenged by the spread of digital platforms
(e.g., Durach et al., 2017; Jiang et al., 2017; Halassi et al.,
2019), blockchain technologies automating several “middle-
man” activities (e.g., Cole et al., 2019; Chang et al., 2019;
Morkunas et al., 2019), smart cities becoming increasingly re-
levant (e.g., Kumar et al., 2016);


(4) competitors from adjacent sectors, digital players, and tech-
nology providers operating in broader cross-industry market
ecosystems (e.g., Culot et al., 2019, Frank et al., 2019b;
Hakanen and Rajala, 2016); and


(5) overall deep changes in the relational dynamics and configura-
tion drivers that determine opportunities and constraints for
individual companies along manufacturing VCs. These refer to:
changes in the economies of scale and scope in production (e.g.,
Bogers et al., 2016); a shift in the sources of competitive ad-
vantage and new barriers to entry in relation to control over
data and proprietary technologies (e.g., Porter and
Heppelman, 2014; Weller et al., 2015; Vendrell-Herrero et al.,
2017); a redistribution of value towards services and data-re-
lated activities or rather towards production (e.g., Durach et al.,
2017; Jia et al., 2016; Rehnberg and Ponte, 2018).


In order to provide a comprehensive overview of the configuration
trajectories affecting manufacturing VCs, three further streams of lit-
erature should also be mentioned. The first one is related to the growing
academic interest around technological platforms. The current debate
on Industry 4.0 in manufacturing has only partially been influenced by
the “economic perspective” of platform research so far (Gawer, 2014;
McIntyre and Srinivisan, 2017), the main focus being on manufacturers
sponsoring technological platforms to engage with third-party com-
plementors. The increasing prevalence of platform-based approaches
raises, however, further questions concerning demand dynamics (e.g.,
Bryonlfsson et al., 2010), cross-industry consolidation trends (e.g.,
Eisenmann et al., 2011; Ruutu et al., 2017) as well as potential direct
competition between platforms and manufacturers (e.g., Zhu and
Liu, 2018). The second stream of research is related to data manage-
ment for value creation in the era of big data (e.g., Davenport, 2017;
Iansiti and Lahkani, 2020; Hagiu and Wright, 2020; Spiekermann and
Korunustovska, 2017). In these studies, attention has been placed on
understanding how different types of data represent a source of


G. Culot, et al.






competitive advantage, an issue that has been tackled only marginally
in the research investigating IoT-enabled business models in manu-
facturing. The third and last stream is also related to the data issue,
where some studies have also investigated emerging business models
and concentration dynamics of technology providers in the IoT
(Metallo et al., 2018; Basaure et al., 2020) and in the big data industries
(e.g., Urbinati et al., 2019; Nuccio and Guerzoni, 2019).


2.4. Summary and research gaps


A key question within the growing literature on Industry 4.0 is re-
lated to its non-technological features under the assumption of a new
socio-technical paradigm. Within this broad research focus, the con-
figuration of manufacturing companies has been addressed from a
competitive and an operations strategy perspective. Various meth-
odologies have been employed aiming, on the one hand, at under-
standing how companies are currently shaping their approaches and, on
the other, at deriving future general trends. Some characteristics have
been highlighted in terms of manufacturing companies’ value offering,
location, governance and size; many questions do, however, remain on
the specific implications. Several studies have also addressed possible
impacts within the manufacturing companies’ network of business re-
lations, even though they mostly consider focal companies’ first-tier
interfaces. Potential changes refer to suppliers and partners, customers,
intermediaries, competitors and relational dynamics across the various
players along manufacturing VCs.


Overall, the current understanding of the paradigmatic properties of
Industry 4.0 is still unclear and – to a certain extent – ambivalent. Part
of the issue is related to the fact that, today, researchers are clearly
confronted with mostly exemplary cases of large-scale technology im-
plementation (e.g., Hofmann and Rüsch, 2017; OECD, 2017;
World Economic Forum, 2019) and business model innovation
(Bughin and van Zeebroeck, 2017; Weking et al., 2020). Academics
investigating how companies – usually the most advanced ones – are
configuring for Industry 4.0 have identified emerging trajectories and
provided managers with insights on actual opportunities, but inevitably
failed to describe the nature of the new paradigm and thus to make
explicit the range of options and implications. Moreover, business
models, ecosystems and supply chains analyzed from the point of view
of focal firms did not consider the implications of parallel transforma-
tive evolutions in upstream and downstream manufacturing industries
as well as in adjacent sectors. Although some scholars have approached
the issue with broader analytical scope and greater future orientation
(e.g., Jiang et al., 2017; Opresnik and Taisch, 2015; Hannibal and
Knight, 2018), there still remain significant knowledge gaps. The main
gap is probably related to the narrow focus of these studies: it is still not
possible to fully grasp cross technological effects and the inter-
dependencies between competitive and operations strategy (e.g.,
Skinner, 1969; Hayes and Wheelwright, 1984; Chen and Paluraj, 2004)
as technologies and specific impacts have been examined separately so
far.


In conclusion, even if some possible configuration trajectories
emerge from the literature, there is still confusion around the big-pic-
ture. As Industry 4.0 is still in its early stages, we believe that a
worthwhile academic endeavor is to initiate a broader debate that –
starting from the learnings of previous research on specific technolo-
gical and thematic issues – could anticipate the most crucial challenges
in the configuration of manufacturing companies in the long term.


3. Research methodology


Under the assumption that – similar to previous industrial revolu-
tions – Industry 4.0 will result in a paradigm shift in the configuration
of manufacturing companies, we approached the current knowledge


gap through a future-oriented and interdisciplinary research. Drawing
from a recent literature review on the definition of Industry 4.0 and
similar concepts (Culot et al., 2020), four main clusters of technologies
were considered: physical/digital interface technologies bridging the
cyber-space with the reality of machines, products, and people at work
(i.e., the IoT, cyber-physical systems, and visualization technologies);
network technologies providing online functionalities (i.e., cloud
computing, interoperability and cybersecurity solutions, and the
blockchain technology); data-processing technologies supporting analysis
and providing information-driven input for decision making (i.e., si-
mulation, machine learning and artificial intelligence, big data analy-
tics); and physical-digital process technologies (i.e., AMTs, advanced ro-
botics, new materials and energy management solutions). We assumed
that our analysis should be stretched beyond individual companies’
boundaries and dyadic relationships. As system-level construct, the VC
seemed the most apt as it includes both manufacturing and non-man-
ufacturing players, encompasses different stages along the value crea-
tion process, and allows for syncretic analyses.


In line with a well-established tradition across managerial dis-
ciplines (Meredith et al., 1989; Ramirez et al., 2015), we developed an
expert study approached through the lenses of interpretative research
(Smith, 1983; Prasad and Prasad, 2002). The underlying assumption
was that:


• qualified academics and professionals with heterogenous back-
grounds were in a position to provide an informed opinion on the
issue in its different facets;
• a structured collection and analysis of these opinions could inform
the formulation of hypotheses on the future of Industry 4.0;
• these hypotheses would not provide a definitive forecast as the eli-
citation of expert opinion is necessarily contextualized and bounded
by available information;
• through the adoption of interpretative research as epistemological
stance – i.e., through the analysis of how the future is construed and
conceptualized – we could highlight the most crucial uncertainties.


Under this premise the study was structured as a Delphi-based
scenario analysis. This methodology enables the formulation of a series
of scenarios – i.e., “descriptions of possible futures that reflect different
perspectives” (van Notten et al., 2003, p. 424) – starting from the col-
lective understanding of a panel of experts engaged in multiple-round
questionnaires. This approach has been deployed consistently since the
1990s to enhance the objectivity of scenario planning (Nowack et al.,
2011; Saritas and Oner, 2004). Compared with other expert opinion
elicitation methodologies, the Delphi technique minimizes the social
difficulties related to status or personality traits in interacting groups
while fostering social learning (Rowe et al., 1991). First, experts re-
spond individually to a questionnaire, then the aggregated results are
fed back to the group allowing participants to revise their original an-
swers and provide further comments (Linstone and Turoff, 1975). The
process was reiterated until the group has reached either consensus or
stability in the results (von der Gracht, 2012; Linstone, 1978).


Following Nowack et al. (2011) methodological recommendations
and the example of similar works (e.g., Bokrantz et al., 2017;
Jiang et al., 2017; Roßmann et al., 2018; Durach et al., 2017; von der
Gracht and Darkow, 2010), we engaged the experts in the assessment of
a set of projections – i.e., short future theses – defined beforehand by
the research team through a structured process. The reference year for
the assessment was set to be 2030, consistently with the typical 10-15
years forecasting horizon of similar studies.


The experts were divided into three industry subpanels to account
for the industry-specific dynamics highlighted in the literature (e.g.,
LaPlume et al., 2016; Ferràz-Hernández et al., 2017; Braziotis et al.,
2019). The first criterion was technological intensity, measured as


G. Culot, et al.






direct research and development (R&D) intensity and R&D embodied in
intermediate and investments goods (Galindo-Rueda and Verger, 2016).
The second criterion was the end-use category. The two criteria were
combined to select industries with diverse characteristics leveraging on
the classification of economic activities developed by the Organization
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). We included
Apparel and Footwear (low technological intensity – non-durable con-
sumer goods), Automotive (medium-high technological intensity –
durable consumer/capital goods), and Machinery and Equipment
(medium-high technological intensity – capital goods).


The research process and timeline are illustrated in Fig. 1. The four
main phases are described in detail in the following paragraphs. The
study was conducted with the collaboration of BCG.


3.1. Conceptual model and development of projections


Our first step was to develop a conceptual model of the VC (Fig. 2)
that would enable the analysis – across multiple dimensions – of re-
curring patterns in the configuration of the various players involved in
the full range of activities needed to bring a product from its conception
to its final use (Gereffi and Fernandez-Stark, 2016; Raikes et al., 2000).
Building on the ideas and terminology of various schools of thought,
our conceptual model is structured on three levels of analysis.


The first level refers to VC boundaries (1) that define the scope of the
analysis. We leveraged on the concept of “extended value chain”
(Kaplinsky, 2000; Kaplinsky and Morris, 2000) to include new suppliers
and partners (1A) and borrowed from industry structure analysis (e.g.,
Porter, 1979; Bell, 1981; Scherer and Ross, 1990; Sampler, 1998) the


Fig. 1. Research process.


Fig. 2. Conceptual model.

idea of “industry boundaries” to investigate the evolution of markets
and competitive arenas (1B).


Once the boundaries are defined, the conceptual model breaks down
the VC into its building blocks, or single activities (2). The single activ-
ities vary by industry and are normally identified through the analysis
of a VC input-output structure as individual firms are producers/users
of inputs to/from other firms (Hopkins and Wallerstein, 1994). Activ-
ities typically included are research and development, raw material and
technology supply, upstream and downstream manufacturing, dis-
tribution, marketing and sales. In line with well-established concepts in
the study of supply chains (e.g., Hayes and Wheelwright, 1984;
Lambert et al., 1998; Choi et al., 2001; Carter et al., 2005), we con-
sidered both physical and support activities. The two inner boxes in the
conceptual model specifically differentiate activities related to value
transformation – i.e., the production of physical goods and related ser-
vices – from those involving value intermediation – i.e., the transfer of
value between different stages of the VC and ultimately to the con-
sumer. At this level of analysis, we adopted the typical lenses of in-
dustrial organization (IO) economy as it developed from its early days
(e.g., Mason, 1939; Bain, 1956). We considered business models and
new entrants (2A), the level of concentration (2B), and the barriers to
entry (2C). Moreover, because reshoring and redistributed manu-
facturing emerged as key topics in the literature, we also included the
geographical location (2D) of activities as a topic for investigation.


The third level of analysis considers cross-activity (3) dynamics and
examines the way in which single activities are linked together by VC
participants. The reasoning is grounded again in the IO economics
tradition, as well as in the concepts of global commodity chains (GCCs),
global value chains (GVCs) and global production networks (GPNs),
concepts that originated to explain the geographies and governance of
activities in the context of the globalization phenomenon (e.g.,
Raikes et al., 2000; Gereffi et al., 2005; Coe et al., 2008; Gibbon et al.,
2009; Hernández and Pedersen, 2017). At this level of analysis, we took
into account governance modes on a market-hierarchy continuum (3A),
rent distribution (3B) and the degree of geographical dispersion (3C).


The set of projections was developed on the basis of the available
knowledge on the topic. As suggested by von der Gracht and
Darkow (2010) and Bokrantz et al. (2017), we resorted to multiple
sources for collecting inputs:


(1) a literature review of academic studies (Table 1) investigating the
impact of Industry 4.0 and related technologies on manufacturing
VC;


(2) a literature review of non-academic sources, including white papers
published by management consulting firms, multinational compa-
nies, governmental bodies, and other international organizations;


(3) a workshop with four academics and two BCG consultants experi-
enced in Industry 4.0. The workshop was structured as an initial
brainstorming session on the conceptual model (Fig. 2), comments
were transcribed;


(4) a thematic industry round table with eight senior professionals
actively involved in Industry 4.0 implementation. The panel in-
cluded three technology providers and five industry executives;
three out of the five were also involved in thematic initiatives
promoted by industry associations and government agencies.
Participants were asked to share their experience and views on the
topic and their comments were transcribed.


The data from these four sources were thoroughly analyzed.
Following well-established practices in qualitative research
(Mayring, 2008; Seuring and Gold, 2012; Miles, Huberman and


Saldana, 2014), both the literature and the transcripts were coded de-
ductively. The coding categories were determined according to the
conceptual model illustrated in Fig. 2. Two researchers were involved
independently in the process, any disagreement was discussed within
the team until agreement was reached.


The coding activity resulted in an initial list of 97 possible impacts.
As the quality of Delphi studies is affected by the effort and time re-
quired for compiling the questionnaire (Linstone and Turoff, 1975;
Landeta, 2006; Rowe et al., 1991), this initial list of possible impacts
was significantly rationalized. Redundancies were ruled out and similar
themes across different analytical dimensions were combined following
the Jiang et al. (2017) example.


The final list included 43 projections phrased in English according
to established practices for the length and number of elements in each
sentence (Mitchell, 1991), the definition of technological concepts
(Johnson, 1976) and the avoidance of ambiguity and conditional
statements (Rowe and Wright, 2011; Loveridge, 2002). Two external
researchers and three consultants independently analyzed the full list of
projections for content and face validity (Salancik et al., 1971).


The final list of 43 projections is presented in Table 2. The projec-
tions are clustered according to the level of analysis and the main topics
of the conceptual model in Fig. 1. The final questionnaire is based on
the same structure.


3.2. Selection of the expert panel


A rigorous selection of the experts is a precondition for the relia-
bility of a Delphi study (Hasson and Keeney, 2011; Landeta, 2006).
Previous research shows significant differences in the number of experts
involved – with studies featuring from 10 to 20 participants (e.g.,
McCarthy and Atthirawong, 2003) up to several hundred (e.g., Fundin
et al., 2018) – and also in their heterogeneity in terms of professional
background, age, gender, and nationality (Loo, 2002; Yaniv, 2011).
These differences are mostly explained by the topic and the aims of
each study.


In line with the explorative nature of our research and the cross-
disciplinary nature of the debate, we opted for a panel size of at least 60
experts – minimum of 20 for each industry subpanel – with hetero-
geneous professional backgrounds. Heterogeneity was pursued in terms
of academia/practice and – within each group – discipline/function,
consideration of operations and supply chain management as well as
strategy, marketing, and general management. Selection criteria were
built to ensure that experts were knowledgeable and had global visi-
bility on the phenomenon.


Consistent with previous studies, academics were identified on the
basis of the publications in the domain by means of scientific databases
(e.g., Scopus) and personal networking. Professionals were selected
taking into account individuals with at least manager-level responsi-
bility in the industries in scope or their employment with digital
players, technology providers, digital advisory boutiques as well as
management consultants. They were scouted searching the alumni di-
rectories of the academic institutions involved in the study, professional
social networks (such as LinkedIn) as well as the global industrial
practice network, the alumni database and the client base of BCG.
Industry executives were first selected in the above-mentioned data-
bases through a keyword search on their current industry of employ-
ment, thereafter each profile was carefully examined. This approach led
to an initial list of 303 individuals, 77 of whom agreed to take part in
the Delphi study. In order to further ensure rigor in the selection pro-
cess (Landeta, 2006), the questionnaire included three self-rating
questions on the perceived level of knowledgeability, i.e., familiarity

G. Culot, et al.






and professional experiences. Overall, the study features strong parti-
cipation of practitioners, including executives from some of the most
renowned firms within each industry and managers from leading digital
companies (e.g., Amazon, Google, IBM, Cisco); however, the panel is
skewed towards industry incumbents as it features a low number of
digital consultants and entrepreneurs. Years of experience – 58 out of
76 respondents (76%) have more than 10 years of professional ex-
perience – and self-rated familiarity with the topics of the study further
confirm the level of expertise of the panel. In terms of gender, the
Apparel and Footwear subpanel is well balanced, whereas the other two
are mainly composed of male respondents. From a geographical per-
spective, the main manufacturing countries in Europe – Germany and
Italy – and the United States are well represented; however, other re-
levant manufacturing economies in Asia – China, India, and Japan –
have only a limited number of respondents.


3.3. Evaluation and analysis


The questionnaire was developed starting from the list of 43 pro-
jections (Table 2) previously formulated (Section 3.1). Both the first-
and the second-round questionnaires were pretested with five external
academics and practitioners following standard methodological prac-
tices (Blair, Czaja and Blair, 2013; Forza, 2002).


The experts were asked to evaluate the projections based on how
well they were providing a correct description of the present situation
(“Magnitude in 2019”) and of the future in 2030 (“Magnitude in
2030”). The assessments were performed on an ordinal five-point
Likert-type scale (1: Very low, 5: Very high). The experts were also
invited to provide a rationale for their evaluation in an open textbox;
1218 comments were collected in the first round and a further 313 in
the second, attesting to the high commitment of the participants.


The first round lasted five weeks, starting at the end of January
2019. An interim analysis was performed and thereafter separately for
each industry subpanel. In line with the nature of the data, the median
as a measure of central tendency and the interquartile range (IQR) for
answer dispersion were calculated for all the Likert items; items with
IQR≤1 were considered to have reached consensus in the expert eva-
luation (von der Gracht, 2012; Schmidt, 1997). The qualitative data
were approached through a content analysis resulting in a list of ar-
guments supporting high and low future magnitude for each projection
(Miles et al., 2014).


Starting with the results of the interim analysis we developed the
second-round questionnaire. Each expert received a form including –
for each projection – the statistics, arguments, and his/her original
assessment from the first round. The participants were asked to confirm
or revise their original answers in view of this information. The second
round lasted six weeks starting in mid-April 2019. The analysis was
approached consistently with the first round. The results of the first and
the second round were compared and analyzed in terms of stability –
i.e., “the consistency of responses between successive rounds of a study”
(Dajani et al., 1979, p. 84) – calculating the Spearman's rank-order
correlation coefficient (ρ) (von der Gracht, 2012; DeLeo, 2004). After
the second round, the assessments of all Likert-type items reached ei-
ther consensus (IQR ≤ 1) or stability (ρ≥0.75) in each subpanel, thus
making further iterations of the questionnaire with the experts super-
fluous.


3.4. Scenario development


The results of the Delphi study served as a basis to elaborate on
eight scenarios for manufacturing VCs in 2030. We first identified the
four most recurring elements of uncertainty in the expert comments.
The impact of different future states of these elements of uncertainty


(e.g., “high” or “low” future states) on the affected projections were
then analyzed. The projections served as a basis to formulate consistent
scenarios, following a plausibility and internal consistency analysis
(Lehr et al., 2017; Johansen, 2018). This approach is in line with the
backwards logic method in scenario planning as the driving forces are
inferred from future states (Derbyshire and Wright, 2014; Wright and
Cairns, 2011; Wright and Goodwin, 2009).


The results were shared with the 76 experts involved in the study,
who received the full article draft together with a 6-minute video il-
lustrating the main messages of the paper. The experts were encouraged
to share their comments with the research team, the feedback con-
firmed that the research was able to adequately capture the initial
opinions of the experts and the debate developed thorughout the Delphi
study.


4. Results


This section presents the results of the Delphi study. First, we out-
line the descriptive statistics for the two rounds (Section 4.1), thereafter
we illustrate the content analysis of the experts’ comments and present
a conclusive narrative for each projection in 2030 (Section 4.2).


4.1. Delphi statistics


The analysis of the Likert items is presented in Table 4. The median
values of “Magnitude in 2019” and “Magnitude in 2030” were calcu-
lated for the two rounds whereby the three industry subpanels were
considered separately; the values in brackets indicate items with low
subpanel consensus (IQR≤1). In order to provide a synthetic overview,
the table also includes the median values calculated for the whole panel
in the second round (“Total”). In addition the IQR for the second round
and the stability between rounds (Spearman's ρ) is presented.


All projections except for two (#6 and #35) have a median
“Magnitude in 2030” of 3 or higher in at least one industry subpanel,
confirming the relevance of the issues identified through the research
process (Section 3.1). The results show an increasing convergence of
opinions through the iteration of the questionnaire. After the first
round, out of 86 items (43 projections in two points in time, “Magni-
tude in 2019” and “Magnitude in 2030”), 46 reached consensus for
Apparel and Footwear (53%), 35 for Automotive (41%) and 44 for
Machinery and Equipment (51%). After the second round, the items
reaching consensus were respectively 60 (70%), 70 (81%) and 76
(88%). These values indicate the effectiveness of the social learning
process and are in line with previous studies (Bokrantz et al., 2017). As
expected, the “Magnitude in 2019” items display a higher level of
agreement than the “Magnitude in 2030” ones in both rounds.


A comparison of the results of the three subpanels reveals several
industry specificities. The median values differ across subpanels for 56
out of 86 items (65%); for 46 items (53%) consensus was reached in all
subpanels. The analysis of the Spearman's ρ highlights relatively more
stability in the Machinery and Equipment subpanel.


4.2. Content analysis and conclusive narratives


The following sections present the results of the content analysis of
the experts’ comments collected over the two rounds. For each pro-
jection, the tables include:


• the median values in the second round of “Magnitude in 2019” and
“Magnitude in 2030” for the whole expert panel (Table 4, column
“Total”);
• arguments for high and low magnitude and industry-specific ele-
ments emerging from the content analysis of the experts’ comments.


G. Culot, et al.






• a conclusive narrative presenting the forecast for 2030.
The results are presented according to the three levels of analysis


included in the conceptual framework underpinning our study (Fig. 2).


4.2.1. Boundaries
The projections related to the first level of analysis – the redefinition


of the boundaries of manufacturing VCs – are presented in Table 5.
In terms of Suppliers and partners (1A), the Delphi study confirms the


increasing relevance of AMTs in future VCs (Projection #1). AMTs will
be broadly applied for customization purposes (Comment #1b),

although with different penetration due to process/product character-
istics. Suppliers of data will also grow in importance (#2) as data be-
comes a crucial factor of production in both marketing and supply chain
operations (#2a) and regulation clarifies open issues (#2d/e). Rare
natural resources (#3) are presumed to be a major concern mostly in
the Automotive industry because of batteries for electric vehicles (#3e).
The relevance of players in waste management services (#4) is also
expected to grow, although with possible differences across geographies
(#4d/e).


As far as Markets and customers (1B) are concerned, the results in-
dicate strong expectations towards future cross-industry ecosystems
(#5) driven by the increasing prevalence of smart products (#5a/e) and
by companies broadening their offering to extract more value from the
same customer group (#5d). As for the mobility ecosystem in specific,
the experts have raised doubts concerning consumers’ buy-in and in-
dustry incumbents’ retaliation strategies (#5g/h). New forms of home
fabrication (#6) are instead anticipated to have marginal relevance
besides recreational use or market niches (#6c/d). Finally, the sale of
data to third parties appeared as a clear trend (#7) although it is pre-
sumed that companies will still prefer to internally retain data con-
sidered a potential source of competitive advantage (#7f).


4.2.2. Single activities
Table 6 shows the analysis and the conclusive narratives for the


second level of analysis, i.e., single activities along the VC. All the
projections concerning Business models and new entrants (2A) were
judged as increasingly relevant. The respondents were moderately po-
sitive towards micro-factories serving multiple clients (#8), a model
that – supported by new production and digital coordination


technologies (#8a/e) – could be more effective for flexibility and cus-
tomization purposes (#8b/h). The same arguments support the pro-
spect of a slight increase in virtual manufacturing approaches (#11) –
i.e., the full outsourcing of production activities – despite possible
limitations for complex products (#11m). Business models based on
digital services substituting traditional offerings (#9) are foreseen as
one of the key features of future manufacturing VCs and seem sup-
ported by the spread of smart products, non-ownership approaches, and
the digitalization of business services (#9a/b/d/h). A similar substitu-
tion effect is envisaged for product innovation and new materials
driving the entrance of new players (#10).


As regards new intermediaries, despite growing concerns over the
control of customer data (#12f/g), the study confirms the trend towards
platform-based business models in consumer sales, smart product ap-
plications, and business services (#12b/c/d). The applicability of cloud
manufacturing platforms – i.e., platforms intermediating the access to
manufacturing capabilities – has, on the contrary, mostly been ques-
tioned across subpanels (#12h/j). Overall, online channels (#13) ap-
pear to be increasingly relevant within an omnichannel approach de-
termined by industry-specific elements, such as product complexity and
the presence of legacy sales networks (#13b/f/g). Whenever feasible,
products will increasingly be offered as-a-service (#14) following cus-
tomer expectations and the spread of smart products (#14a/c/d/e/g/i).
Smart cities are expected to gain relevance in this context (#15), e.g., in
the emerging mobility ecosystem (#15c).


In the case of Size (2B), clear concentration dynamics are envisaged
for raw material suppliers (#16) and data management (#20). In data
management, consolidation seems driven by the presence of scale ad-
vantages (#20a/b), IoT technology standardization (#20c) and a lack

of specific capabilities (#20f). The other projections referring to
players’ size actually seem subject to contrasting trends. The ongoing
consolidation of intermediate goods manufacturers across industries
(#17) might be counterbalanced by new production technologies sup-
porting small-scale production (#17e). The same applies to final good
manufacturing (#18): small players could be increasingly involved in
customized production as a result of new technologies (#18a, b), but
large companies might also prefer production internalization to capture
the higher margins of customized products (#18g). New technologies
are also bringing about opportunities for small firms in product design
and software programming (#19), as digital tools simplify the co-
ordination of a large number of suppliers and even single professionals
(#19b/d). These opportunities, however, came out as strongly industry-
dependent (#19e/f/g). Regarding the concentration levels in service
provision (#21) and intermediation activities (#22), the analysis of the
experts’ comments highlights the assumption that digital services and
online channels might be subject to consolidation trends due to data-
related advantages and network effects (#21b, #22a/b). On the other
hand, services requiring on-site presence and physical channels might


still be managed by small local players (#21d/g).
The results for Barriers to entry (2C) are consistent with the picture


illustrated so far. Barriers to entry are expected to partially decrease in
manufacturing (#23) whenever production shifts towards small-scale
models enabled by flexible equipment (#23a). Digitalization of service
provision (#24) and intermediation activities (#25) could be linked to
lower start-up costs (#24a, #25a), but the experts believed relevant
data and technological capabilities not to be accessible to new players
(#24d/e; #25b/d) and customer lock-in strategies to be amply pursued
(#24c, #25c).


Finally, as far as the Location of activities is concerned (2D), the
statistics seem to exclude production reshoring (#26), even though the
content analysis suggests this might be a relevant trend for specific
products and market segments (#26c/h). Along the same lines, the
results for point-of-sale/point-of-use production (#27) are explained by
small-scale production for customization and spare parts (#27c/h). The
location of marketing and sales activities (#28) appears unaffected.

Conclusion The trend towards a global dispersion of VC activities will continue as new countries gain relevance, only partially mitigated by
protectionism, tariffs, and increasing calls for flexibility and sustainability.


Median magnitude: 2019: 3 → 2030: 4 43. Integrated regional supply chains (e.g., North America, Europe, Far East...) serve the needs of their respective markets.


Comments for high magnitude a. The increasing regionalization of supply chains is driven by demand unpredictability and shorter time to market.
b. Production will be organized in regional hubs to serve new geographies of demand (e.g., China, Russia),
c. Supply chains will be more localized to avoid tariffs.
d. Regional/local production will be enabled by increasing system integration along the supply chain.


Comments for low magnitude e. Regional/local production will make sense only for personalized/fast-moving items that will represent a small share of the
overall production volume.


Conclusion Production of high-end/customized products will be organized on a more local basis (not limited to developed countries) to serve relevant
destination markets. Protectionism and tariffs will play a major role in location decisions.

4.2.3. Cross-activity
The analysis referring to the third level of the conceptual framework


– i.e., cross-activity dynamics linking together single activities along the
VC – is included in Table 7.


Overall, the results concerning Governance (3A) show some clear
trajectories. Considering specifically the configuration of manu-
facturing companies, the analysis prognosticates a growth of in-house
capabilities for supply chain data management (#34) and a moderate
internalization of end-of-life product management activities (#31).
With respect to non-manufacturing players integrating within the
manufacturing space, it seemed likely that intermediaries, logistics
operators and service providers will internalize production activities
(#35), as small-scale production models become feasible for customi-
zation and spare parts (#35a/b/g). Intermediaries and digital players
are also projected to develop their product and service offerings (#36,
#37) leveraging on the access to data and the spread of smart products
(#36a, #37b/c). Finally, the results indicate that proprietary technol-
ogies might be increasingly relevant in the future (#38), although this
trend should be seen against a progressive standardization and market
availability of IoT and production technologies (#38c/e).


Other vertical integration decisions of manufacturing companies
seem subject to contrasting dynamics. Internalization of production
activities (#29) could be supported by the increased flexibility of pro-
duction technologies and by the attractive marginalities of customized
products (#29a/b/c); however, digital technologies and cloud manu-
facturing platforms could simplify outsourcing (#29e/f/g) and product
innovation drive vertical specialization (#29l). The internalization of
service provision (#30) emerged as potentially attractive (#30b/c)
notwithstanding the lack of specific skills and capabilities (#30d.). The
disintermediation of sales channels (#32) is similarly envisaged as an
opportunity for manufacturing companies (#32a/b) against the in-
creasing prevalence of digital platforms (#32c). By the same token, the
approach to customer data management (#33) is also better understood
within the broader context of cross-industry synergies and data-specific
scale advantages (#33c/d).


In terms of Rent distribution (3B), a further increase in service mar-
gins (#39) seems to be confirmed despite the price transparency pro-
vided by digital platforms (#39b). The profitability of data manage-
ment activities (#40) will most likely depend on the concentration of
cloud vendors and data marketplaces (#40c); however, control over
data is believed to fundamentally affect the overall performance of
manufacturing companies (#40b). In production (#41), the answers
point to even lower margins (#41b/c) except for late-stage customi-
zation requiring expertise not easily available on the market (#41a/e).


To conclude, as far as the Geographic spread (3C) is concerned,
manufacturing VCs are still expected to develop at global level (#42)
although with an increasing regionalization of supply chains (#43) due
to protectionism and in order to pursue higher flexibility (#42a/b/c;
#43a/c/e).


5. Discussion


The main goal of this study was to provide an outlook on the
paradigmatic characteristics of Industry 4.0 with regards to the con-
figuration of manufacturing companies. Three key trends appear to
characterize the phenomenon. First, the panel expects data to be in-
creasingly relevant across business operations (Projections #2; # 7;
#20; #34; #40) and large manufacturing firms to maintain control and
invest in data-management capabilities for data that represent a source
of competitive advantage, thus raising the bar for new entrants
(Projections #23; #24; #25). The picture is consistent with the litera-
ture on managing data for value creation in the era of big data and
artificial intelligence (e.g., Davenport, 2017; Iansiti and Lahkani, 2020;
Hagiu and Wright, 2020; Spierkemann and Korunustovska, 2017).


Second, servitization appears to be on the rise. An acceleration is
expected in relation to technology-push factors – e.g., smart products


and data-driven services – and demand-pull dynamics such as sustain-
ability concerns, new generations’ lifestyles and cost-efficiency in
business settings (Projections #5; #9; #14; #37; #39). A conceptual
shift from a goods-dominant to a service-dominant logic has long been
documented in the literature (Vargo et al., 2015; Lightfoot et al., 2013;
Green et al., 2017); research has also related the new wave of techno-
logical innovation to increasing servitization opportunities for manu-
facturing companies (e.g., Coreynen et al., 2017; Langley et al., 2020)
and to sharing economy practices (e.g., Acquier et al., 2017;
Geissinger et al., 2020). The “servitization paradox” highlighted by
previous research (e.g., Gebauer et al., 2005; Visnjic and Van
Looy, 2013) is reflected in the results for Projection #39, as overall
services are expected to capture more and more value, but there are
concerns among the respondents in relation to complex payment
schemes and consumers’ willingness to pay.


Third, experts largely expect supply chains and operations foot-
prints to be reshaped by new products and processes. Raw material
suppliers will be impacted by the increasing demand for sustainable
products– e.g., organic fibers and metals for electric batteries – and by
the emergence of smart products: research into substitute or smart
materials is expected to flourish (Projections #3; #10; #16; #38).
Results (Projections #4; #31) also confirm an intimate relationship
between Industry 4.0 and circular economy practices (e.g., Nascimento
et al., 2019; Kouhizadeh et al., 2020; Rosa et al., 2020). Vice versa, the
widespread expectations for small-scale localized production models
(e.g., Srai et al., 2016; Montes and Olleros, 2019) and for the reshoring
phenomenon (e.g., Barbieri et al., 2017; Dachs et al., 2019) do not come
out so clearly from the results. Even though an increasing regional or-
ganization of supply chains is expected (Projection #42), new models
seem applicable mainly to volatile high-value product categories
leaving the bulk of mass market production relatively unaffected
(Projections #6; #8; #26; #35), while new outsourcing opportunities
seem less relevant as focal companies internalize high-margin produc-
tion (Projections #11; #29; #41).


Overall, the results also confirm that emerging configurations in
manufacturing need to be analyzed against broader evolutionary dy-
namics stretching beyond traditional industry boundaries (Projection
#5). Non-manufacturing companies – in particular digital players and
platform-based intermediaries – are expected to compete head-to-head
with industry incumbents for high-value opportunities (Projections
#36; #37). The increasing prevalence of online channels and platform-
based value intermediation is projected to affect customer expectations,
product variety, and demand volatility (Projections #12; #13; #15).
The timing and characteristics of technological standardization are
basically linked to manufacturers’ investments in proprietary technol-
ogies and their sources of competitive advantage (Projection #38).


In order to better understand these cross-industry dynamics, we
believe that further analyses are required as the ways in which Industry
4.0 is changing manufacturing VCs’ “control points” – i.e., which ac-
tivities along the VC hold the greater value or power (Rülke et al., 2003;
Pagani, 2013) – within increasingly complex networks of business
partners and competitors. Data ownership (Projections #20; #23; #24;
#25; #34; #40), control over sales channels (Projection #22; #32),
standardization of IoT product-service platforms (Projections #37;
#38) emerged from our study as increasingly relevant elements, and
still occupy a contested territory between manufacturing incumbents
and born-digital companies. The future of many manufacturing com-
panies may depend on their ability to early identify and seize oppor-
tunities and challenges related to the rapid evolution of such control
points.


5.1. Eight scenarios for manufacturing in 2030


The results of the Delphi study unveiled several uncertainties be-
hind the expert judgements. Some of these uncertainties recurred very
frequently in the comments related to several projections across the


G. Culot, et al.






various levels and sub-levels of our conceptual framework (Tables 5–7).
We analyzed how these uncertainties – also called “drivers” in the
scenario planning literature – may unfold in time and determine dif-
ferent configurations of manufacturing VCs. Our analysis identified four
main drivers leading to eight analytically coherent presentations of
possible futures (Fig. 3), namely “scenarios” (van Notten et al., 2003;
Bishop et al., 2007).


The first driver refers to the dominant demand characteristics by
2030. Two trends emerged as controversial. One is related to demand
volatility and customization/personalization of physical products (i.e.,
“customization”), the other to product servitization and non-ownership
models (i.e., “servitization”). These two trends should not be seen as
conceptual alternatives (e.g., Sousa and Silveira, 2019), yet they
emerged from the expert assessment as distinct options under the as-
sumption that with physical products being “shared rather than owned,
there will be no need to customize”. For the purpose of scenario de-
velopment, we assumed either one of these demand characteristics to be
dominant in the future.


The second driver approaches the question of data transparency
along the VC. We already discussed how data are expected to be in-
creasingly relevant. Notwithstanding “cross-industry synergies and
data-specific scale advantages”, several comments underscored that
“data will be retained at the company level as they are a source of
competitive advantage”. However, many efficiency- and innovation-
related benefits are expected to come from data sharing
(Kagermann et al., 2013; Evans and Annunziata, 2012; Liao et al.,
2017). Policymakers are working on a solution for legal issues related to
the access to and transfer of non-personal machine-generated data, data
liability, as well as portability of non-personal data, interoperability
and standards (e.g., European Commission, 2020). Intellectual property
legislation is also expected to evolve to reap the benefits of new pro-
duction models (e.g., Kurfess and Cass, 2014; Steenhuis and
Pretorius, 2017; Chan et al., 2018). The evolution of the regulatory
environment, new technical solutions for interoperability and integra-
tion together with some early success examples might increase data
sharing practices in the future. In the scenarios, we assumed two ex-
treme states of data transparency: “high”, i.e., full real-time visibility on
suppliers’ processes and the opportunity to easily acquire customer data
on the market and “low”, i.e., operations and marketing data are strictly
kept within organizational boundaries.


The third driver calls into question the maturity of AMTs and ad-
vanced robotics. The rapid developments and successful applications of
new production technologies – especially AMTs – have often fueled
huge expectations (e.g., Jiang et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019b). Aca-
demic research has also underlined ongoing limitations in their ap-
plicability (e.g., LaPlume et al., 2016; Durach et al., 2017) and their
cost-effectiveness in large-scale manufacturing operations (e.g.,
Atzeni et al., 2010; Baumers et al., 2016; 2017; Baumers and
Holweg, 2019). These concerns were echoed in several experts’ com-
ments. In our analysis, the hypothesis of a “high” maturity describes a
future where AMTs and advanced robotics can easily be bought on the
market and applied cost-effectively on a broad range of products, vice
versa “low” maturity assumes that these technologies do not apply. This
driver is relevant for the production of physical products and thus has
been considered only for the customization scenarios.


The last driver is related to the penetration of smart products.
Academic research and practical whitepapers exhibit optimism towards
the current technological issues related to smart products, e.g., cyber-
security, networking, and standardization of communication protocols
(Atzori et al., 2010; 2017). However, their spread might be limited in
non-durable consumer goods (e.g., Bertola and Teunissen, 2018), as the
results indicate for the Apparel and Footwear subpanel. Even in more
mature industries, the penetration of smart products could be unevenly
spread across geographies due to the need for support infrastructure, as
in the case of autonomous vehicles (e.g., Cavazza et al., 2019). This
driver applies to the servitization scenarios only. We considered as


“high” the full applicability and spread of smart products and as “low”
no applicability at all.


The scenarios resulting from the combination of these four drivers
are illustrated in Fig. 3 and their core mechanisms briefly outlined
below.


The common denominator of the four “customization” scenarios is a
new approach to production in order to meet a highly fragmented de-
mand. The abundant literature on mass customization in operations and
supply chain management provides the starting point (e.g., Fogliatto
et al., 2012; Suzić et al., 2018). In the first two scenarios – (1) pro-
duction commoditization and (2) end-to-end VC transparency – high
levels of data transparency enable efficient outsourcing due to a de-
crease in transaction costs (Coarse, 1937; Williamson 1987). In scenario
(1) a low AMTs’ asset specificity makes suppliers virtually inter-
changeable (McGuiness, 1994; Lonsdale, 2001). This, in turn, leads to
price pressures, commoditization of production, and efficiency-seeking
efforts. As a result, a process of market consolidation takes place; new
manufacturing giants operate a broad network of localized production
facilities. In scenario (2) end-to-End VC transparency focal companies
orchestrate articulated supply chains of specialized manufacturers of
intermediate goods. The core dynamics of this scenario are explained
through the resource dependency theory (Donaldson, 2001): because of
specialized capabilities, suppliers have at their disposal high bargaining
power against the focal company, maintain high barriers to entry, and
retain some of the extra profit related to customization. The remaining
two “customization” scenarios are based on the opposing logic for
outsourcing. Data-related transaction costs make it inconvenient for
focal companies to coordinate suppliers within very short time inter-
vals, which is needed required for customization. The higher margins
related to customized products drive production internalization in
scenario (3) in-house production. In case AMTs and advanced robotics
will not be available – as in scenario (4) in-house technology – focal
companies are incentivized to invest in proprietary technology in order
to reduce the labor-intensity of production processes.


The four “servitization” scenarios elaborate on manufacturing
companies disintermediating sales and service networks as opposed to
digital players and platforms developing their own offering. Central to
our line of reasoning is the literature on manufacturing servitization
(e.g., Baines and Lightfoot, 2014; Berret et al., 2015; Story et al., 2017)
as well as the ever-growing research on platforms, both from an “eco-
nomic” and an “engineering design” perspective (e.g., Gawer, 2014;
McIntyre and Srinivasan, 2017). The “engineering design” perspective –
i.e., platforms as technological architectures to orchestrate a set of
system complementors (e.g., Elorata and Turunen, 2016; Ondrus et al.,
2015; Wei et al., 2019; Broekhuizen et al., 2020) – is at the basis of
scenario (5) open smart ecosystems. Industry 4.0 solutions demand high
interdependencies of competences and technological complementarity,
thus often give rise to innovation ecosystems (e.g. Benitez et al., 2020).
In this scenario highly specialized players are involved through IoT
platforms based on an open architecture. Data transparency offers re-
latively equal opportunities for value capture to the various firms in-
volved. The “economic perspective” of platform research – i.e., plat-
forms as multi-sided markets (e.g., Eisenmann et al., 2011;
Cennamo and Santalo, 2013; Ghazawneh and Henfridsson, 2015) – is
the most relevant for scenario (6) platform-based renting/leasing. This
scenario describes a situation where platforms become the dominant
models in value intermediation. In a regime of high data transparency,
low barriers to entry prevent “winner takes all” dynamics. In both
scenarios (5) and (6) high data transparency coupled with cross-in-
dustry market ecosystems triggers the commoditization of data man-
agement activities. Scenario (7) in-house smart servitization describes a
head-to-head competition among industry incumbents, digital players
and intermediaries. Manufacturers orchestrate their own IoT platform-
based architectures and build up a competitive advantage through the
ownership of product in-use data and the internalization of sales
channels together with core services. Digital players and intermediaries


G. Culot, et al.






capitalize on their access to customer data and invest in their own IoT
product-service architectures so as to grow across different industries.
In the last scenario – (8) enhanced renting/leasing – traditional products
are offered as a service. In a regime of low data transparency manu-
facturers and intermediaries internalize services that guarantee extra
profit.


Although these eight scenarios are based on extreme future states of
their underlying drivers, there already exist actual examples that fit at
least in part into similar narratives. An in-depth analysis of such ex-
amples is outside the scope of this paper.


6. Conclusions


In this study we addressed the impact of Industry 4.0 on manu-
facturing VCs with a holistic perspective and a broad technological
focus. Based on an extensive analysis of the literature, a series of
workshops, and a Delphi study involving 76 experts (academics and
practitioners), we identified the key dimensions of change (Section 2
and 3) and assessed their relevance by 2030 (Section 4). Starting from
these analyses, we put forward an analytical perspective presented in
the form of drivers and scenarios (Section 5).


Our paper contributes to the growing literature on Industry 4.0 in at
least three significant ways. First, it promotes a cross-disciplinary de-
bate drawing from different streams of research that have investigated
the issue separately so far. The study links literature in operations and
supply chain management with strategy and business model research,
including broad-range considerations on topics such as manufacturing
servitization, mass customization, technological platforms and multi-
sided markets, reshoring, and redistributed manufacturing. Second, our
results describe the emerging paradigmatic characteristics of Industry
4.0, building on the assessment of expert academics and practitioners.
This description confirms some dynamics highlighted in the literature,
while putting into perspective other evolutionary trajectories, such as
new production models, reshoring and individual prosumers. Third, the
formulation of eight scenarios (see Fig. 3) presents a range of possible
futures, making explicit how Industry 4.0 is prone to different context-
specific variations that can be traced back to four key drivers, namely
demand characteristics, transparency of data among value chain par-
ticipants, maturity of additive manufacturing and advanced robotics,
and penetration of smart products.


The paper has also implications for managers, consultants and
policy makers. As we explained in the methodology section, the study
was carried out in collaboration with the Boston Consulting Group
(BCG), which was involved in the identification of the research question
as well as in various brainstorming and validation sessions. Starting
from here, the conceptual model (Fig. 2) and the list of projections
(Table 2) can be used in strategic planning exercises as an assessment
tool by companies, business associations, consulting firms, or regions/
countries to identify future scenarios specific for a particular company,
sector and/or geographical area. The four drivers identified as de-
terminants of the different future scenarios (i.e., demand character-
istics, transparency of data among value chain participants, maturity of
additive manufacturing and advanced robotics, and penetration of
smart products) might also be considered separately to delve into the
most compelling uncertainties behind strategy formulation. The pro-
jections – or more likely a sub-set of them – might be analyzed by the
aforementioned subject either through workshops and focus groups or
through Delphi studies (as applied in this paper). Managers and con-
sultants of companies operating in Apparel and Footwear, Automotive,
and Machinery and Equipment may leverage our specific results (Tables
5–7) as direct input. Similarly, some specific findings might be used as a
guideline for policy interventions (e.g., highlighting aspects, practices
or sectors requiring more specific legislation).


The study is not exempt from limitations. The most crucial ones
refer to the common downsides of forecasting with respect to un-
expected events having significant (disruptive) impacts. As we write,


the pandemic related to the coronavirus COVID-19 is seriously affecting
a large and growing number of countries around the world. The current
state of emergency impedes further considerations on how this may
affect the results of our study. Other general limitations refer to possible
biases in participants’ judgment formulation, as broadly discussed in
Plous (2007) and Derbyshire and Wright (2014), while peculiar to our
study are possible effects on the results determined by the selection of
the industries to be included in the assessment and by the panel com-
position, which was skewed towards experts from European countries
and from the US, and included mostly executives from incumbent
companies.


Several opportunities for future research arise from our study. The
logical next step would be for the scenarios (Section 5.1) to be sub-
stantiated with empirical studies to understand their relevance and
boundary conditions, as well as with theory-based research focused on
explaining their mechanisms. Our effort might also be replicated in the
service sector, to better understand emerging trajectories across current
industry boundaries. The most relevant research opportunities refer to
how VC “control points” (Section 5) will evolve in the light of emerging
cross-industry ecosystems. The issue of data pinpoints this debate,
managerial research is essential to understand barriers, benefits and
drawbacks of data sharing with business partners and emerging data
governance modes. Policy research should work to suggest a portfolio
of long-term action points addressing the potential dark sides of data-
sharing in manufacturing. Other research topics are more specific, and
refer to the implementation of small-scale production modes, the in-
terplay between Industry 4.0 and circular economy practices, the
technological determinants of reshoring, and IoT standardization ef-
fects on competition.


To conclude, in this peculiar historical moment, it remains im-
possible to predict how long this health crisis will last and its impact on
the economy at the global level. At present, targeted responses must
ensure that economic systems and individual organizations survive the
shock in the short-term. In the long run, structural measures will be
required to inject new impetus into the economy in the face of gloomy
prospects of recession and unemployment. Among these structural
measures, we expect investments in innovation – more likely backed by
public incentives – to turn again the spotlight on the Industry 4.0 tra-
jectory. Making the right decisions requires, however, that the options
and their implications are well understood; it can only be hoped that –
once the sanitary emergency is over – the preparations of our business
leaders and policymakers will not be found wanting. In many respects
the current understanding of the nature of Industry 4.0 is still blurred:
different scenarios seem equally possible today depending on some
crucial issues in relation to data, technologies, and demand character-
istics. The effects of how these issues are approached will be profound
not only for the future of individual companies but also for the com-
petitiveness of manufacturing economies across the globe.
