This paper investigates the major implications of blockchain technology for operations management (OM) with a
focus on the decision-making processes in supply chain management (SCM) from the perspective of sustainable
performance. The links between blockchain technology, OM, and sustainability issues within SCM are analysed.
This two-step research study includes a broad review of the main contributions in the literature that have
focused on blockchain technology and OM in SCM. It covers the airport industry from the perspective of sus-
tainable performance and data analysis by reading and processing financial statements, non-financial reports,
and the website of one strategic airport infrastructure in southern Italy. The Italian airport infrastructure in-
vestigated successfully adopted the Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM) platform. This is one of the
main blockchain technology applications in the airport industry. It promotes cooperation between the main
players in the aviation industry and the air traffic controllers (ATCs) to reduce fragmentation, inefficiency, and
uncoordinated operations. It also allows information and data sharing, but it is still not possible to observe a high
level of sustainable performance.
Although the adoption of blockchain technology presents numerous benefits, especially in improving OM,


these new technological solutions do not guarantee the achievement of the best performance in terms of ef-
fectiveness, efficiency, and sustainability issues. Managers and policy makers need to work together to create a
real forum within their collaborative network in which there is a common culture and mutual trust. This article
adds an interesting reading of blockchain technology to the existing research with concerns about OM and
sustainability issues within the airport setting in Italy.


1. Introduction


Blockchain technology is able to transform significantly many ac-
tivities and operations in the supply chain that require increasing at-
tention from scholars and practitioners (Kshetri, 2018). Indeed, the
growing use of new technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT)
and artificial intelligence (AI) applications, will affect supply chain
management (SCM) (Apte and Petrovsky, 2016; Kshetri, 2018; Saberi,
Cruz, Sarkis, & Nagurney, 2018). For instance, blockchain technology
enables one to enhance and track goods and passengers in real time
from their origins through the overall SCM. In the supply chain,
blockchain technology enables all of the actors to know who is per-
forming which actions by defining and evidencing the time and location
of the actions. One of the most direct relevant benefits of blockchain
technology is the provision of possible solutions for identity manage-
ment (Alam, 2016). Blockchain technology implies positive and


negative effects on the overall business world (Aste, Tasca, & Di Matteo,
2017; Giungato, Rana, Tarabella, & Tricase, 2017; Kewell, Adams, &
Parry, 2017; Kshetri, 2018; Lu & Xu, 2017; Vranken, 2017). Specifi-
cally, disruptive technologies have been making crucial transformations
and changing all the end-to-end production and business models in the
major economic sectors. Because of blockchain technology, global SCM
is being rethought, redesigned, and reshaped. The adoption of these
new technological solutions is revolutionising the processes that have
traditionally been used for creating value. The advent of blockchain
technology provides greater spatial and temporal flexibility. New
technology is bringing operations, production, and sales closer to-
gether, and it is promoting significant changes by rethinking, re-
designing, and reshaping the operations management (OM) of supply
chains.


The existing contributions in the literature still do not provide sig-
nificant knowledge about the implications of blockchain technology for

future industries, especially regarding its practical application and the
main effects on OM in SCM (Beck & Müller-Bloch, 2017; Büyüközkan &
Göçer, 2018; Fosso Wamba, Kamdjoug, Robert, Bawack, & G Keogh,
2018; Tian, 2016).


Numerous studies have reported significant benefits of blockchain
technology in logistics and the supply chain (Hughes et al., 2019;
Kamble, Gunasekaran, & Arha, 2019; Kamble, Gunasekaran, & Sharma,
2019; Morkunas, Paschen, & Boon, 2019; Queiroz & Fosso Wamba,
2019; Shuetz & Venkatesh, 2019; Tönnissen & Teuteberg, 2019; Wang,
Singgih, Wang, & Rit, 2019; Wang, Han, & Beynon-Davies, 2019; Ying,
Jia, & Du, 2018). These benefits include improved cybersecurity and
protection (Kshetri, 2017), transparency and accountability (Kshetri,
2018; Zou et al., 2018), traceability and fraud prevention (Biswas,
Muthukkumarasamy, & Tan, 2018; Chen, 2018; Lu & Xu, 2017), and so
forth. Blockchain technology is able to redefine, redesign, and remodel
the characteristics of the relationships between all the players in the
supply chain (Queiroz & Fosso Wamba, 2019).


Adopting blockchain technology in SCM makes OM safer, more
transparent, traceable, and efficient (Aste et al., 2017; Kshetri, 2018).
Furthermore, blockchain technology is able to increase the cooperation
between the members of SCM (Aste et al., 2017), with indirect positive
effects on cost and efficiency in the supply chain. Blockchain tech-
nology can also enhance customers’ trust, thanks to the traceability of
goods during their entire journey across the supply chain (Biswas et al.,
2017). Furthermore, it supports the prevention of product fraud and
fakes across the supply chains (Chen, 2018), which has a positive im-
pact in terms of cost reduction and efficiency.


Otherwise, blockchain technology applied to SCM is still in its in-
fancy (Queiroz & Fosso Wamba, 2019), because firms tend to pay too
much attention to the adoption phase and neglect other features, such
as the organisational and managerial strategies and policies needed for
successful blockchain technology and the link to the three components
of sustainability (environmental, social, and economic sustainability)
(Elkington, 1997; Kajikawa, 2008; Schoolman, Guest, Bush, & Bell,
2012).


Drawing from past research, this paper aims to investigate the main
implications derived from blockchain technology for OM and focuses
the attention on the decision-making processes related to operations in
the supply chain. It adopts the perspective of sustainable performance
with a focus on the airport industry.


Specifically, sustainable performance, related to the concept of
sustainability, can balance the three sets of criteria that are related to
the environmental, social, and economic components of sustainability
(Elkington, 1997; Kajikawa, 2008; Schoolman et al., 2012). Thus, firms
that perform in a sustainable manner are able to provide their products
with respect to these criteria. However, most literature on this topic has
pointed out that the balance is not easy to achieve. Therefore, eco-
nomic, financial, social, and environmental components are sometimes
in conflict from the sustainable performance perspective (Boons &
Wagner, 2009; Boons, Montalvo, Quist, & Wagner, 2013; Pullman,
Maloni, & Carter, 2009; Spreitzer & Porath, 2012). For this reason,
scholars and practitioners have investigated the organisational, ac-
counting, and reporting practices or policies that enable firms to
achieve sustainable performance and create the right equilibrium be-
tween the three mentioned components. They have also proposed
several measures to promote environmental, social, and economic
sustainability (Hoejmose & Adrien-Kirby, 2012; Seuring & Müller,
2008).


Thus, we analyse the link between blockchain technology, opera-
tions management, and sustainability issues within SCM. In this case,
considering the link between blockchain technology and sustainability
within SCM, we focus mainly on so-called sustainable supply chain
management (SSCM). By adopting a sustainable supply chain perspec-
tive, firms tend to focus much more on searching for clear, transparent,
and effective sustainable practices, thus considering blockchain tech-
nology and its social, environmental, and economic impact (Saberi,


Kouhizadeh, Sarkis, & Shen, 2019; Steiner & Baker, 2015). Although
scholars have paid attention to blockchain technology, OM, and SCM
from the perspective of sustainability, defining SSCM, the contributions
regarding this issue are still scarce. This is especially true for the pos-
sible negative effects of blockchain technology on OM within SCM for
sustainable performance and for the identification, development, and
implementation of effective organisational and managerial practices
that are able to increase the positive impact of blockchain technology in
the direction of SSCM.


Consequently, our research questions are the following: “What are
the major effects of blockchain technology on operations management
for achieving sustainable performance in SCM, making the idea of
SSCM possible?” and “What are the main managerial and technological
solutions for preventing and managing blockchain disruptions in the
airport industry?”


To achieve this research goal, an exploratory study was conducted
and articulated in two different steps. Thus, this paper consists of a
theoretical and a practical study. At the beginning, we analyse the
major contributions in the literature on the phenomenon investigated to
point out the research gap that still exists and the primary directions to
follow for the subsequent practical analysis. The first part provides a
broad review of the literature. Second, we adopted a case study
methodology, through secondary data analysis, to investigate the im-
plications of blockchain technology for operations management and the
involvement of the players within the supply chain related to the air-
port industry to achieve high sustainable performance.


The airport sector was chosen as the research context for three main
reasons. First, the airport industry plays a relevant role in SCM. Indeed,
airports constitute critical nodes in the air transport system and con-
sequently in territory connectivity. They are also part of the aviation
sector. Second, the airport industry has experienced important changes
resulting from blockchain technology through the adoption of new and
technologically advanced applications. Finally, the airport sector has an
increasingly recognised environmental, social, and economic impact,
which requires considerable attention in the search for technical and
managerial solutions to achieve sustainable performance while over-
coming the negative effects of technological disruptions. Our emphasis
is on an Italian airport infrastructure with a strategic role and core
position within the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) and a
significant impact on the local community.


The primary findings show the need to investigate the airport in-
dustry and to pay most attention to the main effects of blockchain
technology on OM from the perspective of sustainability. The Italian
airport infrastructure investigated has successfully adopted the plat-
form Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM). This is one of the
most relevant blockchain technology applications in the airport in-
dustry. It promotes cooperation between the main players in the avia-
tion industry and the air traffic controllers (ATCs) to reduce in-
efficiency, fragmentation, and uncoordinated operations and to
stimulate and manage information and data sharing. However, it is still
not possible to observe high sustainable performance. A-CDM consists
of a technologically advanced platform that is able to reduce airport
mistakes and incidents and en route delays significantly and to optimise
airport operations. It enables the improvement of efficient turnaround
processes, gate management, point congestion, and flight predictability
through real-time data exchange for air navigation services. A-CDM
permits accurate and timely information sharing among airport part-
ners and the implementation of operational procedures and automated
processes that benefit all of the operations at the airport. Thus, A-CDM
makes more efficient use of the existing capacity and resources. It also
provides resilience and potentially better recovery from disrupted days.
Furthermore, it can significantly reduce the operating costs for fuel
burn, which can have an impact on environmental targets (Corrigan
et al., 2015; IATA Report A-CDM, 2018).


Thus, the main contribution of this study consists of analysing to-
gether topics that are usually considered separately, especially the

connection between sustainable performance and operations manage-
ment through the adoption of blockchain technology. In more detail,
this study can represent a useful guideline for investigating the man-
agerial solutions needed for effectively and successfully adopting
blockchain technology from the sustainable performance perspective
within the airport industry, which is one of the most significant in-
dustries in SCM. Hence, our theoretical and empirical study provides
suggestions about how to collect, elaborate, and read useful informa-
tion and data from documentation (financial and non-financial reports,
websites, etc.) to understand the positive and negative effects of
blockchain technology on sustainable performance.


This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the metho-
dology adopted in the study, which consists of a two-step research
approach that employs a broad review and case study methodology.
Sections 3.1, and 3.2 provide a review of the main concepts for the
research, such as the major issues related to blockchain technology,
OM, and sustainability as applied to the airport industry. In Section 4
the case study is described, and in Section 5 the main results are out-
lined and discussed. Section 6 provides management implications. Fi-
nally, Section 7 describes the conclusions and limitations of the study
and makes suggestions for future research.


2. Methodology


This theoretical and practical study followed a two-step research
process. First, we conducted a broad review of the main contributions
in the literature regarding blockchain technology. We took into account
especially the relationship between technology, operations, sustain-
ability, and SCM. Moreover, we investigated these topics and their
combination in the airport industry, which is continuously and sig-
nificantly characterised by deep changes in terms of technological in-
novations but still under-researched. We followed the typical stages for
conducting a broad review of the literature (Booth, Sutton, &
Papaioannou, 2016; Dickersin, Scherer, & Lefebvre, 1994; Moher et al.,
2008; Randolph, 2009).


In the primary step of the study, the online search adopted and
combined specific key words, specifically “blockchain”, “technology”,
“blockchain technology”, “operation management”, “supply chain”,
“sustainable operations”, “technological applications”, “sustainable
performance”, “technology and airport”, “disruption management and
airline industry”, “aviation industry”, and “managerial solutions for
blockchain technology”. These keywords needed to appear in the title,
abstract, or keywords of the papers in our research. This search was
performed in two freely accessible web search engines that specialise in
academic contributions, that is, the ISI Web of Science (WoS) and
Google Scholar (GS). The search identified 68 research papers, distin-
guishing three main research issues and areas investigated, namely
blockchain technology (39), sustainability (15), and the airport in-
dustry (14).


Second, we considered only papers in academic journals published
during the last decade, 2008–2018, including the first 6 months of
2019. We started our research in 2008 because blockchain technology
began to receive attention from scholars and become an interesting
research topic only recently. Third, the papers had to have been pub-
lished in English and to contain at least one of the selected words and
terms in the title, abstract, and keywords. The papers had to have dealt
with research issues and the keywords blockchain technology, techno-
logical applications, operations management, SCM, sustainability,
technology, and airports. Fourth, all of the identified studies were
analysed using spreadsheet software to identify the relationships be-
tween the issues investigated (Fig. 1).


The literature review outlined two main elements. The phenomenon
investigated is still underrepresented in the research. Above all, the
major primary directions and features were identified to take into ac-
count in the subsequent practical analysis. We conducted this qualita-
tive research study to verify the adoption of blockchain technologies in


the Italian airport infrastructure. We found evidence of the benefits, but
we mainly identified the main practices developed in the blockchain
technology frame.


In the second step of our study, we developed an empirical analysis
using case study methodology. Specifically, we used the insights gath-
ered from our literature review as a guide for the design and execution
of our qualitative research. Until now, research has been unable to
provide suggestions for specific managerial solutions that could be
adopted to implement blockchain technology effectively and success-
fully, especially concerning sustainable performance within SCM and in
the direction of SSCM.


An archival data analysis through reading and processing financial
statements and non-financial reports (sustainability and social re-
porting) and a thorough reading of the website of a strategic airport
infrastructure in southern Italy (Napoli-Capodichino airport) was per-
formed. With reference to this last point, we checked the last update of
the websites and investigated the non-financial documents provided by
websites using the keywords “sustainable performance”, “blockchain”,
“technology”, “blockchain technology”, “operation management”,
“technology investments”, and “technology strategies”.


The following phases characterised the empirical analysis con-
ducted on the selected Italian airport. First, we analysed the website of
the airport system for evidence of the type of content and information
provided in terms of the technologies used (blockchain technology),
sustainable performance, and the mission and vision of the organisa-
tion. Second, we collected and examined reports and official documents
(financial statements and non-financial reports were taken into ac-
count) related to sustainability, finance, and governance. The official
financial and non-financial documents and the reports and manuals of
the selected airport were collected through an Internet search. The
websites and all of the available published documentation (reports,
documents, archival data, and so forth) were read and investigated.
Then, they were analysed using spreadsheet software regarding the
identified relationships concerned with our research objectives. This
allowed us to identify the major tools (advanced technologies) used
within the airport system to perform its processes and manage its op-
erations.


The academic literature has recognised and clearly identified the
case study approach as a useful method that is able to investigate
phenomena that are as yet unexplored (Eisenhardt, 1989; Gibbert,
Ruigrok, & Wicki, 2008; Scapens, 2004). Case studies allow us to ex-
amine phenomena separately from their context and to consider spe-
cific variables (2013, Yin, 1994). Through reading and processing fi-
nancial statements, non-financial reports, and the website of the Napoli-
Capodichino airport, we investigated the case of this airport and col-
lected related information and data concerning blockchain technology
(specifically the A-CDM application), OM, SSC, and sustainable per-
formance. The Napoli-Capodichino airport was chosen for several rea-
sons. First, this airport is the most representative of airports in Italy,
especially in the south. It is considered by the Italian regulation (see
D.P.R. 17 September 2015, no. 201) as strategic due to its location, size,
and traffic volume (passengers and goods) and its core position in the
Trans-European Transport Network in Europe, that is, the infrastructure
– TEN-T – connecting Europe; thus, it is one part of the Network
Manager of EUROCONTROL. Second, this airport presents a strategic
position along important traffic routes that cross the Mediterranean
region. Third, it has recorded a large increase in the volume of cargo
and passenger traffic. For instance, in 2018, the airport served around
10million passengers, and this record is a significant increase from
2000 (+15.8%) (Statistiche Assaeroporti, 2019). Additionally, in June
2017, the airport was awarded the “Aci Europe Award” as the best in
Europe in the 5–10m category of passengers. It was especially re-
cognised for the services provided, which were characterised by a high
degree of innovativeness, and the substantial attention paid to custo-
mers. In addition, in 2018, the airport was the first in its category to win
the “Fast and Furious” title. This award is presented to the airport that

has achieved the greatest growth in Europe, and the airport increased
its number of passengers by about 15.8% from 6,775,988 passengers in
2016 to 8,577,507 passengers in 2017 (Statistiche Assaeroporti, 2019).


This airport has also been paying increasing attention to the three
features of sustainability (environmental, social, and economic dimen-
sions) as well as to innovation management and technology innovation
related to blockchain technology. Indeed, this international airport is
the first airport in Italy to use electric buses, starting in the winter of
2018, thanks to a partnership between two companies (Gesac and
Handler). Finally, this airport is located in a city. This means that the
airport’s activities and operations for passengers and cargo can have a
relevant and direct impact on the overall community and territory (e.g.,
air and noise emissions and waste management).


3. Literature review: Blockchain technology and operations
management in SCM


The results of our review allowed us to collect some interesting data
and make some considerations. The research papers that our search
identified were published in many top-tier journals, mainly the
International Journal of Information Management (11), Journal of Cleaner
Production (6), Sustainability (4), International Journal of Production
Economics (2), and Production and Operations Management (2). Most
papers concerning the issues investigated were published in specialised
and contextualised journals, such as the Journal of Air Transport
Management, or in conference proceedings and working paper books.
We specifically did not consider conference proceedings and working
paper books in our review, but we consulted them to improve our
knowledge of the phenomenon investigated. The presence of papers on
the three research areas, also in combination, has recorded significant
growth in the last five years (2014–2019), showing that this phenom-
enon is becoming very important and is receiving more attention from
scholars and operators, also in the airport industry. The sample includes
papers and journals mostly related to the management field in general
and to the airport industry, according to the criteria adopted in the web
search. The search outlined significant elements that have received
increasing attention from scholars on the phenomenon and, more spe-
cifically, on the link between “blockchain technology” and the “airport
industry”, which has become stronger over the years with the concern
about sustainability issues. Regarding the “blockchain technology”


research area, most publications are available in the Journal of
Information Management.


As shown by the results of the review, scholars have mainly focused
on investigating the major positive and negative effects of blockchain
technology on firm performance, paying attention mostly to processes
and operations management within supply chains. Then, the main
studies on sustainability issues in the airport industry linked to block-
chain technology and, in general, technology have focused on subtopics
such as “environmental sustainability” and “green airport develop-
ment” (Table 1).


Blockchain technology started to be considered only recently, “be-
coming one of the mostly promising technologies of the new economy”
(Kamble, Gunasekaran, Arha et al., 2019; 2019b, p. 2). Indeed, it ap-
peared for the first time in 2008, and it was implemented in 2009
(Nakamoto, 2008), but its identity was not clarified and formalised
then. Most of the attention in the practice of blockchain technology has
been paid to its applications concerning the cryptocurrency bitcoin
(Nakamoto, 2008; Zheng, Xie, Dai, Chen, & Wang, 2018).


According to Beck and Müller-Bloch (2017) blockchain technology
consists of distributed ledger technology (DLT), that is, a distributed
transactional database, in which the security and trust for collecting
and sharing data are guaranteed by cryptography through a consensus
mechanism. Thus, “Blockchain could be regarded as a public ledger in
which all committed transactions are stored in a chain of blocks which
continuously grows when new blocks are appended to it” (Zheng et al.,
2018, p. 354). The key characteristics of blockchain technology, re-
cognised as the main benefits, are decentralisation, persistency, anon-
ymity, and auditability. Thanks to blockchain technology, any trans-
action can be performed in a decentralised fashion. Consequently, the
cost can be greatly reduced and the efficiency improved (Zheng et al.,
2018). Indeed, blockchain technology, conceived as a new type of
disruptive internet technology, is broadly used for technologically
supporting enterprises in improving their production processes and
reducing their costs (Pan, Pan, Song, Ai, & Ming, 2019).


Blockchain technology allows users to record digital facts, but it
cannot be considered simply as “a record”, because it takes into account
many other features, such as smart contracts for preventing and re-
sponding to technological disruptions, like fraud (Buterin, 2014).
Blockchain is mainly associated with the technology that enables
cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, but, by defining the concept of

blockchain technology with its other applications, it can also be linked
to significant economic and social transactions (Beck et al., 2017;
Lindman, Tuunainen, & Rossi, 2017). As already outlined, one of the
most promising technologies for the next generation of internet inter-
action systems is blockchain technology, with its many applications,
such as in public services, smart contracts, IoT, reputation systems, and
security services (Akins, Chapman, & Gordon, 2013; Kosba, Miller, Shi,
Wen, & Papamanthou, 2016; Noyes, 2016; Sharples & Domingue, 2016;
Zhang & Wen, 2015). Otherwise, as numerous applications of block-
chain technology have been identified, an increasing number of studies
have been conducted from various sources and with different view-
points, like blogs, wikis, forum posts, codes, conference proceedings,
and journal papers (NRI, 2015; Tschorsch & Scheuermann, 2016;
Zheng, Xie, Dai, Chen, & Wang, 2017, 2018).


The inter-individual and inter-organisational relationships can be
developed and managed significantly thanks to a distributed record
system characterised by a high level of reliability, authentication, and
trust (Beck et al., 2017;Mainelli & Smith, 2015; Ølnes, Ubacht, &
Janssen, 2017; Palfreyman, 2015; Swan, 2015; Yli-Huumo, Ko, Choi,
Park, & Smolander, 2016; Zyskind & Nathan, 2015). “Wherever people,
processes, businesses, governments, or the social good requires proof of
identity, ownership, transactions, or commitments, Blockchain tech-
nologies promise to meet those needs with a degree of trust and in-
tegrity never before possible” (Jack Shaw, Executive Director American
Blockchain Council). Thus, blockchain technology can successfully
meet the relevant needs of the actors in any economic and social setting
in terms of trust, integrity, and efficiency.


To make blockchain technology, and consequently the overall eco-
nomic system, work successfully, it is necessary to develop the condi-
tions in which individuals and organisations can trust other parties in
creating, storing, and distributing fundamental records. For instance, in
many service industries, like healthcare, banking, financing, transport,
and education, organisations construct and maintain records through
third parties. For this reason, it is very important to prevent corruption
or human mistakes in record repositories by using blockchain-based
digital systems (Nærland, Müller-Bloch, Beck, & Palmund, 2017).
Nevertheless, especially for producing and delivering services, block-
chain technology can play a crucial role within supply chains (Kamble,
Gunasekaran, Arha et al., 2019, 2019b; Wong, Leong, Hew, Tan, & Ooi,
2019), which entail interconnected activities that involve coordination,
planning, and controlling products and services between suppliers and
customers. These actors within the supply chains need to coordinate
and collaborate. Because of the technological developments, especially
regarding information collecting, processing, and sharing, the adoption
of blockchain technology is relevant to address the supply chain op-
erations better and to meet the real needs of all the actors (Büyüközkan
& Göçer, 2018).


Most studies on blockchain technology have investigated its positive
effects in terms of transparency, accountability, coherent data sets, cost
reduction, and effective production processes in different contexts, such
as manufacturing, and mostly in supply chains, like agriculture, food,
and transport supply chains (Behnke & Janssen, 2019; Kamble,
Gunasekaran, Arha et al., 2019, 2019b; Pan et al., 2019; Thakur, Doja,
Dwivedi, Ahmad, & Khadanga, 2019; Wong et al., 2019). Blockchain
technology plays a relevant role especially within supply chains. It has
been conceived as a “concatenation of data combined into individual
blocks and stored on all of the users’ computers” (Tönnissen &
Teuteberg, 2019, p. 2). These specific data in blocks acquire the form of
chains thanks to their sequences as transactions. To include new re-
cords, the passage of a consensus mechanism (e.g. proof of work
whereby the computer executes a mathematical algorithm) is required
to obtain agreement among all of the partners in the supply chain (Beck
et al., 2017; Risius & Spohrer, 2017). In this way, the data will certainly
be the same in all nodes in the network (Swan, 2015).


Otherwise, SCM is an integrative approach to deal with the planning
and control of materials, operations, and information from suppliers toTa

end customers. Using blockchain technology to coordinate all the ele-
ments of the supply chain, from parts suppliers to retailers, achieves a
level of integration that represents a competitive advantage that is not
available in traditional logistics systems (Blome, Schoenherr, &
Eckstein, 2014).


In this context, SCM design performs and manages the operations of
resource flows (movements of products, people, information, and fi-
nance). In so doing, it facilitates the integration of various resources
across multiple organisations. Therefore, products, people, information,
and finances are resources that are integrated with other resources as
firms build and sell their offerings (Mallick et al., 2018). By connecting
all of these resources, SCM is always about servicing resource integra-
tion by managing flows on both the demand and the supply side. Re-
search on logistics service quality has underlined that customers care
about issues like product availability and condition, timeliness, the
quality of order-related information, interpersonal communication, and
the discrepancy-handling process. In this way, retailers or end-user
consumers are concerned about these elements, because having the
right products available when needed not only satisfies their own needs
but also is a precondition for servicing their customers further down-
stream. Hence, blockchain technology has been widely applied in sev-
eral supply chains related to finance, transport, power, and food/agri-
culture (Groenfeldt, 2017; Kshetri, 2018; O’Marah, 2017). These
applications have been successful in terms of ROI (Bünger, 2017),
especially considering the relevant transformations derived from
blockchain technology for supply chains. Indeed, the use of the IoT,
radio frequency identification (RFID) tags, sensors, barcodes, or GPS
tags and chips significantly affects SCM, such as in all activities related
to locating products and tracking packages and shipping containers
(Kshetri, 2018). Thanks to blockchain technology, it is now possible to
identify management (Alam, 2016), and all of the actors in the supply
chain are able to know which actions are being performed and who is
performing them by defining and recording the time and location of
these actions. Among the several benefits recognised for blockchain
technology, we can mention that it provides possible solutions for
identity management (Alam, 2016) and facilitates valid and effective
measurement of the outcomes and performance of key SCM processes
(Koetsier, 2017; Kshetri, 2018).


Scholars have investigated the impact of blockchain technology on
SCM in terms of strategic goals (Kshetri, 2018) or considered the ac-
ceptance of blockchain technology considering country differences
(Queiroz & Fosso Wamba, 2019). They have also demonstrated that the
trust between members in SCM means that institutional intermediaries
do not need to be involved (Ying et al., 2018). Only a few scholars have
also investigated the link between blockchain technology and sustain-
able development goals (SDGs) and looked for evidence regarding how
blockchain technology could present significant benefits in meeting the
UN SDGs (Hughes et al., 2019). Furthermore, scholars have explored
how blockchain technology can significantly transform supply chains,
because the secure exchange of data in a distributed manner can affect
the structure and governance of supply chains as well as the config-
urations of relationships and information sharing between actors in the
chains (Wang, Singgih et al., 2019).


However, blockchain technology has positive and negative effects
on the overall business world (Aste et al., 2017; Giungato et al., 2017;
Kewell et al., 2017; Kshetri, 2018; Lu & Xu, 2017; Vranken, 2017).
Thanks to blockchain technology, it should be possible to achieve the
traditional objectives of the supply chain, which are to improve the
cost, quality, speed, dependability, risk reduction, sustainability, and
flexibility (Baird & Thomas, 1991; Bettis & Mahajan, 1985; Bowen,
Cousins, Lamming, & Faruk, 2001; Goldbach, Seuring, & Back, 2003;
Kovács, 2004; Meyer & Hohmann, 2000; Rao & Holt, 2005; White,
1996). Indeed, in supply chains, logistics services are often crucial for
enabling firms to deliver customer value (Mentzer, Flint, & Hult, 2001).
Otherwise, the main goal to achieve within SCM consists of delivering
products and services in the right condition, in a timely manner, and


with the lowest possible costs while reducing the risks (Flint, 2004;
Kshetri, 2018). Blockchain technology can allow a great advancement
in the authentication and validation of supply chains, although tradi-
tional quality and auditing processes are needed at each step to creating
a transactional record. Thus, blockchain technology provides major and
significant advances for effective supply chains, but there is still a need
for quality audits (Apte and Petrovsky, 2016). With blockchain tech-
nology, the process is faster and the transactional records become more
robust and reliable (Apte and Petrovsky, 2016; Kshetri, 2018).


In summary, blockchain technology can add significant value to
supply chains (Wang, Singgih et al., 2019). Academic contributions to
the link between blockchain technology and supply chains are still
scarce, since they only started in 2015. Blockchain technology can
enable transactions offering transparency, authenticity, visibility, trust,
and security to all the participants in a supply chain. For instance, due
to real-time tracking, it is possible to know exactly where a product is
and when it can be delivered, and all the firms within a supply chain
can have and share the same data and information (Kim & Laskowski,
2016; Loop, 2017; MH&L, 2016). In addition, blockchain technology
has made it possible to improve efficiency in supply chains (Bedell,
2016; MH&L, 2016) as well as to reduce waste, costs, and the time that
the products are in the transit process (Barnard, 2017; Kharif, 2016;
Loop, 2017). Indeed, blockchain technology speeds up the transfer of
data. This allows the participating firms to be informed in real time and
products to spend less time in transit. This provides opportunities to
improve inventory management and to reduce the related costs and
waste.


3.1. Blockchain technology applications in the airport industry: the A-CDM


One of the numerous supply chains involved in the positive effects
of blockchain technology applications is represented by the transport
industry, especially the airport industry (Akmeemana, 2017; Álvarez-
Díaz, Herrera-Joancomartí, & Caballero-Gil, 2017).


During the last two decades, the airport sector has been experien-
cing relevant changes as it has been significantly affected by the advent
of blockchain technology, taking into account the main implications
derived from establishing the operational standards of service perfor-
mance in the airport industry, in which a very broad revolution is
taking place due to the development and adoption of new technologies.
Otherwise, blockchain technology within the airport setting, as well as
in other crucial service contexts, significantly affects the overall ser-
vices provided by making them more satisfying and highly standardised
according to the main mission and vision of the airport industry, which
provides high-standard operational services that respond strictly to
passengers’ collective attitudes and needs. Since the 1980s, most air-
ports have aimed to maximise user satisfaction by providing higher
service levels (Bottasso & Conti, 2012; Caplice & Sheffi, 1995; Park &
Park, 1994). The critical performance indicators for airport planning,
design, and management concern the service levels and operational
standards that are specifically based on the queuing time, service pro-
cessing time, space requirement per passenger, and so forth (Park,
1989).


With the advent and spread of blockchain technology, increasing
attention has been paid to the concepts of the service level and op-
erational standards in the airport industry. The main factors considered
have been the temporal and spatial conditions. This is in line with the
dominant service logic, which requires specific interventions in terms of
design or physical standards and operational standards that are able to
affect passenger perceptions. Hence, most airports should update their
operational standards based on passenger perceptions and needs to
provide more satisfying services (Bottasso & Conti, 2012; Caplice &
Sheffi, 1995; Park & Park, 1994). Airports have been conceived as
multi-product firms that are able to supply the market through a broad
package of services (Bottasso & Conti, 2012; Office of Fair Trading
(OFT), 2006).


A. Di Vaio and L. Varriale










In this scenario, especially by implementing blockchain technology
applications, airports are changing the ways in which they perform by
taking into account some different issues, such as sustainability, espe-
cially environmental and economic sustainability, always in relation to
the service pattern. The recent advances in technology, regarding
communications, navigation, and surveillance, have created the con-
ditions for an architecture in which all of the players that are directly
and indirectly involved in the airport industry and in SCM have re-
sponsibilities and perform their specific operations through the A-CDM
system (Ball, Chen, Hoffman, & Vossen, 2001). Among the numerous
blockchain technology applications within the airport supply chain
(maintenance, passenger and crew identity management, ticketing,
loyalty, security, ancillary revenue and in-flight entertainment, luggage
chain of custody, air cargo, customs clearing, flight planning, smart
contracts, and compensation), A-CDM plays a crucial role and sig-
nificantly influences the effectiveness and efficiency of SCM.


A-CDM based on AI represents a joint government industry initiative
that addresses the improvement of the traffic flow management aspect
of air traffic management through an increase in information exchange
and an improvement in decision support tools (Chang et al., 2001;
Groppe, Pagliari, & Harris, 2009; Hoffman, 2001). A-CDM was created
and developed in 1991, when the Federal Aviation Administration’s
(FAA’s) Air Traffic Management office required an investigation to
measure the effects of the airlines’ flight substitution process on the
efficacy of ground delay programmes (GDPs). These experiments
showed that enabling airlines to submit real-time operational in-
formation to the Air Traffic Management Office could improve air
traffic management decision making.


The main problem for the airline companies is represented by op-
erations management in the relation between flight arrival delays
(FADs) and flight departure delays (FDDs). Considering that the flights
are carried out by aircraft that have already been used in previous
flights, an arrival delay and the aircraft turnaround time at the airport
are not enough to represent a great issue for the airline companies.
Therefore, the companies entrust the disruption management process to
the Airline Operations Control Centre (AOCC). Castro and Oliveira
(2010) identified the main causes of disruption. Some are due to air
navigation (e.g., en-route air traffic, en-route weather, en-route aircraft
malfunction, and flight diversion). Others are due to the OM by the
airport operators (e.g., crew delays, cargo/baggage loading delays and
passenger delays, crew members who do not report for duty, air traffic
control reasons, air craft malfunctions, and weather conditions on de-
parture or arrival). From the airport perspective, to manage some of the
causes of disruption ascribed to the airport operations, A-CDM re-
presents a significant system for improving air traffic management
through information exchange, procedural improvements, tool devel-
opment, and common situational awareness. Thanks to A-CDM, the
traffic flows and the associated resource allocation decisions are man-
aged and recognised as a great responsibility of the AOCC. This system
works through two main principles: information and data sharing and
distributed decision making. With the adoption of new business models
and especially innovative technologies, A-CDM aims to achieve the
following goals: to generate better information, due to the merger be-
tween flight data and information on airspace users; to create major and
common awareness through information sharing for both traffic man-
agers and airspace users; and to create tools and procedures that are
able to respond quickly and efficiently to possible capacity/demand
imbalances.1


According to most operators, the A-CDM implementation manual was
designed and introduced to facilitate the harmonised implementation of


A-CDM at European airports. In 2017, the Implementation manual was
introduced as guideline for all users. It explained all of the steps re-
quired for successful implementation and operation. For instance, de-
tails were provided regarding the timing schedules for management
decisions in organising an A-CDM project. The A-CDM implementation
manual represents a very relevant tool for all of the players, aircraft
operators, air traffic services, airport operations, ground handlers,
service providers, and any other partners. It provides important in-
formation for decision makers as well as technical and operational ex-
perts. The A-CDM implementation manual, in its structure and content,
considers all of the partners and addresses the common goals of globally
improving the air transport infrastructure and achieving the greatest
possible efficiency of the air SSSM. To achieve these goals, specific
information and data are required with respect to the needs of all the
partners and the final customers (passengers). A-CDM is embedded in
the air traffic management (ATM) operational concept. Thus, its im-
plementation requires the adoption of technologies and new managerial
solutions for improving operational efficiency, predictability, and
punctuality by the ATM network and airport stakeholders. A-CDM has a
significant impact on the operating efficiency of airport partners and
should contribute to reducing the buffer times for resource planning
and flight times due to enhanced predictability. The implementation of
A-CDM can lead to numerous changes in communication policies and
procedures as well as the overall operations management in SSCM.
Scholars and practitioners have usually described A-CDM as something
that is easily related to better information sharing. It can be viewed as
one revolutionary system for making the SSCM in the airport industry
more efficient thanks to the adoption of new technologies and with
respect to the standards of sustainable performance (Okwir & Correas,
2014).


The new technologies in blockchain applications as well as A-CDM
enable airports to automate as much as possible to increase the in-
formation flow and create digitised service. Many effective and efficient
solutions can be adopted by airports to make their performance more
sustainable. For instance, easier delivery of information to passengers,
airlines, personnel, and other users by having more information on the
airport system will add value, and the passengers and other partners
can provide the airport with more information. As already outlined,
most airports and airport authorities should update their operational
standards by taking into account the passengers’ perceptions and thus
by providing more comprehensive service levels to maximise their sa-
tisfaction (Chang et al., 2001; Groppe et al., 2009; Hoffman, 2001).


3.2. Effects and sustainability


Blockchain technology, which is the base for a distributed and de-
mocratically sustained public ledger of transactions, could foster new
and challenging opportunities. Especially, blockchain technology solu-
tions can be effective tools for achieving the sustainable development
goals (SDGs) agenda introduced by the United Nations (UN) in 2015 in
any country worldwide and in any economic setting, especially within
supply chains (Giungato et al., 2017; Hughes et al., 2019; Kewell et al.,
2017; Saberi et al., 2018, 2019; Vranken, 2017). Otherwise, Kranzberg
argued that “technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral”
(Kranzberg, 1986, p. 545), reminding us of the moral and ethical fea-
tures related to innovations. Research has mostly focused its attention
on the technical characteristics, efficiency gains, and profits linked to
blockchain technology projects, experimental distributed ledger tech-
nologies (DLTs) (Kewell et al., 2017; McWaters, Galaski, & Chaterjee,
2016; Ng, 2013; Potts, Davidson, & De Filippi, 2016; Swan, 2015;
Walport, 2016), as well as the commercial and consumer benefits
drawn from blockchain innovation. Meanwhile, less attention has been
paid to social and environmental effects and other implications of
blockchain technology applications (CPTM, 2016; Kewell et al., 2017).
Blockchain technology has been recognised as a promising catalyst to
meet the SDG targets (Babcock, 2015; Giungato et al., 2017; Kewell

et al., 2017; Xia, Zhou, & Peng, 2017; Yan & Zhang, 2016). For instance,
thanks to blockchain technology, it should be possible to build a smart
city by developing shared economic services (Yan & Zhang, 2016) or to
improve the quality of life (QoL) as well as the quality of services (QoS)
by making cities smarter and by creating a smart environment in which,
by collecting a large amount of data from several sources, the social and
environmental aspects of citizens’ needs can be satisfied (Pieroni,
Scarpato, Di Nunzio, Fallucchi, & Raso, 2018). Indeed, some features
related to security, like confidentiality, availability, and integrity, are
necessary for implementing trust-free sharing services in a smart city,
and we can find these elements as fundamentals in blockchain-based
technology. Blockchain technology, as already outlined, represents a
decentralised protocol whereby all information is completely confi-
dential and third parties cannot access the data. Moreover, Faber and
Hadders (2016) demonstrated that blockchain technology potentially
creates an infrastructure to implement “new social contracts for sus-
tainability”, promoting the transition to sustainable development
without requiring centralised functions for connections and relation-
ships between individuals. Hence, blockchain technology extends be-
yond the current business model, which is mainly managed by old
mainstream bureaucratic and power institutions (political parties,
banks, local governments, etc.), and it can be applied in the decen-
tralisation of the entire system.


It is possible to identify three main elements of blockchain tech-
nology performance in economic systems: horizontal integration in
value creation networks; vertical and network integration of manu-
facturing systems; and end-to-end engineering during product life cy-
cles.


Blockchain technology provides companies with a new way of de-
signing their SCM, which can allow them to satisfy new customer re-
quirements and face challenges on the supply side and fulfil other ex-
pectations in efficiency improvement (Pfohl, Yahsi, & Kurnaz, 2015).
This new supply chain has the potential to be faster, more accurate,
more granular, and more efficient. As a matter of fact, the delivery time
can be reduced by up to a few hours, and real-time, end-to-end trans-
parency is provided throughout the supply chain. Mass customisation
may be realised thanks to the management of customers in granular
groups. This allows suppliers to offer more appropriate products; the
automation of both physical tasks and planning increases efficiency.


To bridge the gap in the implementation of blockchain technologies
within supply chains (Giungato et al., 2017; Kewell et al., 2017;
Tjahjono et al., 2017), the areas that are the most affected by the in-
troduction of blockchain technology are the fulfilment of orders and the
logistics of transport. Nevertheless, some technologies can translate into
both threats and opportunities. The reason for this is that all of the
different areas are interrelated, without clear boundaries between
them, and, depending on where the analysis occurs, this could have
negative or positive implications. The new technologies are able to
introduce organisational and technical improvements and advantages.
Moreover, the same technologies are able to contribute in several ways
to the performance of production processes (Lee, Kao, & Yang, 2014).
The difficulties that present obstacles to the implementation of block-
chain technology solutions are the lack of highly skilled labour that is
capable of developing algorithms (enabling self-learning intelligence)
and the high cost of implementing of these technologies (Tortorella &
Fettermann, 2017).


The advent and spread of blockchain technology is leading to new
levels of demand from customers. This is increasing the need for pro-
ductive systems to provide adept responses. In the future, blockchain
technology will also play a crucial role by contributing significantly to
the development of the business world and the global community to-
wards more “sustainable” industrial value creation (Giungato et al.,
2017; Hughes et al., 2019; Kamble, Gunasekaran, & Arha, 2018; Kewell
et al., 2017; Saberi et al., 2018, 2019; Stock & Seliger, 2016). In the
existing research and practice, sustainability has been characterised by
three principal components, specifically social, economic, and


environmental dimensions (Glavič & Lukman, 2007; Quak & De Koster,
2007). These are named the “triple bottom line” for sustainability de-
velopment, which emerged in the early 1980s (Bebbington & Unerman,
2018; Elkington, 1994). The social dimension concerns the need for a
reduction of any negative impacts from industrial activities. The eco-
nomic dimension focuses on the efficiency of business operations,
creating a balance between the use of resources for manufacturing
products and the offering of services to people. The environmental di-
mension pays attention to future generations through the preservation
and protection of natural resources. In the existing literature on
blockchain technology, the economic and environmental dimensions
represent the major dimensions of sustainability considered (Kamble
et al., 2018; Saberi et al., 2018). Therefore, another challenge for
blockchain technology is to respect environmental sustainability
(Bonilla, Silva, Terra da Silva, Franco Gonçalves, & Sacomano, 2018).
In particular, the requirement of adopting renewable energy systems
must be met.


Environmental sustainability frames production within specific
limits. Exploitation should not exceed regeneration, waste generation
should not exceed the assimilation allowed by the biosphere, and de-
pleted non-renewable resources should be replaced by substitutes
(Fettermann, Sá Cavalcante, de Almeida, & Tortorella, 2018). The sa-
tisfaction of these requirements by blockchain technology is necessary
to achieve sustainability.


According to the literature, sustainable development could be ex-
pected through new business models and new processes (Tsvetkova,
2017). In general, digital technologies could integrate renewable en-
ergy sources. However, factors such as the quantity of materials used,
primary energy consumption, and working conditions will affect this
development negatively. Furthermore, the ways of collecting and
sharing information and data will play a key role. If companies manage
and improve their social, economic, and environmental performance in
the supply chain, they can avoid waste, optimise processes, discover
new product innovations, reduce costs, and increase productivity.


In addition, blockchain technologies could increase inequality and
further exclude the disenfranchised. The contribution of policy makers
will be decisive. They have to be aware of the changes resulting from
the implementation of digital technologies and thus act accordingly to
avoid infringing on social and economic rights (Bocken, Short, Rana, &
Evans, 2014). The powerful analytical capabilities of digital technolo-
gies can be an asset for policy makers in this regard and can help in the
prioritisation of sustainable development goals in the new scenario
created by blockchain technology.


Although numerous studies have provided a clear reading of the
blockchain technology era, demonstrating its main characteristics,
functions, and implications, its practical application through a specific
procedure is still unclear and underdeveloped (Fettermann et al.,
2018), especially concerning how the overall blockchain technology
can affect operations management (OM) (Almada-Lobo, 2016) and
particularly considering some specific organisational settings, like the
airport industry.


Blockchain technology requires the operations to be redesigned and
reorganised by adapting the technology and management to a different
level of operating systems and tools that are able to create the potential
value for the activities (Saucedo-Martìnez, Pèrez-Lara, Marmolejo-
Saucedo, Salais-Fierro, & Vasant, 2017). In this direction, organisa-
tional change is necessary and involves all of the resources within firms
(human, financial, and technical resources) by applying new techniques
that are able to generate value by providing market stability. For in-
stance, the integration of business operations represents an important
practice that allows business activities to improve along the entire value
chain (Neeraja, Mehta, & Chandani, 2004).


Although research on the link between OM and sustainable per-
formance has recognised the relevant role of blockchain technology in
affecting OM for sustainable performance, these studies are still scarce,
especially within SCM from the perspective of SSCM and most

especially in the airport industry.


4. Case study


In the Italian airport industry, a different organisational model has
recently been adopted (D.P.R. n. 201/2015), which consists of a new
frame for redesigning the overall airport system. Strategic airports, as
compared with airports with national interest, have been identified and
categorised while taking into account specific roles and functions in
terms of their performance standards and their presence in the
European core network.2 According to the transport regulations in Italy
(Codice della Navigazione, 2018, art. 698 – Code of Navigation in
Italy), it is possible to distinguish and identify airports and airport
systems of national interest. These are recognised as essential nodes for
enabling the Italian State to exercise exclusive powers. They are iden-
tified by looking at the size and the type of traffic, the territorial lo-
cation, and the strategic role of these airports as well as the standards
reported by the European TEN projects. In accordance with the reg-
ulations within the European Union (EU) regarding the Trans-European
Transport Network (TEN-T network, Regulations No. 1315 and 1316/
2013), the Italian rule system recognises the special relevance of air-
ports that are “core nodes” of the TEN-T network.


Starting from this brief description of Italian airports’ organisational
set-up, the case of the Naples airport system has been deeply in-
vestigated and has provided useful information through a case study
description of how blockchain technology can significantly affect SCM,
focusing the attention on the operations management.


The airport of Naples, called Napoli-Capodichino, is an infra-
structure managed by GE.S.A.C. S.p.A. (Gestione Servizi Aeroporti
Campani). This is a concessionaire established in 1980 with a share-
holding that is mainly composed of private operators: Aeroporti SPA
(private shareholder) owns 87% of the shares, Città Metropolitana di
Napoli (public shareholder) owns 12.5% of the shares, and finally the
Municipality of Naples (public shareholder) owns 0.5% of the shares.
According to the last statistical report published by ASSAEROPORTI,
which is the Italian airport association, in 2018, Napoli-Capodichino
managed about 9,932,029 passengers, ranking among the main Italian
and European airports (retrieved on 15 January 2019 from https://
www.assaeroporti.com/statistiche_201812/).


The services provided by Napoli-Capodichino are not limited to
ensuring assistance services for the embarkation, disembarkation, and
transit of passengers and their luggage but also guarantee the security
and safety services and all the other services that are useful for pas-
sengers in each step of their trip. These steps include the services in the
area outside the airport infrastructure (e.g., parking, taxis, shuttles, and
so forth); services within the airport infrastructure but outside the
check area (e.g., duty free, restaurants, coffee point, toilets, shops,
customer services, check-in desk, information point, emergency room,
digital arrival and departure time schedule, and so on); and services in
the infrastructure between the check area and the embarkation area
(e.g., duty free, restaurants, typical local cuisine, street art tour, WiFi
Express, restricted areas, BenBo to sleep in the airport, FastTrack, gifts,
shops, e-shops, and so forth). All the services provided are organised
into activities including more and more operations that involve nu-
merous players.


According to the regulations and the legal procedures, especially the
legislative decree no. 151/2006, there are strict rules that apply to the
roles and responsibilities among the public and private players in the
operations that characterise the SCM in the airport. Indeed, following
the legislative decree, the airport concessionaire is responsible for the


safety and security of airport functions and operations and, above all,
its functions and powers of coordination for the whole system.
Specifically, the concessionaire is charged with the technical and op-
erative coordination and control of all the private players operating in
the infrastructure.


Principally, it is necessary to ensure the time coincidence between
two or more flights in the international spaces, because Napoli-
Capodichino airport is the fifth player of EUROCONTROL, as the
Network Manager, that is, the airport network nominated by the
European Commission from July 2011 until 31 December 2019. Its
mission is to contribute to the delivery of air traffic management (ATM)
performance in the pan-European network in the areas of safety, ca-
pacity, environmental and flight efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.
Thus, the Network Manager’s priority in the European ATM network is
to forge operational partnerships and to foster cooperative decision
making. Both of these are needed to achieve the performance targets in
a transparent and impartial way. Indeed, the effectiveness and effi-
ciency of the operations management represent a critical factor of the
airport services bundle (Tsiotsou & Wirtz, 2015).


In this direction, Napoli-Capodichino has implemented A-CDM to
reduce the main inefficiencies in the airport’s management as well as to
optimise the airport infrastructure using all the available data. The lack
of a full picture of the processes and operations related to flights that
involve more airports influences the planning and, consequently, the
performance in terms of sustainability.


The A-CDM project represents a transition in the “turnaround”
management operational methodology from “first come, first served” to
“first ready, first served”. It is an integrated platform that transfers
information on the status of all departing flights in real time to the
EUROCONTROL Management Operations Centre, which, in turn,
transmits this information to other partner airports. In this manner, it is
possible to optimise the air traffic flow, the airport capacity manage-
ment, and the use of airport infrastructure and human resources in
addition to increasing flight punctuality, reducing fuel consumption
and its related environmental impact, and improving airport efficiency,
punctuality, and the predictability of events. The digitalisation of op-
erations is standardised along with communication among the players
involved to reduce any possible error source. In this programme, based
on an information exchange platform, all flight phases, from departure
to landing, are considered as a “single process”, which ensures the
optimisation of air traffic management and ground handling operations.


The advantages of A-CDM, due to sharing and predicting the aircraft
readiness time, allow the airport to plan earlier departure sequences, to
manage runways and taxiways better, and to reduce the fuel usage
because of aircraft holding on standby. The airports also have more
time to resolve gate conflicts and thus improve the passenger experi-
ence. Finally, the ground handlers are able to deploy their resources
more efficiently.


The current situation at airports shows that numerous separated and
untrusting parties still exist that are not able to come together to
achieve the common goals of ensuring that the aircraft are landed,
turned around, and airborne again within the constraints of realistic
turnaround times, weather events, and above all safety. Because of the
involvement of many different organisations and systems, the main
topic is to break down silos and share information. This would establish
perfect grounds for a consortium blockchain, whereby each party would
participate in the chain and each party would be able to see a real
picture of what is happening in nearly real time at another airport.
Consequently, the decision-making process would not happen in iso-
lation. This would result in fewer delays and potentially highlight areas
that regularly cause delays (retrieved on 25 March 2019 from https://
medium.com/@akme_c/blockchain-platform-ideas-that-will-enable-
the-airline-industry-80b1eaeb9b56). In this way, decisions and actions
could be adopted to solve the business issues for operations manage-
ment linked to flight delays.


To plan pre-departure sequences, one of ACDM’s primary

are managed through the concessionaire agreement; that is, specific organisa-
tions, named concessionaires, which are usually private, plan and manage the
airport infrastructures.

requirements is to define the “target take-off time” (TTOT) in the most
accurate possible manner to improve the “en route” and “sector”
planning on the part of the European ATM. This objective may be ob-
tained by implementing a series of DPI (departure planning informa-
tion) messages and “FUMs” (flight update messages), which are then
sent to the NMOC (network manager operations centre).


In other words, A-CDM represents a change of operating metho-
dology in the management of the “turnaround” from “first come, first
served” to “first ready, first served”. One of the main objectives of A-
CDM is to evaluate the target take-off time (TTOT) in the most accurate
way as well as to know in real time the traffic for the “en route” and
“sector” European management (ATM). This objective is attainable
through the implementation of a series of “DPI” (departure planning
information) messages and “FUMs” (flight update messages) sent to the
central flow management unit (CFMU). The CDM airport can be con-
sidered to be the basis for the connection of the single airport to the
ATM system (Fig. 2).


In this manner, airport CDM procedures may be considered to be a
basis for linking the airport and the ATM system. The A-CDM procedure
was implemented through the introduction of processes based on the
following five elements: the milestones approach (turnaround process),
variable taxi time (VTT), collaborative pre-departure sequence, CDM in
adverse weather conditions, and collaborative management of flight
updates. A-CDM procedures begin with the transmission of ATC flight
plans three hours prior to the EOBT (estimated off block time) and
continue through sixteen milestones that describe the flight status in all
of its phases prior to take-off (ATOT – actual take-off time).


There is much emphasis on the application of algorithms. These are
a series of instructions, like a flowchart, which can be followed to solve
a specific problem. Although not a “technology” per se, they can be
found in activities such as the scheduling of departing aircraft to avoid
heavy aircraft jet engine thrust adversely affecting smaller aircraft be-
hind them (algorithms are particularly appropriate for that sort of ac-
tivity) and baggage handling.


This condition is relevant to tackle airport congestion both on the
runway and at the gate to respond to the passengers’ needs. Therefore,
the A-CDM programme for the control of arrival and departure waves at
major hub airports is an obvious application.


Blockchain technology is particularly adept at the integration of
information between different players in providing passengers with a
seamless journey through an airport. This process involves the airport,


airline, ground handling company, and one or more IT supplier ser-
vices, so, if something goes wrong involving one or more of those
players, the passengers can be apprised of the situation and of their
alternatives immediately (as long as they have the right tools). At the
same time, it is ensured that all of those players are updated simulta-
neously. All of this process still conforms perfectly to what A-CDM
hopes to achieve for the players and ultimately the customers.
Blockchain technology allows airports to promote and realise the in-
tegration of information and data (retrieved on 24 March 2019 from
https://centreforaviation.com/analysis/airline-leader/airport-
technology–what-passengers-want-greater-personal-control-of-the-
airport-process-395194).


5. Findings and discussion


A-CDM promotes the cooperation between the main players of the
aviation industry, such as airlines, airport operations (airport operators
and ground handlers), and air traffic controllers (ATCs) to reduce
fragmentation, inefficiency, and uncoordinated operations (Fig. 3).


The platform allows the Napoli-Capodichino airport to connect with
the ENAV, that is, the Italian air navigation service provider, and ex-
change all of the information related to the flights. In this way, it is
possible to send the information in real time to the network manager
operations centre through EUROCONTROL. The adoption of the digital
integrated system also increases flights’ punctuality, thereby reducing
their fuel consumption and negative environmental effects. Thanks to
A-CDM, all the phases of a flight, from the flight plan to the airport
operation and from take-off to the flight route until the next landing,
are considered to be a “single process” that connects the flights, starting
with the incoming one. It allows for the optimisation of air traffic
management (ATM) and all the assistance operations through the
constant exchange of information, updated in real time, among the
operators involved. In terms of airport operations, the platform opti-
mises the use of the infrastructure thanks to all the information being
available in real time. It also reduces congestion as well as concerns
about ground handling. The platform promotes the reduction of
movement costs and optimises the use of ground handling resources.
Regarding air traffic control (ATC), the platform allows flexible pre-
departure planning, reduces slot wastage, and thus reduces taxiway
congestion. With regard to the central flow management unit (CFMU),
it improves the predictability related to the process and provides real-

time updates to the network. Finally, concerning the effects for the
airlines, the platform allows the improvement of on-time performance
to obtain faster turnaround.


A-CDM allows the management of the information flow among
more partners, focusing on and linking three big activities of the pro-
cess: inbound (arrival), turnaround, and outbound (departure).


In these three phases, information about the “taxi times” needs to be
included to obtain an accurate block prediction to start the turnaround
process and a take-off prediction for the network. Considering that the
default taxi times can often be inaccurate, the airport partners have to
be involved. However, the adoption of A-CDM by Napoli-Capodichino
does not seem to be the right solution in adverse conditions. Indeed, the
disruption in adverse conditions consists mainly of a major reduction in
capacity and slow recovery due to missing information, communica-
tion, and prioritisation.


This problem could be due to the characteristics of blockchain
technology, which requires operators to rethink, redesign, and remodel
all the operations to be able to manage the different levels of the op-
erating systems (Saucedo-Martínez, Pérez-Lara, Marmolejo-Saucedo,
Salais-Fierro, & Vasant, 2018). Indeed, improving the management of
disruptions is always not easy, because it also requires the standardi-
sation of the disruption management process (Kleindorfer & Saad,
2005).


Although previous studies on the adoption of blockchain technology
have highlighted its benefits in overcoming trust-related issues (Glaser,
2017), on the other side, it does not seem to eliminate the need for trust
between partners in sharing data and information (Hawlitschek,
Notheisen, & Teubner, 2018). Besides, the usefulness of A-CDM has
been read as a response to the need for sustainability performance for
an airport, as highlighted by the non-financial disclosure.


For instance, in 2017, the Naples airport non-financial report stated
that, since 2016, A-CDM had been introduced as an integrated platform
with the specific function to collect, manage, and share information in


real time by connecting all the airports (for more details, see the
Appendix).


Both sentences allow us to see that the airport of Naples shows a
collaborative orientation with the overall airport networks and the local
territory, in which the adoption of a specific integrated platform and of
a proactive strategy that is also focused on the local economy is able to
achieve two objectives through reporting practices. The first objective is
to help all of the airports to share crucial information about the flights
and use the infrastructures with relevant positive effects in terms of
sustainability. The second is to create synergies with local institutions
that make and adopt decisions that are strategically relevant to the
development of the entire community and territory.


Thus, this airport tends to line up with other airports, such as
Munich, Brussels, and Paris-Charles de Gaulle, which had already in-
troduced A-CDM in 2011 to optimise the interactions between more
organisations, leading to better punctuality for all flights (Graham,
2016).


In this case, the airport’s sustainable performance has been achieved
through collaboration and integration between all of the players by
strengthening global partnerships in the direction of the 2030 Agenda.
We can interpret this result in relation to the 17 SDGs and through an
integrated strategy by promoting the territory as well as from the per-
spective of inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable cities and local
communities, in which the 11 SDGs can be represented.


6. Theoretical and managerial implications


Adopting blockchain technology to improve the efficiency, effec-
tiveness, and sustainability of processes requires the involvement of all
stakeholders. Indeed, in some industries, as well as in the airport set-
ting, technological disruptions require the planning and complete
standardisation of the processes of technologies’ crisis management.
This means that the A-CDM partners and the A-CDM stakeholders (e.g.

A. Di Vaio and L. Varriale







https://www.capgemini.com/gb-en/




aircraft operators, airport operators, etc.) should also implement the A-
CDM culture in the network, because the platform is a tool that involves
people as well as passengers.


These findings allow us mainly to confirm the few existing studies in
the literature on blockchain technology applied in the airport industry
with A-CDM within SCM (Corrigan et al., 2015; Katsaros & Psaraki-
Kalouptsidi, 2011; Nadeem, 2018; Okwir & Correas, 2014; Robinson,
2017; Santonino, Koursaris, & Williams, 2018; Vojtek & Smudja, 2019).
Specifically, most authors who have investigated A-CDM have found
that there was a need to adopt a participative approach to make it more
effective and successful and to prevent and manage the possible dis-
ruptive and transformative processes for OM. This was achieved
through the involvement of all of the partners and the employees within
SCM to increase their trust (Corrigan et al., 2015; Katsaros & Psaraki-
Kalouptsidi, 2011; Okwir & Correas, 2014; Robinson, 2017). Some
authors have already outlined the relevance of a trust climate within
SCM for making blockchain technology effective and successful in any
industry; indeed, because of the trust between players in SCM, the co-
operation is supported by knowledge and information sharing (Pan
et al., 2019).


A-CDM was analysed here as one useful blockchain technology ap-
plication within the airport supply chain that significantly optimises the
airport operational efficiency (Katsaros & Psaraki-Kalouptsidi, 2011).
As already outlined, although studies have investigated A-CDM and in
general the blockchain technology in the airport industry and pointed
out the main advantages and negative effects, they have still not paid
attention to the link between blockchain technology and OM within
SCM from the perspective of sustainable performance.


Otherwise, the benefits of adopting blockchain technology have
been observed. In the airport industry, thanks to A-CDM, airports are
better able to address punctuality, but the current digital system does
not include other processes and activities in which “internal” and “ex-
ternal” human resources are involved (e.g., airport equipment and
passengers). Indeed, taking into account all of the human resources in
the context of their active involvement and commitment can contribute
to the effectiveness and efficiency of the services through the digital
transformation process witnessed by A-CDM.


This study should be a useful guide for managers, especially supply
chain managers within the airport industry, to rethink, redesign, and
remodel the organisational process and to introduce and promote
training and educational programmes for employees that are not simply
focused on using A-CDM but that aim to develop and stimulate the
cultural change in the digitalisation era. In this way, the disruptions
from technology can be managed through the involvement of all in-
dividuals in the process. Besides, involving the passengers, thanks to
direct interactions in the process, could support the knowledge and the
management of A-CDM from the customer perspective.


The results of this case study contribute to the existing literature on
blockchain technology in several ways. The study does not easily show
evidence of the advantages and disadvantages of the innovation, but it
highlights some issues that remain underinvestigated, such us the co-
operation between players in a supply chain (e.g. airports) linked to
blockchain technology, the disruption issues, the cultural approach, and
the role of trust conveyed by the digital transformation of the opera-
tions. In general, as already outlined by previous studies, blockchain
technology is automatically able to build a trust system for im-
plementing value exchange and improving firms’ performance (Behnke
& Janssen, 2019; Pan et al., 2019). Indeed, the implementation of
blockchain technology can effectively manage and solve the informa-
tion asymmetry among the partners in any supply chain (Pan et al.,
2019).


Therefore, the aviation industry, especially airports, can be an em-
pirical setting to investigate further while also considering the strong
orientation towards sustainable development (SD), especially the sus-
tainable development goals (SDGs) (Chang & Yeh, 2016). Thus, to make
A-CDM among blockchain technology applications more effective for


sustainable performance, the technology disruption management must
be entrusted to the organisational dimension of the partners involved in
A-CDM by sharing the information, the activities, and the operations of
the disruption management processes. From this perspective, the main
operators of the aviation industry discussed here should pay more at-
tention to the needs not only of the operators involved in the business-
to-business (B2B) supply chain but also of those in the business-to-
consumer (B2C) segment in the SDGs’ logical theoretical framework.


In summary, from the case study presented above, it is possible to
derive some interesting implications as described. Our study provides
new insights into how blockchain technology can significantly and
positively influence OM in SCM for sustainable performance through a
different model to analyse these issues. Indeed, we examine these topics
differently, and it is not easy to find evidence for the main benefits and
challenges involved in adopting blockchain technology in SCM (Hughes
et al., 2019; Kshetri, 2018; Queiroz & Fosso Wamba, 2019), but we
propose different instruments, such as organisational, managerial, and
reporting tools, for investigating blockchain technology for SSCM.


7. Conclusions


The aim of our research was to explore blockchain technology in the
airport industry from the perspective of sustainable performance. The
primary findings show that Napoli-Capodichino is significantly affected
by new technologies, especially the adoption of the A-CDM system,
which has been recognised as a relevant blockchain technology appli-
cation. This platform, adopting AI in airports, allows, although par-
tially, the management of disruptions that are due to external and in-
ternal causes and thereby improves the efficiency, effectiveness, and
sustainable performance of the overall air transport process.


Although our research offers interesting insights, the nature of the
study was explorative and suffered from a few limitations. We con-
sidered only one airport in our empirical analysis, and we focused only
on the analysis of documents and other sources of information and data.
Some scholars have recognised that blockchain technology allows users
to overcome all of the problems related to disclosure and accountability
(Casey & Wong, 2017), but today the impact that blockchain tech-
nology applications have on the business models in SCM is still unclear
(Tönnissen & Teuteberg, 2019).


However, the findings of our study seem to show that there is not
yet a procedure at this airport to manage the A-CDM disruptions,
especially if the technological disruptions involve multiple airline
companies and airports. Through a critical analysis of documents, each
decision that concerns technological disruption management that has
an impact on the operations must be included in a standardised process
called “A-CDM disruption management”. Besides, the role of the human
resources in the technological disruption management is not mentioned
in any of the sources that we used to conduct this study from the per-
spective of the negative effects of blockchain technology on sustainable
performance. These results highlight that strategic industries, such as
airports, are still under-researched in terms of managing blockchain
technology effectively, efficiently, socially, and environmentally
(Queiroz & Fosso Wamba, 2019; Wang, Singgih et al., 2019). Therefore,
on one side, all the advantages linked to blockchain technology appli-
cations can support the decision-making processes of all the players
involved. On the other side, they can represent some threats with
consequent financial losses and lacking sustainable performance in
SCM.


These findings also allow us to think about further questions to
investigate. Does the airport industry think about the positive effects of
blockchain technology? Are airports and other players in the supply
chain aware of the impact of blockchain technology and of the sus-
tainability issue? What do airports offer to their passengers supported
by blockchain technology? What is the opinion of supply chain man-
agers, employees, and passengers in the airport industry about block-
chain technology adoption?


A. Di Vaio and L. Varriale






However, the results provide an interesting contribution to the ex-
isting literature on the issues analysed and make some advancements in
the current scientific research. Besides, they could contribute to sup-
porting practitioners in developing managerial solutions to manage the
A-CDM application and preventing and managing the potential diffi-
culties and limitations.


In the future, our study can be improved by taking into account
other airports in the Italian context and by making a comparison with
the blockchain technologies adopted by other European and interna-
tional airports. In this case, it should also be interesting to investigate
whether and how cultural and social variables can affect the benefits of
blockchain technology in SCM for sustainable performance.
Furthermore, our research could benefit from the involvement of more
diverse participants and include managers, passengers, and policy
makers in SCM.


Appendix


Quotes from non-financial reports
The 2017 Naples airport non-financial report states:
“Since 2016 the Airport Collaborative Decision Making (A-CDM) system
is an integrated platform that transmits real-time status information
about all flights departing from EUROCONTROL (Network Management
Operations Center) which in turn transfers them to other connected
airports. Thus, it is possible to optimize the flow of air traffic, the airport
management, the use of airport infrastructure and human resources, by
increasing the flight punctuality and reducing fuel consumption and the
negative environmental impact.”
“There is a strong link between the Airport of Naples and the de-


velopment of Neapolitan and Campania tourism: in 2017 both the
Airport of Naples and the local institutions have confirmed the positive
trend recorded in previous years, testifying how an integrated strategy
to promote the destination and development of the airport connections
network can represent a mutual advantage for developing the tourism
economy and beyond.


Four years ago, GESAC defined the new strategy for developing the
Airport of Naples, starting from the analysis of the main opportunities.
… …… The Airport of Naples therefore set a specific goal consisting of
actively contributing to enhance the Neapolitan tourism destination,
promoting it, and achieving its enormous a leading tourist destination
in Europe, in the case of Naples for the city break segment.


In continuity with its strategy undertaken, in 2017 GESAC has
continued its efforts to strengthen the capacity of the territory to attract
as a tourist destination:


- Network and traffic development and marketing policies aimed at at-
tracting new airlines and opening new links with the national and in-
ternational market basins, which are more interesting both in terms of
incoming and outgoing;… …


- Promotion of the destination and communication program aimed at
promoting the uniqueness of the attractions of the Naples destination
which, since 2017, has assumed a more markedly cultural declination
with the objective of de-seasonalizing the tourist flows: Naples, a city for
'year!


Networking as an active and innovative role for the tourist devel-
opment of the Naples destination and, more generally, of the Campania
Region through a synergistic collaboration model that involves the
operators of the tourism industry, from public institutions to trade as-
sociations, from the directions of the museums poles and archaeological
sites to local mobility workers.”
