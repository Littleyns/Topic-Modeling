Abstract: The digital transformation of the manufacturing industry is currently unlocking new possibilities 
in terms of automation and improvement of existing business processes. Service is currently one of the key 
areas that are being affected by it and, while many use cases are proposed, their operational implementation 
often remains a challenge. This paper, focusing on the impact of information transparency on the 
formulation of an effective maintenance plan, is proposing a progressive implementation roadmap for a 
dynamic failure mode, effect and criticality analysis (FMECA), according to the digital maturity of the 
organization. Copyright © 2019 IFAC.

1. INTRODUCTION 


The manufacturing industry is currently facing a major change 
labelled, due to its nature, as digital transformation. This has 
been identified as a new competitive lever (McKinsey & 
Company, 2015) based on the use of data and connectivity 
capabilities. Its operationalization consists in the integration of 
the multiple players along the supply chain in an 
interconnected system (Porter & Heppelmann, 2014), 
translating the conceptual structure of companies from a 
pyramidal structure to a network of nodes (Jeshcke et al., 
2017). The promise is to unlock, through the exchange and use 
of data from across the supply chain, a new potential for 
improving the operational performance of multiple business 
areas. Hence, a key attribute of this transformation is the 
condition of transparency across this network (Schrauf & 
Berttram, 2016). This is translated in the availability of 
relevant information to the right instances for supporting the 
related decision-making processes (Winkler, 2000, Vaccaro & 
Madsen, 2006; DiPiazza & Eccles, 2002; Turilli et al., 2009). 
Service is one of the key areas to be affected and improved by 
the digital transformation and maintenance costs are meant to 
be reduced using its enabled capabilities (McKinsey & 
Company, 2015). More specifically, advanced diagnostic and 
prognostic systems to support maintenance activities through 
self-reparation and autonomous learning are being introduced 
(Fasanotti et al., 2018). However, due to the limited set of 
contexts considered for their application, there is a need for 
explorative studies for building an understanding of how to 
capitalize on these new capabilities (Fasanotti et al., 2018). 
Furthermore, due to the currently increasing degree of 
automation in manufacturing environments, which is 
transforming more and more labor intensive processes into 
automated processes, the magnitude of the impact of 
maintenance activities on business is constantly increasing. In 
turn, this results also in the diffusion of a product-service 
system based business models (Ardolino et al., 2017).  


As the digital transformation is considered to be a progressive 
transformation on multiple complexity levels (Schuh et al., 
2017), the unlocked possibilities for the improvement of 
maintenance activities have to be investigated in relation to the 
available capabilities and, therefore, the level of digital 
maturity achieved by a company.  
This research focuses on the failure mode, effect and criticality 
analysis (FMECA) currently used by manufacturing 
companies for the prioritization of maintenance activities. The 
concept of a dynamic FMECA, built around the capability to 
periodically update the analysis, has been proposed in extant 
literature and its positive impact on performance has been 
discussed, for example in regards to its influence on 
production processes (Mili et al., 2008a). However, an 
investigation regarding its implementation process is missing. 
The transparency and analytic capabilities, leading to decision 
making autonomy (Fasanotti et al., 2018), enabled by the 
deployment of novel digital technologies, such as the internet 
of things (IoT), are providing a new ground to be considered 
in regards to that. This paper investigates how these 
capabilities can support the implementation of a dynamic 
FMECA and how digital maturity progression can affect its 
deployment. According to that, the research presented in this 
paper addresses the following research question: “How can the 
digital transformation support the implementation of a 


dynamic FMECA?” 
The research is performed following a design science approach 
in its abduction phase (Hevener, 2004) and aims at proposing 
a conceptual framework for guiding the implementation of a 
dynamic FMECA according to the digital maturity of the 
organization.  The authors present, at first, a state of the art 
regarding the FMECA, the dynamic FMECA, and the digital 
maturity concepts. Secondly, the research methodology is 
illustrated. Then, the concept of a dynamic FMECA based on 
digital capabilities, and in relation to different digital maturity 
levels, is proposed. Eventually, its implication on maintenance 
performance and on the design of a customized service offer

capitalize on these new capabilities (Fasanotti et al., 2018). 
Furthermore, due to the currently increasing degree of 
automation in manufacturing environments, which is 
transforming more and more labor intensive processes into 
automated processes, the magnitude of the impact of 
maintenance activities on business is constantly increasing. In 
turn, this results also in the diffusion of a product-service 
system based business models (Ardolino et al., 2017).  


As the digital transformation is considered to be a progressive 
transformation on multiple complexity levels (Schuh et al., 
2017), the unlocked possibilities for the improvement of 
maintenance activities have to be investigated in relation to the 
available capabilities and, therefore, the level of digital 
maturity achieved by a company.  
This research focuses on the failure mode, effect and criticality 
analysis (FMECA) currently used by manufacturing 
companies for the prioritization of maintenance activities. The 
concept of a dynamic FMECA, built around the capability to 
periodically update the analysis, has been proposed in extant 
literature and its positive impact on performance has been 
discussed, for example in regards to its influence on 
production processes (Mili et al., 2008a). However, an 
investigation regarding its implementation process is missing. 
The transparency and analytic capabilities, leading to decision 
making autonomy (Fasanotti et al., 2018), enabled by the 
deployment of novel digital technologies, such as the internet 
of things (IoT), are providing a new ground to be considered 
in regards to that. This paper investigates how these 
capabilities can support the implementation of a dynamic 
FMECA and how digital maturity progression can affect its 
deployment. According to that, the research presented in this 
paper addresses the following research question: “How can the 
digital transformation support the implementation of a 


dynamic FMECA?” 
The research is performed following a design science approach 
in its abduction phase (Hevener, 2004) and aims at proposing 
a conceptual framework for guiding the implementation of a 
dynamic FMECA according to the digital maturity of the 
organization.  The authors present, at first, a state of the art 
regarding the FMECA, the dynamic FMECA, and the digital 
maturity concepts. Secondly, the research methodology is 
illustrated. Then, the concept of a dynamic FMECA based on 
digital capabilities, and in relation to different digital maturity 
levels, is proposed. Eventually, its implication on maintenance 
performance and on the design of a customized service offer

are discussed, and a conclusion that outlines the validation 
process of the proposed concept is provided. 


2. STATE OF THE ART 


2.1 The FMECA 


The FMECA is recognised as one of the most renown tools, 
within the maintenance domain, to collect experts’ knowledge 
and quantify the risks associated with the usage of the asset. 
Its outcome consists of an index, called Risk Priority Number 
(RPN) which prioritizes maintenance activities according to 
the risk related to a failure (Wang et al., 2014). The RPN is 
calculated, for each asset component, multiplying the 
following variables, usually provided by asset vendors and 
related to the production context:  


- Severity (S), which estimates how severely the failure 
would affect the user; 


- Occurrence (O), which estimates the probability of 
occurrence of a failure;  


- Detectability (D), which estimates the effectiveness 
of control to prevent the failure (or the probability of 
detecting a problem before it happens). 


The smaller the RPN, the better. Risks are then prioritized 
from the highest to the lowest according to their RPN, and the 
related maintenance activities are planned accordingly. 
Due to the way it is conceived, the FMECA gives a clear 
picture of the initial state of the system. However, the variables 
involved in the estimation of the risks can evolve over time. 
For example, the diverse usage conditions of the asset, the 
technological evolution or new skills acquired by the 
maintenance resources could influence the variables used to 
compute the RPN, thus affecting the results of the analysis and, 
thus, the planning decisions. Such an update can be hindered 
by the current approaches commonly adopted in companies. 
Indeed, Mili et al. (2008a) affirm that a considerable lack can 
be found in the information collection and risk codification, 
which is mostly not standardized and dependent on human 
expertise.  Moreover, as reported by Ben Said et al. (2016), 
FMECA updates are not frequent and are mostly based on 
human expertise. As of now, the FMECA is not always 
directly linked to the organizations’ information system (Mili 
et al., 2008b). In fact, despite the possibility offered by current 
Enterprise Information Systems to extract production and 
process data, humans must interpret these before updating the 
values contained in FMECA. Moreover, the static nature of 
FMECA, heavily dependent on human intervention, puts 
boundaries around the possibility to update it dynamically. In 
this way, the possibility to be quick in the adaptation of 
maintenance policies according to new criticalities and, 
eventually, of the maintenance plan, fades.  


2.2 Towards a dynamic FMECA 


In response to the limitations listed in section 2.1, some 
authors proposed a novel approach to the FMECA, based on 
its more frequent update (Van Bossuyt et al., 2010; Mili et al., 
2008b). What emerges from literature is that the FMECA can 
be used at an operational level if employed in a dynamic way, 
addressing, in addition to the maintenance plan, quality and 
process aspects based on the risk classification. Moreover, it 


could also be used as a performance measure for production 
processes (Mili et al., 2008a). Due to that, the risk 
prioritization through RPN computation remains one of its 
most important characteristics. Linked to this, as Ben Said et 
al. (2014) report, dynamic FMECA is fundamental for the 
provision of updated support to maintenance, especially by 
establishing a continuous bound between what happens in the 
shop floor, the risk analysis, and the maintenance activities 
(Bassetto et al., 2011). In support, (Ben Said et al., 2016) 
reports a case of mixed usage of FMECA and Bayesian 
Networks to use it in an operational way, enabling the 
possibility to identify causal relations between the information 
present in the system. In this case, the interactions between the 
Bayesian Network and the FMECA are aimed at supporting 
the renewal of experts’ knowledge and improve the 
effectiveness of maintenance actions, providing feedback 
afterwards. As introduced earlier, the FMECA improvement 
not only has effects on the maintenance plans but, in turn, on 
the production process as well (Wang et al., 2014). In fact, on 
one hand, a reduced downtime, due to an improved 
maintenance plan definition, results in increased production 
time. On the other hand, the identification of risks and 
problems enabled by the FMECA allows also to make 
improvements to the production process, highlighting new 
potential process problems. One of the topics that must be 
addressed in order to pave the way towards a more dynamic 
update of the FMECA is the information collection, exchange 
and usage (Mili et al., 2009; Mili et al., 2008a). The literature 
analysis shows that the way information is managed, and the 
tools used to support it, affect the way FMECA can be 
dynamically updated. In regards to that, the importance of the 
adoption of a Computerized Maintenance Management 
Systems (CMMS) for asset management and, more 
specifically, for information management aimed at 
maintenance activities, has been highlighted (Lopes et al., 
2016). Furthermore, Balouei et al. (2018) state that the role of 
CMMS in maintenance management will become even greater 
in the future, due to the growth of data and, thus, of the need 
for information management. In this sense, the possibility to 
automate information collection, processing and exchange 
through the use of a CMMS makes possible to provide support 
for the concept of dynamic FMECA and its possible 
declinations. These would depend on the autonomy of the 
information management processes. Literature reports 
different cases for this. While case studies about static 
FMECA are widely discussed, Wang et al. (Wang et al., 2014) 
describe a situation where FMECA is used in a dynamic way, 
but the process is carried out manually by human experts and 
in an intermittent manner. Instead, Mili et al. (2009) and Ben 
Said et al. (2016) describe two case studies where the software 
is able to compute failure data and to autonomously propose 
updates for the FMECA. However, the intervention of the 
human expert is still required for the validation of the updates 
and, in turn, for the update of the maintenance policies for the 
different components and, eventually, of the maintenance plan. 
However, no empirical evidence has been found supporting the 
implementation of this type of dynamic FMECA, considering 
the related increasing degree of autonomy.

2.3 The digital maturity progression 


The digital transformation has been defined as a journey across 
multiple complexity levels (Schuh et al., 2017). Researchers 
and research institutions proposed multiple progression 
models – based on the maturity concept – through academic 
publications and industrial reports, for guiding the digital 
transformation (Colli et al., 2018). The concept of maturity as 
a development progression based on building incremental 
capabilities has been originated in relation to electronic data 
processing (Gibson & Nolan, 1974) and in quality 
management (Crosby, 1979). Looking at this concept under a 
digital transformation magnifying glass, in terms of 
capabilities, the development progression generally starts from 
being able to identify events and eventually reaches the ability 
of dealing with events autonomously, after building an 
understanding of the causes of the event and of the patterns 
that make possible to forecast future scenarios (Schuh et al., 
2017). Colli et al. (2018), based on a review of existing digital 
maturity models, translate this progression in a sequence of 
steps consisting, technical wise, in the ability to generate 
digital data, the achievement of data availability where needed 
for supporting decision making processes, the introduction of 
analytic capabilities for analyzing it, augmenting the existing 
knowledge, and the establishing of an autonomous decision 
making process based first on company data and, eventually, 
on data from across the whole supply chain. Under a 
maintenance point of view, Fasanotti et al. (2018) see sensor-
generated information as the catalyst for the transition towards 
a proactive maintenance planning, with less human 
involvement in the inspection and decision-making processes. 
Thus, the incremental progression of digital maturity related 
capabilities is used as a base line for the formulation of a 
currently missing implementation model of the existing 
dynamic FMECA concept. 


3. METHODOLOGY 


This research consists of model development, obtained 
following a design science approach (Hevener, 2004; Van 
Aken, 2004; Vaishnavi & Kuechler, 2008). This starts from the 
development of an artefact through an abductive process. The 
artefact, consisting of an implementation framework for the 
concept of dynamic FMECA, has its foundation based on 
literature regarding this concept. The model development 
process was complemented by a literature analysis as an 
outcome of research carried out on the SCOPUS database. The 
literature review focused on the concepts of FMECA and 
dynamic FMECA in the context of the technological 
revolution happening in the current decade. Specifically, 
authors were interested in studying the literature on the 
dynamic FMECA from the perspective of the organizations’ 


digital maturity, investigating how the digital maturity of an 
organization could affect the FMECA capabilities and, in turn, 
its autonomy. Eventually, in order to propose an 
implementation framework based on the possibilities unlocked 
by the digital transformation, the needs in terms of digital 
capabilities related to the existing dynamic FMECA concept 
are identified and related to existing digital maturity concepts 
and to their maturity levels. As an outcome, a progression in 


terms of implementation stages based on the digital maturity 
level and on the related capabilities is proposed. 


4. MODEL DEVELOPMENT 


The implementation of a dynamic FMECA is based on the 
increase of integration from an Information System point of 
view, as its concept is strongly bounded with information 
availability and business process automation. This is meant to 
generate information transparency - and support its use - across 
assets to be maintained and who has to maintain them. This 
task is supported by new digital technologies, specifically IoT, 
which enable the achievement of information transparency 
(Brody & Pureswaran, 2015). As the digital transformation 
journey and, therefore, the achievement and use of information 
transparency and of analytic and autonomy capabilities are 
considered to be incremental, the authors propose a 
progression of dynamic FMECA solutions based on this 
progression. Hence, this outlined sequence of implementation 
stages sets its foundation on the available digital capabilities 
and, therefore, on the digital maturity of the organization 
which aims at implementing a dynamic FMECA. Three 
implementation stages for the adoption of a dynamic FMECA 
in the service department of a manufacturing company that has 
to take care of the maintenance of its own assets are proposed. 
They consist in three sequential typologies of dynamic 
FMECA – manual, assisted, and autonomous – meant to work 
on top of the existing CMMS and supported by increasing 
digital maturity (and of the related capabilities) and 
characterized by the increasing level of automation of the 
FMECA processes. 


4.1 Manual dynamic FMECA 


The service department of the manufacturing company, in 
order to perform the FMECA for defining a maintenance plan, 
is manually collecting the needed information by accessing the 
CMMS. Here, failure data from the monitored assets as well 
as reports of the performed maintenance activities are 
manually inserted by the operator. Data is then manually 
analyzed within the service department, where failure types 
and implications (e.g. related downtime, involved 
components) are identified and the FMECA performed, see 
Fig. 1. Eventually, failures are ranked by calculating the RPN.

According to that, the service department updates the 
maintenance policies defined for all the considered 
components and, thus, the maintenance plan. The service is 
provided accordingly. The digital capabilities needed in order 
to sustain the manual dynamic FMECA consist in an IT 
infrastructure that supports a CMMS accessible, on one side, 
by the operators for introducing failure and maintenance 
activities related data digitally and, on the other, by the service 
department for visualizing it. 


4.2 Assisted dynamic FMECA 


The service department of the manufacturing company, in 
order to perform the FMECA, is manually collecting the 
needed information by accessing the CMMS, where failure 
data are automatically uploaded by the assets and the 
performed maintenance activities are registered. Afterwards, 
as for the manual dynamic FMECA, see section 4.1, data is 
manually analyzed by the service department which, 
eventually, performs the FMECA and rank them by calculating 
the RPN. The service department updates, accordingly, the 
maintenance policies related to the different components and 
the maintenance plan that guides the service provision, see Fig. 
2. The digital capabilities needed in order to sustain the 
assisted dynamic FMECA consist, in addition to the ones 
described for the manual version, see section 4.1, in having an 
IT infrastructure that includes the monitored assets, which 
have to be able to upload in the CMMS the needed failure data 
automatically. 
 


 
Fig. 2. Assisted dynamic FMECA 


4.3 Autonomous dynamic FMECA 


The service department of the manufacturing company, as well 
as the assets, are connected to an IoT platform which hosts the 
CMMS and an analytic engine. While the assets automatically 
upload failure data and maintenance activities to the CMMS, 
an analytic engine processes this data, automatically 
performing the FMECA. The service department receives, 
therefore, a constantly updated FMECA as well as RPN and, 
after validating the results, can constantly re-assign 
maintenance policies according to the FMECA results and 
optimize the effectiveness of the maintenance plan. The 
service department provides the service accordingly, see 
Error! Reference source not found.. The digital capabilities 


needed in order to sustain the autonomous dynamic FMECA 
consist, in addition to the ones described for the assisted 
version, see section 4.2, in introducing an IoT platform with 
analytic capabilities and which is hosting the CMMS. This 
platform has to be interconnected with the assets, data source, 
and the service department, data user. 
 





Fig. 3. Autonomous dynamic FMECA 


5. DISCUSSION 


The concept of dynamic FMECA is already existing and it has 
been discussed in the extant literature. However, 
implementation guidelines are missing. The digital 
transformation and the increase of digital maturity are 
expected to support its implementation and progressively 
unlock new capabilities – in particular, the increase of 
information transparency and the enabling of analytic 
capabilities first and autonomy next – that are considered to be 
key elements for the implementation of a dynamic FMECA, 
see Fig. 4. The organization’s digital competencies play a 
central role in the determination of the way a dynamic FMECA 
can be implemented. The more companies are digitalized and 
able to manage the information across them, the higher is their 
digital maturity level. In fact, the human intervention required 
for different purposes, from data extraction to elaboration, 
ending in creating the logical connections between the 
FMECA update and the defined maintenance plans, is 
inversely proportional to the level of digital maturity. 
Increasing the digital maturity of an organization means that 
the Information System (IS) and, more specifically, the 
CMMS, is able, at different levels, to collect and elaborate 
data, and expose the results in a way that makes possible to 
update easily the maintenance plans. Possibly, at the maximum 
digital maturity level, the CMMS would be able to update 
autonomously the maintenance plans, reducing the necessity 
for a human-in-the-loop (HIL), which is the necessity for the 
system to interact with humans (Parasuraman et al., 1997; 
Pinto et al. 2013). However, in the proposed framework, it has 
been considered the need for a human validation of the updated 
FMECA results in order to translate it in the re-assignment of 
maintenance policies for the different components and, 
eventually, in the re-formulation of the maintenance plan. The

According to that, the service department updates the

HIL still has a crucial role in translating raw data in operational 
decisions, mostly because of the current impossibility to 
collect and interpret data related to all the contextual elements 
that must be taken into account in the decision making process. 
The ability of the CMMS to update the FMECA strongly 
depends upon the data interpretability and their interpretation. 
The interpretability of data is a consequence of the way they 
are collected, structured and elaborated. Different components 
along the IS could require the same data structured in different 
ways: for this reason, it is fundamental to define a common 
language and methodology that guides the data collection, 
storage, and elaboration. Automating this aspect means 
enhancing and facilitating the communication among the 
components of the IS, allowing to automatize certain parts of 
the elaboration process and saving time for other operations. If 
there is no compliance between the IS components, the human 
intervention will be necessary to enable data collection and 
processing within the CMMS and the FMECA update. The 
concept of data interpretability is bond to the one of data 
interpretation. In fact, also in this case, giving the instruments 
to the IS components to understand the data under analysis and 
the meaning of the results means to shorten the time required 
to complete part of the process. Moreover, an IS able to 
interpret data correctly has a higher degree of autonomy, due 
to the diminished need for human expertise in some of the 
decision making processes. Something worth noting is that if 
data is not interpreted correctly, misleading information could 
be saved in the database, resulting in wrong risk estimation, 
maintenance policies and, thus, maintenance plans. Before 
updating one or more values in the FMECA it is important to 
verify that it is correct to do so. Updating a value in the 
FMECA after each maintenance intervention is not 
trustworthy and results in an unreliable instrument for the 
definition of the maintenance policies. Something that can be 
done in this sense is to implement a statistical test to 
understand if one or more values are significantly changed or 
not. To perform the test it is necessary to keep track of the 
maintenance interventions and analyze the related 
maintenance reports. The implementation of a dynamic 
FMECA allows to define maintenance policies tailored on 
single components on the base of the asset usage.

digital maturity 


Moreover, the update of the single maintenance policies allows 
to define and update the maintenance plans, which represent 
the ensemble of the maintenance policies for the single 
components. Being able to define improved maintenance plans 
make possible also to improve the scheduling of the operators 
based on their skills and the problems of the assets. 


6. CONCLUSION 


The fourth industrial revolution is changing the way 
organizations are exploiting their assets. The continuous 
generation, collection and analysis of data opens up for new 
possibilities for the improvement of the production processes, 
which can be enhanced in many ways and under different 
aspects. One of these areas is asset maintenance, as 
demonstrated by the considerable importance that this topic 
obtained in literature. One of the most diffused instruments to 
manage maintenance activities is the FMECA. This is used to 
identify the assets’ most critical components and, thus, as an 


input for the definition of the maintenance policies and plans. 
Despite this, the usage of the FMECA in a static manner limits 
the effectiveness of a maintenance plan due to the lack of 
consideration of environmental changes (e.g. asset usage). 
Because of this, some authors proposed the concept of 
dynamic FMECA, based on the capability to periodically 
update components’ criticality and, thus, guiding maintenance 
plans’ update. This paper proposes a schematisation of the 


implementation stages for the dynamic FMECA, which are 
strongly bound to information transparency in the organization 
and, in turn, to the organization digital maturity level. Three 
stages are proposed, starting from manual data processing for 
supporting the FMECA and, after an assisted one, ending with 
an autonomous FMECA, where data processing is performed 
by an IoT platform. This paper presents a theoretical 
framework for implementing a dynamic FMECA.  In order to 
provide implementation guidelines at a more operational level, 
additional research concerning its application in a real case is 
required. To do so, further information regarding the FMECA 
activities, the needed data and their use for defining 
maintenance policies and plans are required. In addition, for 
understating its implications on the organization’s 


performance, historical data related to the assets’ performance 
and to the maintenance activities are needed. This have to be 
compared with a simulation of the corresponding behaviour 
using a dynamic FMECA. Furthermore, the performance 
improvement corresponding to the digital maturity increase 
has to be validated studying the impact of the growing 
automation in the FMECA update process. To do so, 
differences concerning data reliability and needed resources in 
the three digital maturity stages have to be taken into account. 
These activities are planned for future publications.
