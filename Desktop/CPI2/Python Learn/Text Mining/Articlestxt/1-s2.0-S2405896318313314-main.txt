Abstract: The convergence of physical and online retailing paves the way for the emergence of a retailing 
omnichannel. Omnichannel retailing supply chain management is challenged by uncertainty, oscillations 
in sales volume and supply-demand incompatibility. Dealing with those challenges requires the adoption 
of strategies focused on complex systems that properly employ new information and communication 
technologies as well as intelligent decision methods. In this context, this research paper aims to propose a 
reference model for a predictive and adaptive management approach for omnichannel retailing supply 
chain combining machine learning to minimize uncertainty and simulation based optimization to handle 
supply-demand synchronization.

1. INTRODUCTION 


The fast development of the global economy, information 
technology, and the advance of e-business, are making people 
demand higher levels of logistics service (FRAZZON. 2009; 
YAN-QIU and HAO, 2016), as well as more agile 
(GUNASEKARAN and NGAI, 2004) and dynamics supply 
chains (VAKHARI, 2002). Thus, logistics and supply chain 
activities management is becoming more complex, uncertain, 
costly and vulnerable according to Wu et al. (2016). Okada, 
Namatame and Sato (2016) argue that due to the complexity, 
uncertainty, and other factors involved, most of the actual 
supply chains are known to have many supply-demand 
incompatibility problems, which causes excess or lack of 
stock, as well as delays of delivery, with consequent damages 
to the level of service offered. 


This scenario is also observed in the retail supply chain, 
because with the emergence of a strong online channel a 
major transformation in retail logistics in the last decade has 
occurred. However, some challenges still remain to 
implement the online channel in the most efficient way and to 
create a seamless shopping experience, ensuring the 
compliance of product deliveries both in physical stores and 
directly to the consumer, and redesign their processes 
according to Hübner, Wollenburg and Holzapfel (2015) and 
fast delivery in accordance with Lee (2017). 


In order to face the challenges and ensure the online channel 
efficiently, it is necessary to minimize the factors of 
uncertainty and the oscillations in sales volume, since, due to 
these two factors, companies are having to adopt strategies 
focused on complex systems that deal with multichannel, and 
even omnichannels, as is the case with retailers 4.0 (LEE, 
2017). 


With the same focus on process integration, Butner (2010) 
argues that supply chains need to become "smart," adopting 
an intelligent infrastructure to jointly incorporate the data, 


information, products, objects, and business processes 
according Schuster, Allen and Brock (2007). 


In order to minimize the uncertainty regarding demand Nita 
(2015) states that the application of big data analysis 
technologies to predict products demand has increased, such 
as machine learning techniques. These techniques provide the 
analysis of the available database and also assist in the 
information evaluation of the supplies forecast according to 
Shen and Chan (2017). This fact is also highlighted by Lee 
(2017) in affirming the growing importance the practice of 
big data analytics for omnichannel retailers. 


And aiming at the best way of structuring the supply chain 
and consequently the synchronization of the supply with the 
demand Okada, Namatame and Sato (2016) sustain that the 
agent-based simulation (ABS) model can be used to analyse 
different stages of the supply chain, in order to determine 
what could happen in different scenarios, such as in a supply 
chain where supply is not sufficient to meet the demand. And 
analysing different stages of the supply chain can provide 
information on possible effects or consequences of delays, 
minimizing distorted information and significant 
inefficiencies in the supply chain (OKADA et al., 2017). 


This research paper aims to propose a conceptual model for 
predictive and adaptive management approach for 
omnichannel retailing supply chain combining machine 
learning and simulation based optimization. For that purpose, 
a brief literature review embracing retail supply chain, 
industrie 4.0 and simulation based optimization methods in 
supply chain. Finally, the conceptual model is described and 
a simulation model is proposed. Being the implementation of 
the machine learning part presented with greater detail and 
explanation in another moment.

Abstract: The convergence of physical and online retailing paves the way for the emergence of a retailing 
omnichannel. Omnichannel retailing supply chain management is challenged by uncertainty, oscillations 
in sales volume and supply-demand incompatibility. Dealing with those challenges requires the adoption 
of strategies focused on complex systems that properly employ new information and communication 
technologies as well as intelligent decision methods. In this context, this research paper aims to propose a 
reference model for a predictive and adaptive management approach for omnichannel retailing supply 
chain combining machine learning to minimize uncertainty and simulation based optimization to handle 
supply-demand synchronization.

1. INTRODUCTION 


The fast development of the global economy, information 
technology, and the advance of e-business, are making people 
demand higher levels of logistics service (FRAZZON. 2009; 
YAN-QIU and HAO, 2016), as well as more agile 
(GUNASEKARAN and NGAI, 2004) and dynamics supply 
chains (VAKHARI, 2002). Thus, logistics and supply chain 
activities management is becoming more complex, uncertain, 
costly and vulnerable according to Wu et al. (2016). Okada, 
Namatame and Sato (2016) argue that due to the complexity, 
uncertainty, and other factors involved, most of the actual 
supply chains are known to have many supply-demand 
incompatibility problems, which causes excess or lack of 
stock, as well as delays of delivery, with consequent damages 
to the level of service offered. 


This scenario is also observed in the retail supply chain, 
because with the emergence of a strong online channel a 
major transformation in retail logistics in the last decade has 
occurred. However, some challenges still remain to 
implement the online channel in the most efficient way and to 
create a seamless shopping experience, ensuring the 
compliance of product deliveries both in physical stores and 
directly to the consumer, and redesign their processes 
according to Hübner, Wollenburg and Holzapfel (2015) and 
fast delivery in accordance with Lee (2017). 


In order to face the challenges and ensure the online channel 
efficiently, it is necessary to minimize the factors of 
uncertainty and the oscillations in sales volume, since, due to 
these two factors, companies are having to adopt strategies 
focused on complex systems that deal with multichannel, and 
even omnichannels, as is the case with retailers 4.0 (LEE, 
2017). 


With the same focus on process integration, Butner (2010) 
argues that supply chains need to become "smart," adopting 
an intelligent infrastructure to jointly incorporate the data, 


information, products, objects, and business processes 
according Schuster, Allen and Brock (2007). 


In order to minimize the uncertainty regarding demand Nita 
(2015) states that the application of big data analysis 
technologies to predict products demand has increased, such 
as machine learning techniques. These techniques provide the 
analysis of the available database and also assist in the 
information evaluation of the supplies forecast according to 
Shen and Chan (2017). This fact is also highlighted by Lee 
(2017) in affirming the growing importance the practice of 
big data analytics for omnichannel retailers. 


And aiming at the best way of structuring the supply chain 
and consequently the synchronization of the supply with the 
demand Okada, Namatame and Sato (2016) sustain that the 
agent-based simulation (ABS) model can be used to analyse 
different stages of the supply chain, in order to determine 
what could happen in different scenarios, such as in a supply 
chain where supply is not sufficient to meet the demand. And 
analysing different stages of the supply chain can provide 
information on possible effects or consequences of delays, 
minimizing distorted information and significant 
inefficiencies in the supply chain (OKADA et al., 2017). 


This research paper aims to propose a conceptual model for 
predictive and adaptive management approach for 
omnichannel retailing supply chain combining machine 
learning and simulation based optimization. For that purpose, 
a brief literature review embracing retail supply chain, 
industrie 4.0 and simulation based optimization methods in 
supply chain. Finally, the conceptual model is described and 
a simulation model is proposed. Being the implementation of 
the machine learning part presented with greater detail and 
explanation in another moment.

Due to increased competition, traditional retailers strive to 
differentiate, offering a greater variety of products and higher 
levels of product availability in stores, while reducing total 
operating costs. (DUBEY; VEERAMANI, 2017). 


Lee (2017) sustain that with the ongoing digitalization 
processes and with the distinctions between offline and 
online channels disappearing, multichannel retailing is 
moving to the omni-channel retail. Saghiri et al. (2017) states 
that the omni-channel retailer has the purpose of coordinating 
processes and technologies across all channels in order to 
provide more integrated, consistent and reliable service to 
customers. And with the increasing variety of channel 
formats on the omni-channel, they have made the shopping 
process more convenient for buyers, and more difficult to 
manage for upstream suppliers and downstream retailers 
(AILAWADI; FARRIS, 2017). 


Difficulty that are found in the works of Ivanov (2017) and 
Gao et al. (2017) by highlighting and analysing the impact of 
the bullwhip effect, caused by fluctuations in demand, and 
the ripple effect, caused by disruptions in the supply, 
production and distribution processes, in the supply chain and 
the retail supply chain respectively. Thus, the omnichannel 
concept of Ailawadi e Farris (2017) accepts the inevitability 
of the need to employ multiple channels and is focused on 
integrating activities within and between channels to match 
the way consumers buy. 


Saghiri et al. (2017) emphasize that integration and visibility 
are the two main enablers of the omni-channel structure to 
reduce uncertainties and variations. To implement the omni-
channel integration Saghiri et al. (2017) states that integration 
is necessary from three perspectives: integration of the stages 
of the channels (pre-purchase, payment, delivery, return), 
types of channels (online and off-line), and the agents of 
channels. And in terms of visibility was highlighted the 
ability of supply chain members to provide, share, and 
retrieve timely information such as product visibility, 
demand, order / payment, inventory, shipment / delivery, and 
supplies. 


The framework presented by Saghiri et al. (2017) mainly 
reflect the operations an information management on the 
omnichannel, but does not address problems like customer 
behaviour. So, in order to minimize the factors of uncertainty 
and better understand customer purchase behaviour Lee 
(2017) states that retailers are encouraged to devote 
investments in big data consumer analytics. And to explore 
omnichannel operational/tactical implications with more 
detail Saghiri et al. (2017) suggest the application of an 
analytical study. 


2.2 Industrie 4.0 in Supply Chain Management 


In the literature, several terms are used to describe this new 
form of communication and integration of processes to fulfill 
customer requests, being them industry 4.0, industrie 4.0, 
supply chain 4.0, smart factory, smart manufactory, smart 
supply chain, intelligent manufactory, industrial internet, 
integrated industry, e physical internet. 


Within the supply chain Wu et al. (2016) states that the smart 
supply chain enables data collection and real-time 
communication of all stages of the supply chain, intelligent 


decision making, and an efficient and appropriate process to 
better serve customers. 


However, Liao et al. (2017) states that there is still an 
absence, or insufficient, research effort on end-to-end digital 
integration, which has been conceptualized as integration into 
the entire engineering process so that the digital and real 
worlds are integrated into the entire value chain of a product 
and in different companies, in addition to incorporating the 
requirements of the customer (Scholz-Reiter et al., 2011). 
And while some research guidelines are not officially listed 
as priority areas, some research efforts can be found in 
relation to Data Science, such as real-time data analysis, data 
integration, and Big Data Analytics. 


The benefits identified in the use of Big Data and Business 
Analytics in supply chain are in achieving greater visibility of 
performance, cost trends and fluctuations, inventory 
monitoring, production optimization, manage demand 
volatility, supply chain network design and transportation and 
sourcing optimization (ISASI et al., 2015; HAZEN et al., 
2014; OLIVEIRA; MCCORMACK and TRKMAN, 2012). 


When analyzing the demand forecast in the Big Data 
scenario, Shen and Chan (2017), Islek and Oguducu (2015) 
and Sarhani and El Afia (2014) they have identified that the 
use of advanced machine learning techniques to initially train 
the large amount of data, to later predict demand, provides 
more accurate information in the supply chain. 


The best and frequently used method for uncertain demand 
forecasts, in the literature, is neural network and its variants, 
because of their inherent ability to perform better on 
unpredictable and uncertain demand patterns according to 
Amirkolaii et al. (2017). However, build individual forecasts 
for a large number of unique customer demands is 
impractical states Murray, Agard and Barajas (2015), being 
necessary the application of grouping customers into logical 
segments, like partitional clustering, that represent the total 
customer population states. 


For analysis of supply information sharing Shen and Chan 
(2017) point out that there is still a gap in forecasting supply 
information for supply chain management, but that this can 
be changed by applying big data technologies and that 
analysis through simulation is one of the most significant 
approaches to predicting market demand and supply. 


2.3 Simulation and Optimization 


The complexities of most real-world systems are related to 
their stochastic nature and the wide variety of internal and 
external interactions of these systems, and that simulation-
based techniques can be used to develop or evaluate complex 
systems. (KÜCK et al., 2016). However, according to Kück 
et al. (2016) the simulation cannot guarantee the optimization 
of these systems in relation to one or more performance 
indicators such as lead-time, cost of production, among 
others, and that optimization methods are mainly used when a 
complex system can be modeled by a simplified abstraction. 


Frazzon et al. (2015) argue that the ability of existing models 
to support intelligent and flexible synchronization, and the 
coordination of the process involved are limited. For 
example, linear programming models are not able to cope 
adequately with stochastic behavior. On the other hand, the

simulation models have limited capacity to support the 
identification of exact and optimal solutions. 


Govindan, Fattahi and Keyvanshokooh (2017) sustain that 
modeling approaches is an interesting research idea in order 
to fill the gap between stochastic programming and robust 
optimization. Thus, a promising approach that combines the 
strengths of simulation and optimization is known as 
simulation-based optimization (SBO), the simulation model 
being used as the objective function of the optimization and 
the optimization method used to determine the optimal 
configuration of simulation parameters according to Kück et 
al. (2016). 


According to Frazzon et al. (2015; 2017) combination of both 
can also provide relevant capabilities for the management of 
supply chains. In the context of demand forecasting and 
simulation-based optimization of processes for the supply 
chain, researchers diversified in the choice of methods to 
predict quantity and analyze sales behavior of the products, 
and to structure and optimize the distribution processes. 


In the field of the optimization Lee (2017) proposed an 
optimization model based on genetic algorithms (GA) to 
support anticipatory shipping, Yan-qiu and Hao (2016) have 
developed a multilevel logistics supply network optimization 
model with constraints on distribution capacity, inventory 
capacity and improved customer delivery time. And dealing 
with simulation, Okada, Namatame and Sato (2016) describe 
an agent-based simulation tool for designing smart supply 
chain networks as well as logistics networks. Therefore, it 
was possible to identify the lack of a research that 
approached the simulation and the optimization together in a 
smart supply chain, and consequently of the retail supply 
chain.  


3. CONCEPTUAL MODEL 


In this section, the conceptual model for predictive and 
adaptive management approach for omnichannel retailing 
supply chain is proposed (Figure 1). As shown in Fig. 1, the 
retailer supply chain is composed of customers/clients, 
retailers, representing the off-line channel, the online store, 
which represents the online channel, regional distribution 
center, central distribution center and a supplier. 


Even though it is a generic omnichannel retail supply chain, 
its entities and relations seek to represent the retail supply 
chains presented in the literature and in real scenarios. 


In order for the omnichannel retail supply chain management 
present a predictive approach it was proposed the analysis of 
the demand forecast through techniques of big data, such as 
machine learning, and to exhibit an adaptive approach, the 
coordination of demand and supply was proposed through the 
application of simulation based optimization. 


To make the predictive and adaptive management of the 
omnichannel retail supply chain possible, this conceptual 
model assumed that the supply chain has integrated 
information and communication technologies in order to 
allow the real-time information sharing and intelligent 
decision making process. 


And it was designed to present an integrated order 
fulfillment, in order to lead to a higher service level for 
customers, and product information, to initiate the necessary 


corrective actions in cases of mismatch in stock status 
according with Saghiri et al. (2017). Since the joint 
management of the two integrations allows the visibility of 
the product, demand, inventory, shipment/delivery and 
supply. 


In order to develop this model, it is proposed the integration 
of machine learning and simulation-based optimization. This 
integration will occur through the communication between 
machine learning software and simulation software, where 
while the machine learning software generates a solution, the 
simulation software evaluates this solution into a virtual 
model and returns the results to the first software. And this 
process occurs until a stopping criterion is satisfied or met. 


3.1 Machine Learning 


The machine learning, represented in the conceptual model 
by the blue color, was proposed to forecast demand in order 
to provide better identification of customer behaviour, 
reduction of uncertainties related to demand, and 
consequently anticipate the execution of the distribution 
processes of the supply chain. 


In the application of the machine learning, two types of 
analysis are proposed: clustering, for the identification of 
customer behavior by the application of clustering 
algorithms, and then demand forecasting, by the application 
of artificial neural networks to the demand forecast of each 
product from each of the stores. 


In this way, the input data of the clustering model are the 
information of the sales history of the online and offline 
stores, collected and stored monthly and analyzed for the 
formation of the clusters. As output of clustering will be 
identified the number of clusters formed and which cluster 
each product belongs. 


Subsequently the data found by the clustering will be 
analyzed as input for the forecast to provide a demand 
forecasting with greater accuracy and less uncertainties. The 
output from the artificial neural network will be the demand 
of each product from each online and offline store. 


And the demand forecast information/data, result of the 
application of the artificial neural networks, is the input data 
of the simulation based optimization model for the 
anticipation of the product distribution process. 


3.2 Simulation based optimization 


The simulation based optimization, represented by the green 
color in the conceptual model, was proposed to analyze the 
behavior of the omnichannel retail supply chain to adapt to 
the uncertainties of the forecast and actual demands and 
reduce lead time, when performing the distribution activities 
with the lowest lead time and cost. 


In order to reduce the lead time, this supply chain proposed 
the anticipatory of the distribution process, and because this 
process is based on a forecast of demand and can have 
incompatibility between real demand and forecasting, in this 
model we have also proposed the checking process to adapt 
to these distortions and ensure the sale of the product to the 
customer. 


To represent both the anticipatory and the adaptive process 
the distribution process presented in this generic model of the

Gao et al. (2017) by highlighting and analysing the impact of 
the bullwhip effect, caused by fluctuations in demand, and

ability of supply chain members to provide, share, and 
retrieve timely information such as product visibility, 
demand, order / payment, inventory, shipment / delivery, and 
supplies. 


The framework presented by Saghiri et al. (2017) mainly 
reflect the operations an information management on the 
omnichannel, but does not address problems like customer 
behaviour. So, in order to minimize the factors of uncertainty 
and better understand customer purchase behaviour Lee 
(2017) states that retailers are encouraged to devote 
investments in big data consumer analytics. And to explore 
omnichannel operational/tactical implications with more 
detail Saghiri et al. (2017) suggest the application of an

omnichannel retail supply chain is composed by the 
information and material flows. 


As can be seen in Fig 1, the information flow of the 
simulation based optimization model is the flow responsible 
for initializing the distribution process, and this can happen in 
two distinct moments. Considering that this supply chain 


share the demand forecast information, the first moment is 
from the arrival of demand forecast information, coming 
from the machine learning, and the second moment is with 
the information of the sale of products by the online and 
offline stores. 





Fig. 1. Proposed conceptual model for omnichannel retailing supply chain management. 


To represent both the anticipatory and the adaptive process 
the distribution process presented in this generic model of the 
omnichannel retail supply chain is composed by the 
information and material flows. 


As can be seen in Fig 1, the information flow of the 
simulation based optimization model is the flow responsible 
for initializing the distribution process, and this can happen in 
two distinct moments. Considering that this supply chain 
share the demand forecast information, the first moment is 
from the arrival of demand forecast information, coming 
from the machine learning, and the second moment is with 
the information of the sale of products by the online and 
offline stores. After the arrival of the demand forecast 
information, the supply chain aims to anticipate the 
distribution process to leave the product in the distribution 
center closest to the end customer, even before the sale of the 
product. Therefore, the distribution process represented by 
the material flow in Fig. 1, adopt the pushed flows from the 
supplier to the central and regional distribution centers, based 
on demand forecast information in order to reduce the lead 
time. 


From the distribution centers, the distribution process starts 
according to the sales realized by the online and offline 
channels. With the product sales, the process of information 
flow of both online and offline stores starts. In the online 
stores, the sale information is directed to the distribution 
center that will respond to the request, and in the off-line 
stores, the checking process of the availability of the product 
for sale is started. 


The checking process, who is performed by the retailer and 
regional and central distributors, is carried out with each sale, 
based on real demand, and on a monthly basis, based on 
demand forecasting. In this process, firstly is analyzed the 
necessary amount of product in stock and what’s already 
been sent to each member, that meet the real demand. If the 
store has the product, it is taken from the inventory and the 
sale is made, otherwise the member places an order request to 
the previous member to send the product. With the orders 
placed and the necessity of product identified, the material 
flow is started by the regional and central distribution center. 


The adoption of pull and push flow types in the same 
distribution process occurred so that there is a balance 
between the lead time reduction and the quantity of stocks in

the chain. If it were adopted only the pushed flow the product 
would be left in the off-line stores, which would be the 
closest link of the customers, the delivery lead time for the 
customer would be the smallest but there would be a large 
amount of stock, and if it were adopted only the pulled flow 
the amount of stock in the chain would be smaller, but the 
lead time would be higher. 





4. TEST CASE 


In this section, is proposed the application of the simulation 
part of the conceptual model, using the software Anylogic, 
and the machine learning and the optimization parts was 
considered their effect in the supply chain to demonstrate the 
effectiveness of the machine learning and the anticipatory 
process of the distribution in the omnichannel retailing 
supply chain. Thereof, two scenarios will be developed, the 
first one a generic supply chain, as it has been presented in 
the literature, and the second with the application of the 
conceptual model presented in the section 3. 


In the first scenario, the omnichannel retail supply chain is 
represented without the application of machine learning and 
anticipatory process and is composed by the information and 
material flows as illustrated in Figure 2. 





Fig. 2. Simulation first scenario 


As shown in Fig 2, in accordance with the sales history the 
retail place an order to the regional distribution center, which, 
in turn, place the order to central distribution center, who 
send the order to the supplier. And after the information flow 
of the order reach the supplier, the distribution process starts 
with the material flow. 


In order to reduce uncertainties and lead time, and improve 
service level and synchronization of demand and supply, the 
second scenario, illustrated in Figure 3, is developed with the 
application of machine learning and the anticipatory 
distribution process, presented in the conceptual model, also 
composed by the information and material flow. 





Fig. 3. Simulation second scenario 


As described in the section 3, the second scenario firstly 
propose the application of machine learning, and them the 
real-time communication between all players of the supply 
chain to enable the anticipatory distribution process. So, the 
information flow is represented by demand information and 
by the orders, to correct the mismatch between demand and 
supply. And every time the information with demand or order 


arrives in each player the anticipatory distribution process is 
initiated at the end of the day. For that, it was considered a 
five-stage SC that include the customers/clients, 16 retailers 
in different Brazilian cities, three regional distribution centers 
in Salvador, São Paulo and Manaus, one central distribution 
center located in Goiânia, and one supplier in São Paulo. As 
show in Figure 4. 


To represent the effect of machine learning in the simulation 
model in the second scenario the consumption of some 
products was influenced by other products that have the same 
sales behavior and were associated with the same cluster, in 
order to represent the application of the clustering and 
improve the forecast. And the optimization of the 
omnichannel retail supply chain will not be applied in this 
article, but the parameters that will be included in the 
optimization process will be analysed in the simulation to 
evaluate the performance of the model. The following 
objective function terms, classified by Govindan, Fattahi and 
Keyvanshokooh (2017), that will be used are the inventory 
cost, transportation/shipment costs, transportation/shipment 
time, processing costs in facilities, fixed ordering costs, 
shortage/backorder costs and routing costs.

To represent the effect of machine learning in the simulation 
model in the second scenario the consumption of some 
products was influenced by other products that have the same 
sales behavior and were associated with the same cluster, in 
order to represent the application of the clustering and 
improve the forecast. And the optimization of the 
omnichannel retail supply chain will not be applied in this 
article, but the parameters that will be included in the 
optimization process will be analysed in the simulation to 
evaluate the performance of the model. The following 
objective function terms, classified by Govindan, Fattahi and 
Keyvanshokooh (2017), that will be used are the inventory 
cost, transportation/shipment costs, transportation/shipment 
time, processing costs in facilities, fixed ordering costs, 
shortage/backorder costs and routing costs. 


So, to represent the conceptual model in the simulation 
model, the following parameters based on Ivanov (2017) will 
be included to the simulation: the inventory control policy; 
transportation costs, computed subject to product weight and 
shipment distance, and transportation time (real routes are 
used subject to average truck speeds); fleet size; less-than-
truckload shipments are allowed; inbound and outbound

omnichannel retail supply chain is composed by the 
information and material flows. 


As can be seen in Fig 1, the information flow of the 
simulation based optimization model is the flow responsible 
for initializing the distribution process, and this can happen in 
two distinct moments. Considering that this supply chain 


share the demand forecast information, the first moment is 
from the arrival of demand forecast information, coming 
from the machine learning, and the second moment is with 
the information of the sale of products by the online and 
offline stores. 





Fig. 1. Proposed conceptual model for omnichannel retailing supply chain management. 


To represent both the anticipatory and the adaptive process 
the distribution process presented in this generic model of the 
omnichannel retail supply chain is composed by the 
information and material flows. 


As can be seen in Fig 1, the information flow of the 
simulation based optimization model is the flow responsible 
for initializing the distribution process, and this can happen in 
two distinct moments. Considering that this supply chain 
share the demand forecast information, the first moment is 
from the arrival of demand forecast information, coming 
from the machine learning, and the second moment is with 
the information of the sale of products by the online and 
offline stores. After the arrival of the demand forecast 
information, the supply chain aims to anticipate the 
distribution process to leave the product in the distribution 
center closest to the end customer, even before the sale of the 
product. Therefore, the distribution process represented by 
the material flow in Fig. 1, adopt the pushed flows from the 
supplier to the central and regional distribution centers, based 
on demand forecast information in order to reduce the lead 
time. 


From the distribution centers, the distribution process starts 
according to the sales realized by the online and offline 
channels. With the product sales, the process of information 
flow of both online and offline stores starts. In the online 
stores, the sale information is directed to the distribution 
center that will respond to the request, and in the off-line 
stores, the checking process of the availability of the product 
for sale is started. 


The checking process, who is performed by the retailer and 
regional and central distributors, is carried out with each sale, 
based on real demand, and on a monthly basis, based on 
demand forecasting. In this process, firstly is analyzed the 
necessary amount of product in stock and what’s already 
been sent to each member, that meet the real demand. If the 
store has the product, it is taken from the inventory and the 
sale is made, otherwise the member places an order request to 
the previous member to send the product. With the orders 
placed and the necessity of product identified, the material 
flow is started by the regional and central distribution center. 


The adoption of pull and push flow types in the same 
distribution process occurred so that there is a balance 
between the lead time reduction and the quantity of stocks in

processing costs and time; fixed facility and inventory 
holding costs, and production costs and product price. 


To develop the simulation in Anylogic a hybrid simulation 
will be utilized. To develop the flow between agents, 
represented in Figure 5, the discrete simulation will be adopt, 
and based on agent will be adopt to represent the logic of 
each agent as illustrated in Figure 6.

Therefore, with this model is expected to reduce lead time 
and the total cost of the omnichannel retail supply chain and 
to improve the efficiency of the supply chain and propose a 
better synchronization for demand and supply. Thereof, the 


proposed conceptual model enables managers to perform 
operations planning with more accurate data, by minimizing 
the uncertainties of demand forecasting, and allowing for a 
more responsive and adaptive decision-making of supply 
chain operations by identifying the scenario with the lower 
logistics costs and the highest level of customer service. 





5. CONCLUSIONS 


The transformation of the retail supply chain into a 
omnichannel retail supply chain in the last years are forcing 
them to become more predictive, accurate, dynamic and 
smart to deal with uncertainties, oscillations in sales volume 
and supply-demand incompatibility. 


For this reason, is extremely important to adopt intelligent 
decision methods that address the predictive issue, in which 
provides a demand forecast with greater accuracy and 
minimize uncertainties, and tools capable of analyzing 
scenarios to propose a dynamic and smart chain that reduces 
the incompatibility between demand and supplies. 


Therefore, this paper has presented a conceptual method for a 
predictive and adaptive omnichannel retail supply chain 
management by the application of the machine learning and 
the simulation based optimization in order to minimize the 
uncertainties factors and supply-demand incompatibility. 


In the machine learning two methods were proposed for the 
information flow, the clustering method to analyze the 
behavior of the consumers coming from big data, and the 
artificial neural networks method to realize the forecast of 
demand with greater accuracy. And in the simulation based 
optimization, which analyze the information, material and 
financial flow, a supply chain that use the pull and pushed 
flows, and checking process was adopted to optimize the 
costs and the lead time. 


In this way, the integration and analysis of material, financial 
and information flows through the application of machine 
learning and simulation based optimization methods in the 
omnichannel retail supply chain management enables them to 
identify and respond to the needs of consumers in a 
competitive and dynamic way. As future research, the 
practical application of this model in test scenarios to verify 
its efficiency when compared to other models presented in 
the literature is recommended.
