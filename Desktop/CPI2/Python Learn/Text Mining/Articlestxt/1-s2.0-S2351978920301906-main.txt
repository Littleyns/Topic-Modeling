Abstract 


Industry 4.0 concepts are defined around the use of new technologies for improving industrial companies according to scientific, 
technological and organizational aspects. Enterprise complex problems could be solved in this frame. Many methods and 
concepts presented in the literature are focused on these aspects. A new method is being developed in Icam Paris-Sénart around 
the idea that sustainability must be the kernel of “industry of the future”. Indeed, the framework proposed is a combination of the 
previous aspects with environmental, social and societal aspects. The actual situation of the planet is an encouragement to make 
all future transformations with sustainability as kernel. These concepts could be imported in healthcare logistics and transport 
area for solving specific problems of this domain. Icam (French Engineer school) and FEI University are collaborating for 
proposing to healthcare hospitals a new framework (healthcare logistics 4.0) for solving complex problems of this domain.  
This paper is focusing on how to improve medicines procurement and dispatching in a hospital. Indeed, the use of Artificial 
Intelligence in healthcare sector is growing up. Data treated and analyzed could give important insights for solving problems and 
improving the existing organization. As machine learning is already exploited in many production management problems 
(forecasting, storage, production, etc.), the idea is to use it for developing an aided tool in addition to a lean manufacturing 
classical approach. After presenting the real problem of medicines procurement and dispatching detected in healthcare hospitals, 
concepts of lean manufacturing and machine learning will be exposed. Then, the methodology proposed for solving the problem 
will be shown. An illustration will be given for validating concepts presented. Finally, the link with the global “Healthcare 
logistics 4.0” framework will be described.

1. Introduction 


Industry 4.0 and supply chain 4.0 concepts and tools are mainly based on new technologies (RFID, IoT, Robot, 
Cobot, decision aided tools, etc.) and organizations (Blockchain, 6 Sigma, lean manufacturing, etc.) utilization for 
changing companies and improving their performance. Indeed, the use of these concepts is important for big 
companies, but not sufficient for SMEs. Even if technological and organizational aspects are necessary for the 
company evolution, brakes for using these concepts are numerous. Some of them are related to human and 
environmental aspects. Then, a framework is being developed in Icam (School of engineering) based on 
sustainability (social, societal and environmental dimensions), around which, technological, organizational aspects 
in addition to flexibility and changes management will be elaborated for improving company performance. Icam and 
FEI (Brazilian university) are collaborating for the elaboration of Healthcare logistics 4.0 concepts and tools. Many 
healthcare logistics problems will be solved for improving the healthcare performance. This paper presents the work 
done in this frame. 


Thus, due to the high variance of diseases, patient allergies, big variety of suppliers and new medicines on the 
market an elevate number of medicines could be available in a hospital pharmacy. However, having an important 
stock implies to invest, and then immobilize proper funds, use a large space to stock these products. Indeed, this 
procurement management problem and product storage could also imply medicines expiration date problem 
management. 


Other problems are related to the process of stock replenishment. For instance, one problem is related to 
medicines purchase frequency and quantity. It is necessary to use forecasting for defining the adapted purchasing 
plan, integrating current supplier delivery time, procurement economic quantity for each product. Then, public 
hospital resources associated to the purchase process management have to be optimized.   


Finally, the main problem is about medicines procurement treatment. All products have to be managed 
simultaneously by workers. The consequence is their difficulty to organize orders, to manage products reception the 
products arrival and the storage processes. This abnormality drags the whole workflow chain, overloading 
departments and resulting in the quality service falls. The lead time management could be improved. Indeed, 
products life time have to be taken into account and an organization with mass procurement lots implies a long 
storage time and diminution of the product life time in hospital services. Due to this bad management, the storage 
cost is generally high for the pharmacy and the global process is not optimized (high waiting time, risk of 
deterioration, etc.).  


In this paper, a literature review allowing to choose concepts and tools, which could contribute to elaborate a 
solution for increasing hospital pharmacy purchasing and procurement process managements is presented. Then, 
methods (based on enterprise modelling and lean manufacturing, etc.) and concepts elaborated for improving 
purchasing and procurement processes performance will be described. Indeed, the general structure of the decision 
aided tool, based on artificial intelligence and being developed for improving healthcare purchasing and 
procurement performance will be exposed. A use case will be shown for illustrating concepts, methods and tools 
presented and perspectives of this research will be exposed.  


2. Literature review 


The project focuses on healthcare logistics 4.0. The idea is to increase ability to save lives and the global hospital 
performance by solving healthcare problems such as medicines procurement and dispatching optimization. Indeed, 
the improvement of this performance implies to use performance criteria for measuring at each step the result of 
changes introduced in the hospital. In addition to quality, cost and lead time (QCD), social, societal and 
environmental aspects have to be used for this optimization. For instance, in a manufacturing company, suppliers

have to deliver raw materials on time in order to favorize products elaboration (on time) and customer delivery time 
satisfaction. The processes of purchasing, delivering, storage and dispatching have to be increased. An analogy 
could be made between a hospital ad a company by defining customer to satisfy (patient) and performance to 
increase. Then, methods and concepts of industry 4.0 and logistics 4.0 could be used for defining specific concepts 
in the frame of healthcare logistics 4.0. For elaborating the adapted solution to the problems explained above, a 
decision aided tool will also be developed. A problem-solving method, based on a general approach, exploiting 
DMAIC, for making sustainable supply chain efficient, will be defined. Lean manufacturing and artificial 
intelligence (expert systems [1], machine learning) will be used for the development of the decision aided tool.  


2.1. Efficiency of sustainable supply chain by DMAIC approach 


DMAIC (Define, Analyze, Innovate, Control, Standardize) is a problem-solving method generally used for 
manufacturing company total quality management (TQM). This method is adapted for improving continuously 
sustainable supply chain. The idea is to reduce lead time and cost, to increase quality of the system (being studied) 
and also to optimize social, societal and environmental aspects. As explained in [2] and shown in the following 
equations, the optimum of a system performance could be obtained by combining performance criteria.  





Li is the lead time (lj is the lead time obtained by taking into account one parameter in each domain) and Oi is the 
Optimum (integrating quality Qi, cost Ci, lead time Li, and carbon management Si) associated to one part of the 
supply chain. O is the global optimum of the supply chain. The method could be used for solving healthcare 
logistics problems and for: 
• Integrating new concepts associated to information & decision management (IoT, tracking, RFID, big data 


management, decision aided tool),  
• Applying organizational methods (lean manufacturing, design of experiment (DOE), flow modelling and 


simulation),  
Then, the general approach which would be used will combine industry improvement conceptual aspects (concepts 
presented above and lean manufacturing) with real experimentation during DMAIC steps:  
• Define: complete definition of process.  
• Measure: measurement of the actual situation. 
• Analyze: analysis of the existing system and the detection of inconsistencies.  
• Innovate: experimentation improvement proposition. 
• Control: measurement of the future system and test of its impacts.  
• Standardize: making general solution sustainable and efficient (capitalization).  


This new problem-solving method will be enriched by concepts of lean manufacturing presented below. 


2.2. Lean Manufacturing 


Lean Manufacturing Methodology is a performance improvement tool developed in the frame Toyota Production 
System (TPS). It is a systemic method for minimizing non-added values, eliminating waste (7 MUDA) and focusing 
production tasks on added-values during the product elaboration. Lean manufacturing proposes to improve the 
“value” by willing what the customer would pay for. To achieve the expected outcome of Lean Projects, the effort

should be to optimize the “flow” of subjects in the system and the efficiency of any individual resource of the 
system [3]. 


In the last decade, the healthcare sector has made leapfrog advancement in adapting lean principles in healthcare 
operations, although the way that they have been implemented differs across organizations. Though, the healthcare 
sector has a record of adopting Toyota Production System principles, especially in the mainly independent US 
healthcare system. For instance, tools such as Rapid Process Improvement (RPIW), 5S, value-stream mapping 
(VSM) and Kanban were used in the Virginia Mason Medical Center, an acute care hospital in Seattle [4].  


Thus, a flow-based view suggests that a resource-efficient approach is problematic from a customer perspective 
and creates several negative effects. This view argues that a resource-based approach to efficiency generates lots of 
waste and hidden inefficiency. The focus is on the flow unit which moves through the organization. “Flow 
efficiency” measures how well a flow unit moves through all processes across the operations context. In this context 
of healthcare operations, the flow unit is the individual patient who arrives to the hospital [5]. 


2.3. Machine learning 


The framework developed for healthcare logistics 4.0 (with sustainability as the kernel) and the global approach 
encourage the development of a decision aided tool, for solving procurement and dispatching problems, but also for 
integrating new technologies and organizations in the hospital performance improvement process (patient 
satisfaction and increasing of hospital performance). This tool being developed is based on artificial intelligence 
concepts, methods and tools. Indeed, expert systems, multi-agent systems [6], [7], machine learning and CBR (Case-
Based Reasoning) are adapted for solving healthcare logistics problems.  


Trough the last decade, the acceptance of new formalisms like neural networks and data mining methodologies 
for solving problems has grown up. Different applications of this concepts could be found in the literature, and tools 
have been developed in forecasting, modelling, simulation, clustering, classification domains. Then, various 
formalisms were developed such as swarm intelligence [8], neural networks [9], convolutional neural network, Deep 
learning [10], machine learning [11], etc.  


The main difference between neural networks and statistical approaches is that neural networks make no 
assumption about the statistical distribution or data properties, and therefore, tend to be more useful in practical 
situations. Neural networks are also an inherently nonlinear approach giving them much accuracy for modelling 
complex data patterns. 


Artificial intelligence forecasting techniques have the ability to learn like humans, by accumulating knowledge 
through repetitive learning activities.  


Therefore, the objective of this paper is to propose medicines procurement and dispatching improvement in a 
hospital. In this frame, the Artificial Neural Network (figure 1) method could be used.

Therefore, the objective of this paper is to propose medicines procurement and dispatching improvement in a 
hospital. In this frame, the Artificial Neural Network (figure 1) method could be used.

Artificial neural networks (ANN) were developed for simulating the animal brain’s cognitive learning process. 
However, in the past decade, they also attracted substantial attention in business industry. ANNs are proved to be 
efficient for modeling (complex and poorly understood) problems on which sufficient data are collected [12]. ANN 
is a technology that has been mainly used for prediction, clustering, classification, and alerting to abnormal patterns 
[13]. The ability to learn with examples is probably the most important property of neural networks applications and 
can be used to train a neural network with the record of past response of a complex system [14], [15]. 


The integration of these formalisms in the development of the decision aided tool will increase the efficiency of 
the tool in coherence with new technologies exploitation, and finally in healthcare performance increasing [15]. 


3. Methods and concepts 


Methods, concepts and tools of industry 4.0 and logistics 4.0 are used for elaborating healthcare 4.0 concepts. 
They allow to integrate new technologies and organizations (in addition to flexibility) for satisfying patient 
expectations. For instance, robot and cobot are already used for aiding doctors in their daily operations. AGVs are 
already used for following nurses during their work and aiding them for transporting medicines for patients. Indeed, 
the framework being developed in Icam in collaboration with FEI University is based on sustainability as the kernel 
of healthcare 4.0 [16].  


Thus, patients have to be at the center of all changes in the hospital. The quality of their treatment, comfort and 
efficiency of healthcare services are main objectives. Then, workers well-being and serenity have to be taken into 
account for increasing the global hospital efficiency. The framework elaborated proposes to combine technological 
aspects with these visions around sustainability (social (patients & workers), societal (which society for tomorrow), 
and environmental (how to protect our earth) aspects).  


The idea is to define a reference model for healthcare logistics. This model could be used for implementing 
healthcare logistics for the future in hospitals. This implementation is obtained by transforming progressively the 
hospital (figure 2).  





Figure 2: Framework for healthcare logistics 4.0 concepts implementation 


Then, the focus on procurement and dispatching service will allow to optimize flows and to solve problems 
currently met in a hospital. The decision aided tool being developed in Icam will be used for aiding workers in order 
to be daily efficient, to satisfy patients expectations and to increase healthcare performance.  


3.1. The decision aided tool 


The tool being developed has to aid workers for procurement and dispatching optimization. Then the proposed 
structure is elaborated for solving problems and aiding globally workers to increase healthcare logistics 
performance. The decision aided tool (figure 3) is composed of: 


6 Author name / Procedia Manufacturing  00 (2019) 000–000 


• A knowledge base  
• An expert knowledge acquisition system 
• An inference motor 
• A stock optimizer 
• A learning system 
• A capitalization system 
• A calculator & evaluator motor  
• And a user interface 





Figure 3: decision aided tool for healthcare 4.0 concepts implementation in hospitals 


3.1.1. Databases 
Databases are most important components in the decision aided tool as the hearth of the system. Indeed, they are 


present in the Capitalization System for recording old cases. In this module, a CBR manager also ensures the 
process of old cases reuse for aiding users to solve a new problem. They are also used in the existing system for 
acquiring data on the new case. In the expert system, the knowledge base contains three data bases for managing 
respectively initial facts, inferred facts and rules. The last module using a base is the expert knowledge management 
system for introducing expert new knowledge in the aided tool. The tool will have enough knowledge stocked in the 
data base.  


3.1.2. Inference motor 
The inference machine is the kernel of the expert system. It is used for creating interaction with facts and rules 


bases. Data stocked in theses bases would be extracted for analyzing the new case and solving problems. Basically, 
it is a protocol for navigating inside the database trough rules aiming to solve the problem. 


3.1.3. User Interface 
The user interface is the convivial connection with employees. New data could be entered in the system by this 


way for being analyzed and for defining adapted solutions to problems. Then, the system will also give response to 
users. The user interface creates interaction between employees and the system. It is the place where employees will 
check medicines lists and engineers will access to the configuration. 


3.1.4. Stock Optimizer 
The stock optimizer is the place where the software will reach out to apply stock rules and algorithms. This 


module is destined to manage stock and adapt medicines procurement to storage dimensions, but also to patient

needs. The idea is to calculate for each product the optimal procurement time and the economic quantity. For main 
management rules are used in priority according to procurement frequency and quantity. 


3.1.5. Learning System 
The Learning System utilizes the Artificial Neural Network for forecasting the demand and the formula 


adaptation by learning with data available. Each data integrated in the tool by expert would increase the learning 
system knowledge and improve its performance. 


 
This tool being developed will be tested on real cases for improving concepts used in the general approach and 


validating algorithms developed in the tool.  


4. Illustration 


The illustration concerns the use of healthcare logistics 4.0 methods and concepts for solving procurement and 
dispatching problems of a hospital.  


DMAIC method (combined with lean manufacturing and industry 4.0 concepts) represents the general 
methodology used for solving problems of this hospital. Each step of DMAIC was used during the project and lean 
manufacturing has contributed to detect inconsistencies and waste in the process (elimination of non-added values). 
For instance, during the ‘Define’ step the modeling of the existing system was done by exploiting Value Stream 
Mapping (VSM) method. Then, for the ‘Measure’ and ‘Analyze’ steps, lean manufacturing (MUDA) was used. For 
instance, the hospital didn’t have place for storing all products. A delay was also noticed every time in the medicines 
dispatching process. The direct impact is that product availability durations were reduced for patient use. The global 
procurement cost of the pharmacy was high due to the quantity of storage and the global performance was low 
because of disturbing dispatching flows organization. So, the decision tool was used for aiding employees in their 
daily tasks focused on procurement process management and dispatching flows optimization.  


The replenishes medicines process is an important process in the hospital pharmacy. However, its impact in the 
workflow is underestimated. Therefore, the replenishes process should be done every week, fulfilling the right 
medicines at the good time. 


The software (a decision aided tool) was used for aiding the stock manager in the order elaboration. Then, rules 
such as ‘the user interface allows the employee to ask for the best order solution’ should be applied. Every time, the 
user could consult replenishes medicines lists. The Inference Motor controls medicines stock status furnished 
products stock level and proposed order solutions.  


In the stock optimizer system, there is a procurement forecasting historic which is constantly analyzed. This 
historic compares the consumption per day for defining the adapted solution.  Artificial Neural networks contributed 
to elaborate estimated order quantities (figure 4).  





Figure 4: Replenishes medicines module 


Then, the Inference Motor relates medicines needs with stock management rules. Quantities needed to fulfill the 
stock should be defined by the Stock Optimizer. Thus, the variation of quantities was enabled according to a specific 
moment of the year, ensuring a better adaptability of stock level and creating new data to integrate in the learning 
system.

Finally, the software tool had furnished to user quantities (required) for optimizing the process, restrictions values 
(lot size, supplier, urgency etc.) and appropriated replenishes medicines list. This list aims to facilitate the 
replenishment without causing a disturbance in the hospital workflow. 


The deployment of Healthcare logistics 4.0 concept (being elaborated) in the hospital and the test of the decision 
aided tool process allow to show pertinence and efficiency of both methods and tools in the hospital logistics 
improvement.  


5. Conclusion 


This paper presents Healthcare logistics 4.0 concepts (being developed). They are based on a combination of 
DMAIC, Lean Manufacturing, with Industry 4.0 concepts. Then, the structure of the decision aided tool being 
developed (for aiding workers in their tasks) in order to optimize procurement and dispatching processes is shown. 
The specificity of the learning system and the stock optimizer (based on Artificial Neural Networks) is exposed. The 
importance of a good management of stock levels in a hospital and its impact in the workflow cadency, is pointed 
out. Difficulties for implementing an efficient management model are presented.  


The illustration (exposed in this paper) explains how the working tool being developed would be able to improve 
the time spent in the replenishes process. For instance, it would provide an easy and complete view of stocks.  


The methodology explained will allow to combine main performance criteria as quality, cost, lead time, with 
social, societal and environmental aspects for increasing healthcare logistics performance. The reduction of storage 
quantity will reduce cost but also increase product quality. The dispatching flows optimization and suggestions to 
users will reduce lead time and increase worker ergonomics and efficiency. They will contribute to reduce waste and 
avoid doing non valuable operations.  


The beta version of the decision aided tool is being elaborated, based on concepts presented previously. The 
development of the beta version is ongoing. Then, real efficient of the tool will be tested by increasing the number 
of experimentations on hospitals.
