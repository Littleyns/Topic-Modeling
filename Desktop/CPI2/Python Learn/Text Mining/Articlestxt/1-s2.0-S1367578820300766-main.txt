The concept of digital ecosystem (DES) is widely used in autonomous manufacturing process control and the 
development of complex, stable, interactive, self-organizing and reliable management systems for various in-
dustries. The paper offers a concept of DES control system architecture based on predictive models. For esti-
mating and predicting the state of resources in production processes, an approach is developed using data mining 
based model generation. The paper also reviews the current state of research in the field of DES and their ap-
plications in supply chain management (SCM).   


Introduction 


The development of information technologies and their widespread 
dissemination to various sectors of economy resulted in new business 
models and, eventually, additional benefits (Akram, 2015). In process-
ing and power industries, competitive advantages of enterprises 
currently rest upon both state-of-the-art production technologies and the 
advanced production management underpinned by wide capabilities of 
modern IT. A key role is assigned to fast and efficient processing of 
digital information, in particular, its exchange between production 
management systems and levels (plant floor, MES, ERP, etc.). 
Cluster-network production systems with horizontal linkages are 
becoming predominant. 


The recent years of production management development in industry 
have seen the evolution of digital platforms, in particular, the enhance-
ment of their functionality (Babiolakis, 2020),Companies create their 
products, which can be used by other companies for creating new 
products based on their own services. This approach contributed to the 
quantum growth of Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, AirBnB, and 
other major IT companies. However, the authors note, a new era has 
arisen: the creation of digital ecosystems. 


Currently, there are certain discrepancies in the literature about the 
definition of a digital ecosystem (Chang & West, 2006; Dong, Hussain, & 
Chang, 2007; Nachira, Dini, & Nicolai, 2007; (Baker and Bowker, 2007), 
(Saleh and Abel, 2016); Fuller, 2007; (Papaioannou et al., 2009)). 


High-growth companies don’t go it alone. Increasingly, they are 


achieving results by creating and orchestrating digitally connected 
ecosystems – coordinated networks of enterprises, devices, and cus-
tomers – that create value for all of their participants (Sebastian, Weill, 
& Woerner, 2020). 


Taking into account the variety of definitions, we will further un-
derstand a digital ecosystem (DES) as a distributed sociotechnical sys-
tem with the properties of self-organization, stability, and adaptability 
and the elements (automated systems and economic entities) competing 
against and/or cooperating with each other. DES brings together 
autonomous participants who share resources and expertise for collab-
orative development of products with the overall economic value larger 
than the ones developed outside the DES. 


In view of the technological, economic and organizational autonomy 
of DES participants, its operation on the basis of a computer network 
infrastructure using intelligent control technologies, in particular, multi- 
agent ones (Rzevski, 2019) looks quite natural for the following reasons. 
The increasing information density and complexity of various produc-
tion problems solved in real time at different levels (process control, 
production scheduling and logistics, resource management and re-
lationships within suppliers and consumers) make it natural to move 
from rigid hierarchical verticals of management organization to cluster 
network patterns. Ensuring the system stability in a dynamically un-
stable environment (e.g., economic) as well as its sustainable develop-
ment are the tasks of paramount importance. 


DES can not only improve the efficiency of control and make it more 
transparent for all stakeholders, but also generate new services able to

evolve as a separate ecosystem and interact with other external 
ecosystems. 


This is especially important for the operation of supply chain (SC) 
management. Digitalization results in the emergence of DES in SC 
ensuring the integrity, transparency, monitoring, and controllability of 
the entire product life cycle from supplier selection to manufacturing to 
warehousing to distribution to shipment up to the end user (Ivanov, 
Sethi, Dolgui, & Sokolov, 2018). SC are complex organisms, and effictive 
organization of their interaction to ensure transparency, flexibility and 
scalability of their architecture is important. A variety of effective supply 
chain management (SCM) models and methods are presented in Dolgui, 
Ivanov, and Rozhkov (2018, 2020), Ivanov (2020), Ivanov and Dolgui 
(2020), (Dolgui & Ivanov, 2020; Ivanov, Tang, Dolgui, Battini, & Das, 
2020); Panetto, Iung, Ivanov, Weichhart, and Wang (2019), Sokolov 
et al. (2020). 


The paper (Ivanov, 2020) proposed a SC ecosystem framework. The 
paper (Ivanov & Dolgui, 2020) offered a digital framework. 


This article offers a new framework combining both concepts. The 
authors discuss the design concept and development methodology of 
DES architecture for SCM systems. Despite the wide-ranging discussion 
of DES design and development in numerous forums and a growing 
number of publications, the problems of developing the structure and 
semantics of DES control systems has not been resolved as yet. Against 
this background, this article addresses the problem of developing the 
concept and architecture of such systems. It looks promising to create 
DES control systems based on real-time predictive models, which are 
developed and adjusted based on big data mining approach. This should 
require the processing of large data amounts; the acceleration may be 
attained owing to big data technics such as batch data uploading or in- 
memory computing. 


Based on the survey of 400 companies conducting digital trans-
formation, the analysts from Capgemini Consulting and MIT Sloan 
School of Management have ascertained (Westerman, Tannou, Bonnet, 
Ferraris, & McAfee, 2012) that: 


• conservative companies focusing on management improvement in-
crease their profit by 9% but could potentially gain three times more 
with digital technologies;  


• organizations investing heavily in digital technology but paying little 
attention to management demonstrate financial performance 11% 
less than possible at the same level of digitalization. 


KAMAZ PJSC (Tatarstan, Russia) sets a good example. This major 
vehicle and truck manufacturer has increased its sales by 21% within a 
year since the digital transformation began. The company established a 
specialized “Digital Transformation Center” to underpin the following 
projects: creation of a logistics department; development of a moni-
toring and operational production control system (in collaboration with 
Siemens); transformation of the sales business model into a system of 
customer interaction based on the SAP Hybris Cloud for Customer 
platform. Further integration of these and other company’s digital 
transformation fragments into a balanced integrated management sys-
tem is a paramount task. Another example is given by Fiat which de-
clares the possibility of creating "smart cars" on its own Uconnect digital 
platform in collaboration with popular customer service companies: 
TomTom, Reuters, Facebook, TuneIn. It can be concluded, that for these 
and many other enterprises that successfully carry out digital trans-
formation of their activities, it is equally important to establish man-
agement and control based on the “information benefits” provided by 
the digitalization. 


The digital transformation of industrial enterprises and the creation 
of digital platforms is not an end in itself. When a system has a wide 
range of DES operation data and the ability to quickly process and 
efficiently store large amounts of this data, there appear the possibilities 
of efficient detailed analysis, forecasting for control, scheduling and 
planning. This may include also scenario forecasting and situational 


management. Optimality can be understood both in terms of production 
and finance. 


To optimize DES management we propose the concept of identifi-
cation analysis that presumes the use of models (including predictive 
ones) of various DES fragments for real-time control. Real-time identi-
fication models are embedded directly into automatic control systems 
and decision support systems at such levels as process control, planning 
and resource management, production logistics systems and relation-
ships with feedstock and component suppliers product consumers, 
product management and services throughout their lifecycle (PLM / 
SLM). 


In fact, we propose to create control systems for DES on the basis on 
their detailed digital descriptions (digital twins). The article presents the 
architecture of such control systems; the architecture reflects the pos-
sibility of control based on digital predictive models. In general, a DES 
control system can currently employ: calculation models for various 
processes and technical characteristics; modern simulation models; 
identification models based on data mining. 


We focus on developing predictive identification models. In terms of 
DES, these models use various data types (with numerical values and 
categorical), therefore we propose to use the model data fusion tech-
nology and data coding. 


The article focuses on two key aspects of DES control system:  


• development of models that can be tuned using real-time Big Data 
Mining,  


• creating a system architecture that provides stream processing of big 
data, data fusion, flexible scalability, and the ability to balanced 
management of all subsystems and the DES as a whole. The accel-
eration may be attained owing to in-memory computing. 


Intelligent identification predictive models for DES 


We propose to develop control systems for DES on the basis of model 
predictive control (MPC) technology (Qin & Badgwell, 2003a,b). In the 
recent years, MPC systems have become the most popular class of con-
trol systems for complex objects with many interconnections, time lags, 
nonlinearities, and constraints. MPC rests upon the inclusion of the 
object model into the control loop. Model structure and/or parameters 
may be updated from time to time. MPC technology belongs to a more 
generic control philosophy named Advanced Process Control (APC). 


However, the increased requirements for speed, accuracy and control 
capabilities under uncertainty conditions and various kinds of distur-
bances in production control systems have demonstrated the drawbacks 
of traditional MPC approaches (Ratner, 2017). Moreover, conventional 
MPC algorithms solve an optimization problem at each time step thus 
consuming significant computing power, especially for control objects of 
large dimension. 


At the same time, real-time identification models of dynamic objects 
developed on the basis of e-learning with reference to the patterns 
extracted from historical and current process data have demonstrated 
their high efficiency. These patterns are called inductive knowledge 
(Vapnik, 1998). Most of the calculations are carried out at the system 
learning stage thus ensuring high performance of the on-line identifi-
cation algorithm embedded in the control loop. 


For developing on-line predictive models for DES, we propose to use 
the associative search algorithm. It belongs to the type described above 
and has demonstrated high accuracy over a wide range of objects 
((Bakhtadze and Lototsky, 2016), including nonlinear ones. A featured 
property of this identification algorithm is the development of a new 
linear model at each time step. The algorithm is, in fact, the imple-
mentation of a “smart” least squares method. From the whole set of 
historical data accumulated up to the current moment t, only a part is 
selected which meets a certain criterion. Further on, the solution of the 
corresponding system of linear equations determines the coefficients of 
the current linear model. At the next time step, the procedure recurs: a

new linear model is built, etc. 
For time-varying objects, identification by the associative search 


method is carried out in the wavelet transform space. The stability 
conditions were obtained in the form of restrictions imposed on the 
wavelet spectrum. This approach enables, in particular, effective pre-
diction of various emergency situations thus ensuring the operation 
stability and safety of production DES. 


Predicting the state of the DES resource complex 


A paramount task in large-scale DES management is predicting the 
state of its resource complex (Bakhtadze et al., 2018). The assessment 
and prediction of the state of production resources increase the flexi-
bility of operational management and allow to anticipate the situations 
when the execution of the production plan might be problematic or 
impossible. We will further call these situations abnormal. 


However, the key indicators of the production system (industrial 
enterprise or company) are not always expressed numerically that im-
pedes the application of identification methods, including the intelligent 
ones. For example, the states of some equipment pieces may take on the 
values: “working” or “not working”, “normal” or “not normal”, etc. One 
can characterize similarly the state of human resources which also 
belong to the DES resource complex. To overcome the challenge, the 
identification models allowing for such binary indicators should be 
object-specific. 


Moreover, traditional identification algorithms for multidimensional 
models assume that some indicators are statistically independent of each 
other. However, in real complex systems, this is seldom the case: 
abnormal situation precursors (characterized by a certain state of one or 
several resources) may look like the values of some set of indicators 
several time steps before the current one. 


It therefore seems reasonable that the algorithms predicting the state 
of a complex of various production resources are based on the well- 
known data mining technique named the search for association rules 
(Agrawal & Srikant, 1994). 


Taking into account that the available DES resources may be 
described in different ways (their states can be numerical or binary) and 
abide by different operation standards, it is proposed to develop unified 
digital models that make it possible to predict production situation as a 
whole. Such an algorithm would use knowledge bases and search for 
specially formed association rules for a given production process. 


Further discussion will comprise not only processes but also 
manufacturing execution systems (MES), SCM, etc. Enterprise resource 
scheduling will be also included. 


Binary coding of production resource complex state 


To apply the association rules algorithm, all production resources 
with either numerical or binary state description will be further encoded 
as binary chains. 


The term “production resources” will hereinafter mean the 
following:  


• input flows characterized by formal properties dependent on pro-
duction specificity  


• production equipment 


dij,i = 1,…,N; j = 1,…,M,


where i is the number of production equipment piece used for per-
forming the jth operation;  


• human resources 


hsj,s = 1,…, S; j = 1,…,M,


involved in the j-the operation; s is the number of human resources;  
• other factors 


fkj,k = 1,…,F; j = 1,…,M,


affecting the jth operation such as utilities and a variety of formal 
indices and factors related with the production process. 


Production resources may be described in different ways.  


• Some have qualitative characteristics which take on specific values 
that may be checked against standards at any moment.  


• The state of others such as certain equipment pieces may be 
described as either “working” or “not working”. The remaining life 
time may be known or not for such resources. The process historian 
may however keep failure statistics for a specific equipment piece; 
maintenance downtime statistics may be also available.  


• One more resource type (including human resources) is not subject to 
maintenance. In case of outage, such resources should be immedi-
ately replaced from the backlog. The replacement process is typically 
fast; therefore, no values other than 1 (OK) and 0 (not OK) should be 
assigned to such resource. 


Assume a model of a specific manufacturing situation as a dynamic 
schedule fragment comprises the following components: 


rij(t) = { < С1 >< С2 >< С3 >< С4 >< С5 > }ijt,


where: 


< С1 > =
def


< ijt > is a resource identifier including the resource 
number, the operation number and the time stamp (the number of 
characteristics may be increased). 


Other components of the resource state vector at the time step t may 
be represented by a binary code. 


< С2 > is the code of the numerical value of a state variable; for each 
of the above-listed resource types, this code is different. 


< С3 >, < С4 >, and < С5 > will be discussed further. 
First of all, we consider the resources whose state may be described 


by some quantitative characteristic such as temperature or pressure for 
chemical processes or average equipment failure. 


The solution to the problem described above is based on the possi-
bility of representing numerical values of resource state’s characteristics 
as a set of nested self-similar structures (Bakhtadze et al., 2018). 


For a specific resource, we assume that the characteristic of its state 
possesses the values on the half-interval [0; 1) (this half-interval was 
chosen as an example for simplicity, the results can be easily spread to 
any other one). This half-interval can be represented as the union [0; 
0.5)∪[0.5; 1), see Fig. 1. 


We will further correspond the symbols {0; 1} to the left and right 
half-intervals respectively, namely, 0 to the left half-interval, and 1 to 
the right one. Each of the two subintervals can be further split in the 


Fig. 1. A code for the numerical value of a quantity on the half-interval [0;1).  


N. Bakhtadze and A. Suleykin

same way, and, again, the values 0 and 1 can be assigned to the left and 
the right parts respectively. 


In that way, a finite chain of symbols from {0; 1} has a one-to-one 
correspondence with a half-interval embedded in [0; 1). For example, 
the chain 00 corresponds to [0; 0.25), and the chain 100 to [0.5; 0.625) 
respectively. For a binary partition, the chain of n symbols corresponds 
to a half-interval with the length 12n. 


Thus, for each value of a numerical characteristic at the current 
instant we obtain a binary code. The number of digits, as we show 
further, will determine the prediction accuracy. 


For the resources from the categories 2 and 3, the respective codes 
will have the same value (either 1 or 0) in all digits. 


〈С3〉 in (1) is the code of the time before the maintenance end. If a 
resource is available and operated, the respective code consists of ones. 


〈С4〉 is the code of the time before the equipment piece fails with the 
probability close to 1 (remaining life). 


In the scheduling practice, this time is not less than the operating 
time. However, resource replacement during the operation may be 
sometimes more cost-effective. Moreover, the equipment piece may fail 
unexpectedly. 


For resource types from categories 1 and 3, 〈С4〉 has ones in all po-
sitions. 


〈С5〉 is the time before the scheduled end of the operation. In real-life 
manufacturing situations, the time may be lost (with the need in 
schedule update) for the reasons neither stipulated in the production 
model nor caused by equipment failures. Generally, it is hardly possible 
to formalize all such causes of schedule disruption. Therefore, their 
consolidation as the “remaining plan execution time” is a way to allow 
for those hidden factors in the production state model. 


Thus, for each resource with reference to a specific production 
operation, we have defined a binary code with its specific time identi-
fier. By combining resource codes with equal values of this identifier, we 
obtain a description of the manufacturing situation at the current time 
step (from the viewpoint of the state of resources). To a great extent 
(under the assumption of insignificant influence of external factors on 
the system) this state determines the possibility of plan execution ac-
cording to the schedule. 


Resource state prediction for production processes by means of associative 
rules 


For the developed binary chain, a forecast may be obtained using 
data mining techniques. It makes sense to apply the methods named 
association rules search, (not to be confused with associative search 
technique, (Bakhtadze and Lototsky, 2016), where:  


(i) associations of dynamic system states are developed with the help 
of a database and cluster analysis,  


(ii) parameter values are further calculated by means of least square 
method,  


(iii) the system’s output is finally predicted. 


The association rules search allows to:  


• reveal the hidden statistical relationship between the state of various 
resources at different time steps without any preliminary statistical 
analysis,  


• operate with state variables of various resources differing in their 
characteristics and the ways of formalization. 


The forecast of a state described by a binary chain with an identifier 
can be obtained by revealing the most probable combination of two 
binary sets of values at some fixed time step and at the next one (in a 
one-step forecast). A more distant prediction horizon is also possible. 


Thus, the most statistically probable sets of resource state values are 


identified for future time steps, provided that they took certain values at 
the previous ones. 


Supply chain management digital ecosystem 


To ensure sustainable development of the production DES and ach-
ieve a competitive advantage, it is not enough to guarantee the optimal 
management of key production processes at the enterprise and the states 
of its resources. It is also necessary to examine the entire added value 
chain, including the meeting points of various production phases. 
Moreover, taking into account the peculiarities of modern digital in-
frastructures for production management, the processes of design, 
planning and implementation of SCM tools are becoming increasingly 
important because such tools ensure maximum synergy of internal and 
inter-organizational integration and coordination within the industrial 
business DES. 


Managing production and business DES in terms of SC operation 
organization poses a serious challenge that cannot be surmounted 
without developing an effective, scalable, and fault-tolerant decentral-
ized architecture of such systems. 


The concept of supply chain DES 


The concept of SC DES was formulated in different ways (Seuring, 
2012). In (Sidra, Kanhere, & Raja, 2018), the term ecosystem is used as a 
unit of analysis in the description of supplier groups and distribution 
chains, which are understood as free groups of organizations involved in 
the creation and delivery of products and services. 


The same term is used by Iansiti and Levien (2004) for describing 
“strategy as ecology”. The concept of value creation is defined in 
(Porter, 1985) as a vertical chain extending from resource supplier to 
firms and buyers of goods and services from these firms. In this context, a 
value chain is a collection of actors, resources, and processes that alto-
gether represent the product processing stages and a set of services. In 
Markus and Loebbecke (2013), the term “ecosystem” is used as a unit of 
analysis when describing groups of suppliers and distribution chains, 
which are understood as free groups of organizations involved in the 
creation and delivery of products and services. 


Basic and auxiliary activity types are discerned. The primary activity 
is related directly with product or service creation or delivery. The 
supply chain extends the internal value chain of a company for external 
cooperation and the exchange of raw materials, products, services, and 
knowledge with other participants. 


The emergence of DES produces the reconfiguration of value crea-
tion. In Pagani (2013), three types of “constellations of control points” 
are described, which “represent three models of the topology of the 
participants in the chain: a closed vertically integrated model, a loosely 
coupled coalition model, and a multilateral platform model”. 


A new topological model emerges around major players striving for 
the dominance in the global market and overstep industry boundaries. 
This model is formed by business communities which include large or-
ganizations and their DES. In Averian (2017), the author discusses “a 
global evolutionary trend towards a supply chain driven by digital 
ecosystems” and describes the general concept of supply chain devel-
opment and the place of DES in it. 


In Walsh and Wellman (1999), a distributed supply chain model 
based on multi-agent technology is proposed. In Walsh and Wellman 
(2003), the delivery chain objective was formulated in terms of a 
network of task dependencies. Equilibrium and convergence issues are 
studied on the basis of a mathematical model; the results may be applied 
for developing a delivery chain in the automotive industry. Roto and 
Heikkilä (2017), focuses on the investigation of value creation in digital 
supply chains for organizations included in the research program that 
combines all theoretical research and implements a fully autonomous 
supply chain from the factory to the client company. 


In this article, we propose to build an industrial DES control system

for SC that differs from existing solutions. Based on Lambda-Driven 
architectural concepts (Suleykin & Panfilov, 2019), effective practices 
of intelligent identification and big data techniques and applications 
such as Transport Railway industry (Panfilov, et al., 2019), (Suleykin 
and Panfilov, 2019), telecom (Suleykin, Panfilov, & Bakhtadze, 2019), 
and power industries (Suleykin et al., 2019a), a set of digital agents and 
their interconnections is proposed for industrial SCM systems. 


The proposed DES comprises of digital infrastructure, i.e., a set of 
digital agents, which have properties of self-organization, reliability, 
fault-tolerance, decentralization and demonstrate high SCM data pro-
cessing capacity due to the nature of the underlying components and 
technologies. The proposed set of agents and their properties applied to 
SCM makes a framework for batch and real-time machine learning 
models development, tuning and implementation, that makes the pro-
posed DES unique and different from existing platforms, models, tech-
niques, which are typically focused on solving a specific SCM task (such 
as route optimization, selection of suppliers etc.) and the development a 
custom model. 


Commercial digital supply chain platforms 


Commercial digital platforms available in the global market are, in 
fact, supply chain DES. 


Oracle Transportation Management (OTM) included in Oracle Lo-
gistics suite is just an example of such platform for managing all trans-
portation activities in the supply chain. OTM supports both 
transportation companies and logistics service providers, it addresses all 
transportation activities in the global supply chain. The software re-
duces freight costs, optimizes service levels and automates the processes 
thus improving the overall logistics efficiency (www.tadviser.ru/Orac 
le_Transportation_Management_ (OTM)). 


Cargo Stream (www.cargostream.net/) gives another example. This 
independent pan-European platform coordinates the actions of shippers, 
logistics service providers and multimodal terminals thus optimizing 
transportation routes. Shippers communicate their regular shipping 
needs. The optimization tool anonymizes this data and makes it avail-
able to approved optimizers. The optimizers analyze, optimize, and 
launch approved providers to generate proposals that would satisfy all 
shippers. Once a solution is attained, the providers upload order 
fulfillment updates to the platform to update the information with the 
respective shippers. 


One more example is PwC Australia, Australian Chamber of Com-
merce and Industry (ACCI), and the Port of Brisbane have been devel-
oping a blockchain-based solution to improve supply chain efficiency. 
The solution is named the Trade Community System. 


All the listed platforms are mostly transaction-oriented and automate 
business processes. They do not provide such SCM infrastructure for 
real-time and batch machine learning models development and imple-
mentation. Moreover, they are vendor-specific, and the data exchange 
between the SCM and external DES environment is very complicated. 


Blockchain technologies for a supply chain 


Blockchain is a distributed database that contains and updates in-
formation about transactions of system participants as a chain of blocks 
(Saberi et al., 2019). 


The recent years have seen the growth in the number of blockchain 
projects such as:  


• blockchain technology for the execution of Mercedes-Benz contract 
documentation (together with Icertis),  


• TradeLens, a collaborative Maersk and IBM project,  
• a secure supply system for the aerospace and defense industry 


(Accenture and Thales, UK),  
• etc. 


Many known IT companies and startups initiate promising pilot 
projects, such as (Barata et al., 2018): 


• Walmart’s application for verifying the authenticity of trade trans-
actions as well as the accuracy and efficiency of record keeping;  


• Maersk and IBM tool for cross-border transactions between parties 
that use blockchain technology to improve process efficiency;  


• Samsung Electronics blockchain system to manage the company’s 
huge global supply chain, developed by its subsidiary Samsung SDS;  


• Blockchain-based food supplies tracking solution developed by 
Provenance, a British startup. 


The following areas demonstrate the clearest efficiency improvement 
owing to blockchain technology:  


• reduction of logistics costs, minimization of its share in the cost of 
goods, elimination of intermediaries;  


• less loss from unfair business practices or invalid shipping contracts;  
• automation of basic business processes. Although SCM systems can 


currently process large and complex datasets, many such processes 
are still slow, especially at lower levels of supply;  


• increased transparency. Growing regulatory and consumer demand 
for information on product provenance drives change. Moreover, 
improved transparency also increases product value by reducing 
excess or unexpected quality-related costs such as recall, damage to 
reputation, or loss of revenue from counterfeit or grey market goods. 
Simplifying a complex supply base opens up additional opportunities 
for value creation;  


• formation of confidential SC;  
• reduction of legal and transport costs for shippers;  
• lower IT transactions cost across the supply chain. 


Digital supply chain business model 


The supply of a digital supply chain is to produce and deliver the 
product to the client as quickly as possible, yet in a responsible and 
reliable way, while using automation to increase efficiency and reduce 
costs. This goal can only be attained once the supply chain functions as a 
reliable and efficient network of suppliers, production, logistics, ware-
housing, and customers (Alicke, Rachor, & Seyfert, 2016). 


With modern integration format, the signals that trigger events in 
supply chains can originate from anywhere in the network and alert to 
all problems affecting supply or demand, such as shortages of feedstock, 
materials, components, finished or intermediate products, or spare 
parts. Such organization of production processes is especially effective in 
flexible, in particular, custom production, which is rapidly gaining 
popularity (as well as the increasing customer demands and 
expectations). 


Effective communication is a major key to success for any SC. 
Traditional supply chains is fraught with complications caused primarily 
by the lack of complete and timely information. Sudden changes in 
demand, shortages of raw materials, and other incidents pose high risk 
of disrupting the supply chain schedule. 


That is why the main goal of a digital supply chain is to put the 
supply network on public display, to make it transparent for all partic-
ipants. This goal can be attained by developing a drastically new system 
architecture that ensures horizontal scaling and fast processing of het-
erogeneous, asynchronously incoming big data.

components shown in Fig. 2. 
The main sources of data for DES are various transactional systems, 


such as ERP, CRM, SRM, or WMS, which provide data about suppliers, 
consumers, planned production resources, stock balances, planned de-
livery times, etc. The data are transmitted through the corporate data 
bus to the messaging layer in accordance with the pub / sub model (pub 
/ sub means “publisher–subscriber”; it is a message transfer template, in 
which messages are divided into classes and do not contain information 
about their subscriber. The templates can then be used to create real- 
time e-learning models). 


At the visualization and decision-making level, the data are available 
for suppliers, consumers, and everyone else interested in process effi-
ciency and transparency, such as production and warehouse managers, 
etc. At this level, operational, near-term, and strategic management and 
decision-making support based on data analysis are carried out. These 
can be decisions on changing production schedules, the volume of in-
ventory in warehouses, the number of suppliers, customers, etc. 


All decisions at this level affect directly the plans and records for 
customer and supplier orders by changing the corresponding plans and 
records in source systems. 


Model of the extended architecture of DES information flows interaction 


An extended DES model in supply chains features the transition to 
full digitalization in all components of the architecture. Such systems 
must have the following characteristics:  


• The ability to receive data from internal and external sources, 
including tracking the device transport and social listening placed on 
a single platform;  


• Aggregated and cross-referenced data, such as supply chain events 
affecting the supply proposal. Relevant information can be extracted 
from weather monitoring data, traffic and news feeds, as well as 
social networks;  


• This “enriched” information is then “linked” within the platform and 
placed using additional analytical and simulation algorithms that 
perform strategic optimization at various levels. This information 
should go to the control block where control signals are generated on 
the basis of intelligent predictive models, system state analysis, and 
predicting techniques, as well as the algorithms for control logistics 
activities;  


• As a result, a “single source of truth” allows companies to optimize 
their choices in various conditions, using all available information to 


alert businesses, warehouses, and customers about various risks and 
to participate in actions that reduce those risks. Monitoring the status 
of transport units and anticipated external influences during order 
execution, as well as the ability to change plans in real time, are 
useful for companies leveraging their supply chains to achieve 
competitive advantages and to manage tighter the risks associated 
with their supply chains. 


Based on the proposed approach to managerial decision-making 
support, the corresponding actions will be more effective and justified. 


The “visibility” of the chain will increase owing to the creation of a 
transparent information storage system that will allow participants to 
determine the status of any parameter of a shipped product at any point 
of its journey by any transport type. 


Transport data and process status information will come from the 
ERP system as well as from carriers through either direct connections or 
third-party portals. GPS technology will allow companies to verify 
precise locations; a variety of sensors will monitor the environment to 
shape storage conditions and provide remote protection against thefts. 
As far as the data comes from various sources, such as suppliers, carriers, 
warehouses, and distributors, its quality and interoperability is critical. 


One of the most important achievements and advantages of the 
proposed extended architectural model is the capability of creating new 
services, which can develop subsequently as independent DES inter-
acting with other external ones. By forming such “networks of digital 
ecosystems” DES themselves will act as drivers for the development of 
new services, and, probably, new promising technological solutions. The 
extended architecture model of information interaction between DES in 
supply chains is shown in Fig. 3. 


The extended architecture model embodies the principles of 
distributed computing and the creation of high-load big data systems 
based on the Lambda architecture. These principles underlie the devel-
opment of a framework for mobile network monitoring (Suleykin et al., 
2019). This is a scalable and resilient data processing and storage ar-
chitecture that addresses the need for a robust and fault-tolerant system 
with regards to both hardware failures and human errors. 


It is able to operate in a wide range of workloads and applications 
where low latency reads and updates are required. The system designed 
this way should be linearly scalable and must scale rather horizontally 
than vertically. 


The integration layer of the extended architecture model serves as a 
single entry point for all incoming information flows and for data ex-
change between different DES (agents). All data is converted into a

single format using common data transfer protocols. 
The messaging layer is, in turn, required to allow different sub-


scribers to access the same data or data consumers. This enables data 
usage for developing various control models either for real-time appli-
cations, or for subsequent analysis, visualization, and creating other 
models that do not require permanent online model changes. The 
models can be developed based on batch data uploading into the storage 
or Data Lake. 


Visualization and decision-making level allows to make on-line and 
off-line decisions on the basis of different data formats: analysis results, 
data visualization, or predictive e-learning models. Management and 
control of a real-life system is carried out on the basis of the obtained 
results and signal messages of the alert module in real time. 


Suppliers and consumers are also involved in the decision-making 
process and form collaborations to attain maximum benefits from joint 
activities. In that way, new services are formed, which subsequently 
serve as drivers for further development of new ones. The model be-
comes autonomous, self-learning and self-organizing. 


Example: digital warehouse management agent 


The operation of a DES control system may be discussed by exam-
ining its fragment: a Digital Agent (DA) of company’s warehouse, say, in 
automotive industry. Major automotive companies practice external 
procurement of components for assembly, metals, auxiliary products 
and materials, tools, and spare parts. DA carries out information inter-
action with other corporate information management systems, as well as 
support for decision-making on inventory control. 


DA is characterized by the presence of some intelligent add-on over 
WMS, which, along with the coordination of data exchange (within the 
warehouse, as well as with MES, ERP and other corporate systems), 
helps to optimize warehouse and other production processes in real 
time. DA contains a description of business processes and scenarios for 
interacting with corporate information systems which enable on-line 
information exchange. DA also stores the structured data on the oper-
ation of these business processes. 


On the basis of data streaming, the system: 


• predicts on-line the deviations of the actual delivery times of com-
ponents from the scheduled ones, 


• forecasts shortages (if, e.g., the delivery time increases due to un-
foreseen circumstances) and illiquidity,  


• determins the inventory size for scarce items, taking into account the 
forecast demand. 


Based on the algorithms for predicting demand dynamics and 
possible bottlenecks, delivery planning for the next period can be carried 
out by the ERP system. 


Also, by getting information from these models, a manufacturing 
execution system (MES) may carry out on-line the necessary changes in 
the current production planning and scheduling, as well as modeling the 
schemes of component parts transportation from suppliers directly to 
the workshop without warehousing. This eliminates time delays in order 
execution with inevitable losses. The scheme of the above mentioned 
and other on-line operations is generalized in the form of a dynamic 
mathematical model of the control and prediction system. After a pre-
liminary (at the learning phase) statistical analysis, identification 
models are developed and tuned on-line using associative search algo-
rithms (Bakhtadze and Lototsky, 2016). 


The model for delivery times prediction may look as follows: 


y⌢m (t) =
∑L


i=1
aiy⌢m (t − i) +


∑n


j=1


∑R


r=1
bjrxrm(t − j),


where: 
y⌢m (t) is the remaining (at the time step t) actual stock of time for the 


execution of the order for the supply of the m-th component (once the 
earlier orders for the supply of this item from the same source were 
completed). 


xrm(t), r = 1, …, R are the factors of possible deviation of the lead 
time from the contractual value. The values of the coefficients ai and bj 
are determined while the predictive model is updated.

If, for a certain time, the item was supplied from several sources, the 
model becomes more complicated: 


y⌢m (t) =
∑K


k=1


∑L


i=1
aiky⌢mk(t − i) +


∑K


k=1


∑n


j=1


∑R


r=1
bjrxrmk(t − j),


where K is the number of involved suppliers. 
The factors of possible deviation of the order execution time from the 


planned one should include the following variables whose values are 
received and processed on-line:   


• risks of transportation delay,  
• possible delays of other orders processing,  
• expert forecasts of production risks. 


Data processing includes data fusion with asynchronous update of 
various type data. 


The DT also contains updated models for various purposes: fore-
casting the deviations of deficit and illiquidity values in the warehouse 
from the planned indicators, forecasting sales and demand, forecasting 
the dynamics of components need and possible bottlenecks, etc. 


Digital processing and storage of the data for these identification 
models makes it possible to support decision-making on the manage-
ment of key business processes in cargo handling management based on 
the address storage system in an automatic digital warehouse. 


Conclusion 


The article offers an approach to DES control based on model pre-
dictive control (MPC) technology. The models developed by means of e- 
learning algorithms and inductive knowledge about DES dynamics were 
proposed as predictive identification models. The cases of nonlinear and 
nonstationary systems were investigated. 


An approach was proposed to evaluating the state of a complex of 
heterogeneous DES resources and predicting emergency situations in 
real time. The approach is based on binary coding of state values for 
different types of DES resources with subsequent application of the as-
sociation rule search algorithm which belongs to data mining 
techniques. 


The development of DES in the field of supply chains was investi-
gated. Key advantages of such DES for companies and enterprises were 
analyzed. The article offers a business model, as well as the model of 
general and enhanced architectural interaction of information flows 
between different classes of systems as well as within the DES itself. 


Further investigation of digital identification models for the situa-
tional DES management looks promising. This may include the modeling 
of poorly formalized factors such as the effect of ambient conditions. 
Future work also aims at the enhancement and specification of the 
development of DES elements and subsystems. 


Another research perspective is the implementation of the proposed 
SCM DES control system framework for certain companies: design of 
necessary digital agents, integration of incoming SCM data for model-
ling, development of predictive models (both real-time and batch) for 
control system and, finally, modeling the data exchange with external 
environment (external DES). The implementation of DES in SCM is 
planned on the basis of Open-Source Big Data technologies that have 
already proved their efficiency in data processing and machine learning 
models development and implementation. 


In the post-pandemic world, the need for external data exchange of 
SCM DES with other DES (not only SCM) holds much promise. We 
propose to use DES for SCM as a basic concept for communicating with 
external DES environment such as governmental, sales, marketing eco-
systems, etc. This will be a strong driver for the development of new DES 
with high effectiveness of regular data utilization.
