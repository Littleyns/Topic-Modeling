Abstract 


Under the concept of "Industry 4.0", production processes will be pushed to be increasingly interconnected, 
information based on a real time basis and, necessarily, much more efficient. In this context, capacity optimization 
goes beyond the traditional aim of capacity maximization, contributing also for organization’s profitability and value. 
Indeed, lean management and continuous improvement approaches suggest capacity optimization instead of 
maximization. The study of capacity optimization and costing models is an important research topic that deserves 
contributions from both the practical and theoretical perspectives. This paper presents and discusses a mathematical 
model for capacity management based on different costing models (ABC and TDABC). A generic model has been 
developed and it was used to analyze idle capacity and to design strategies towards the maximization of organization’s 
value. The trade-off capacity maximization vs operational efficiency is highlighted and it is shown that capacity 
optimization might hide operational inefficiency.

1. Introduction 


The cost of idle capacity is a fundamental information for companies and their management of extreme importance 
in modern production systems. In general, it is defined as unused capacity or production potential and can be measured 
in several ways: tons of production, available hours of manufacturing, etc. The management of the idle capacity

1. Introduction 


The first three industrial revolutions evolved through proper management of the mechanization, electricity and IT 
phenomenon. The recent trend of the Internet of Things (IoT) has heavily influenced the manufacturing environment 
and thus promoted the fourth industrial revolution – Industry 4.0. The forthcoming businesses will certainly establish 
global networks and incorporate their machinery, warehousing systems and production facilities as internet-enabled 
cyber physical systems. In the manufacturing context, these cyber physical systems comprise smart machines, storage 
systems and production facilities capable of exchanging information, triggering actions and controlling each other 
independently. In general, this brings significant improvements to the industrial processes involved in manufacturing, 
engineering, supply chain and life cycle management. In practice, products are uniquely identified, may be located at 
all times and it is possible to know their own history, current status and alternative routes for achieving their target 
state. It is deeply recognized and emphasized the huge potential of the Industry 4.0 among successful industrial 
companies, which will become true digital enterprises, with physical products at the core of its action, augmented by 
the digital interfaces and the development of innovative data-based services. For example, in Industry 4.0 dynamic 
business and engineering processes enable last minute changes to production and deliver the ability to respond with 
flexibility to the disruptions and failures on behalf of suppliers. End-to-end transparency is provided over the 
manufacturing process, facilitating optimized decision-making. Industry 4.0 paradigm will certainly also promote the 
development of new ways of creating value and innovative business models, in particular, it will provide startups and 
small businesses with opportunity to develop and provide downstream services [1]. It is undoubtedly that smart 
factories have already begin to appear, and introduce a completely new approach to production and supply chain 
management. But whenever there is a widespread change, new inherent challenges arise, particularly regarding 
information and communications security issues. The integration of new systems and their increased hypothetical 
potential third-party access mean that a whole new range of security issues arise in this context. Security is critical to 
the success of smart manufacturing systems. It is important to ensure the protection of the enterprise infrastructures as 
well as the data and information contained in their systems against misuse and unauthorized access.  


In this paper, it is highlighted some reflections regarding the challenges of Industry 4.0 emphasizing the security 
issues, in order to raise awareness required in Industry 4.0. This paper is structured as follows: in section 2, it is 
introduced the current challenges of manufacturing industry processes, in the advent of Industry 4.0; in section 3, it is 
presented an overview of the security challenges organizations should be aware, including an overview of the major 
security threats; conclusions and further developments are presented in section 4. 


2. Challenges in Industry 4.0 


The term Industry 4.0 is recent and is related with the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) 
evolvement, particularly the integration of information technology, into the production processes. Industry 4.0 refers 
to the fourth in a series of technological revolutions: the first Industrial Revolution brought through the invention of 
the steam engine and the increase use of water and steam power, resulting into the mechanization of the industry at 
the end of the 18th century; The second industry revolution labeled as the “Mass Production” was promoted by the 
introduction of electricity and the assembly line at the start of the 20th century; Finally, the third era of revolution 
came with the advent of computers and the beginning of automation, when robots and machines began to replace 
human workers on those assembly lines. This third revolution era was known as “Information Age”, evolving to 
“knowledge-based economy”. The recognition of knowledge as “human capital” together with IT technology brought 
important impacts in economic growth, and consequently promotes the emergence of the fourth Industrial Revolution 
through the use of cyber technologies [2, 3]. The value proposition of the industry concept 4.0 is closely associated 
with the end-to-end digitization of all physical assets and with the integration into digital ecosystems of all value chain 
partners [4]. 


These cyber-technologies are leading to the creation of a “smart” and highly versatile cyber-physical production 
environment. It involves various smart sensors, connected self-configuring robots, cloud computing, 3D printing, 
device to device (D2D) communications, big data analytics and communication channels sending and receiving 
massive amounts of data. The integration of cyber-technologies turns products and services as internet-enabled, which 
facilitates the integration of processes and systems across sectors and technologies and thus contributes to a better 


  T. Pereira et al. / Procedia Manufacturing 00 (2017) 000–000 3


communication and cooperation with each other in a new intelligent way, revolutionizing production, services 
provision, logistics and resource planning in a more effective way and cost efficient manner [5][6][7]. Additionally, 
it creates innovative services such as Internet-based diagnosis, maintenance, operations, mobility et cetera, which 
enhances the development of new business models, operating concepts and smart controls, mainly focusing on the 
user needs. The “Internet of Things” (IoT) has also affected the industrial sector and brought new benefits for 
customers, as it is evidenced by shortened production cycles, incorporation of customer needs in real time, 
maintenance is largely carried out automatically, orders are automatically filled in the right order, shipped and 
dispatched.  


In practice, the goal of the Industry 4.0 is the emergence of digital manufacturing or also named as “smart” factory, 
which means smart networking, mobility, flexibility of industrial operations and their interoperability, integration of 
customers and innovative business models [2]. 


2.1. Smart networking 


Internal logistics systems and operating supplies as well as automated systems and equipment are usually operated 
through the help of cyber technologies, such as wireless communication services, smart sensors and 5G 
telecommunication technologies [8]. These facilitate the accessibility to the resources used and a smart control, adding 
value to the business performance. Smart networking in smart factories requires “Plug&Work” synchronized 
networking, distributed processing capabilities, heterogeneous sensor interfaces and layered cyber-security. Software 
Defined Networks (SDN) is an essential element for the implementation of smart networking [9]. Furthermore, a 
cloud-assisted Industrial Wireless Network (IWN) can be suitable for supporting the adoption of the smart factory 
concept, as well as to support the implementation of the IoT paradigm and desirable services [10, 11]. 


2.2. Mobility 


Smartphones and tablets have already made changes in industrial automation. In fact, they provide a temporally 
and spatially independent access to processes and services of the automated systems, introducing efficient mechanisms 
in the diagnostics, maintenance and operation of these systems. Mobility allows, using cloud-based platforms, to use 
system-based applications, real-time end-to-end planning and horizontal collaboration. With these systems, companies 
can become more efficiently integrated with horizontal value chain partners, including suppliers and key customers, 
and also significantly improve efficiencies and reduce inventories. In addition, the use of Device-to-Device (D2D) 
communications, can be used to track-and-trace devices on products allowing a better inventory performance and 
reduced logistics cost. Normally, each company develops a cloud-based system for connecting machines and devices 
from a variety of companies, facilitating transactions, operations and logistics, and collecting and analyzing data [4, 
12]. 


2.3. Flexibility and interoperability 


In the development of automated systems, it is possible to select the best offer from a large number of suppliers’ 
components, modules and services. For example, the operations diagnosis can be carried out partly by the user, through 
access to the information retrieved on-demand, intelligently used and linked. The Big Data certainly provide important 
inputs, not only in the automation operation, but as well in the maintenance, diagnosis and development. Additionally, 
the integration of diverse organizational systems promotes their interoperability, which means that machine, devices, 
sensors and people are connected and can communicate with each other.  


Over time, the IoT dissemination will force companies to move away from proprietary to open standards-based 
industrial solutions that will facilitate the connectivity and interoperability between devices. The industrial devices 
are commonly based in proprietary designs that not use standard communication protocols. Therefore, these industrial 
settings tend to be extremely inflexible and consequently it will limit the full potential of IoT implementation [13].

2.4. Integration of customers 


Organizations are developing incommensurable efforts to facilitate the customization of their products according 
to specific individual needs of customers. Customers will be at the center of the changes to value chains, in the 
conception and definition of products and services. By integrating new methods of data collection and analysis, 
companies will be able to generate data on its product use and subsequently redefine products to meet the increasing 
needs of the end-customers [13].  


The Industry 4.0 paradigm is about attaining a perfect alignment between companies and costumers through e-
commerce, digital marketing and social media, as well as through monitoring closely the costumers’ experience. 
Companies that properly address efforts on these purposes will gain outstanding advantages in customer service, 
flexibility, efficiency and cost reduction. This business goal cannot be fully achieved without the integration of the 
supply chain, namely by connecting suppliers, manufacturing, logistics, warehousing, and costumers, conveniently 
driven through a cloud-based command center which continuously accesses the performance and the feedback of each 
supply chain member and of its stakeholders. The main goal of the digital supply chain is to deliver the right product 
into the customer's predefined spot as quickly as possible. Additionally following a responsively and reliably way, 
will certainly increase performance and efficiency, and increasingly reduce costs through automation [14]. 


2.5. Innovative business models 


The increase development and use of the word-wide-web have promoted the expansion of on-line transactions 
enabling a flexible distribution of organizational products and services. In fact, organizations are also conducting their 
businesses on-line through the use of e-commerce platforms, in order to offer their customer innovative services and 
also to reach other markets. The trend is to offer modular and configurable products, in order to adapt the product to 
the specific requirements. 


The main goal of all these technological challenges is to computerize as much as possible the manufacturing 
industry without the need for human involvement. The financial investments in technology are carried out to achieve 
a higher level of automation, in order to supply chains and production lines become more sophisticated, which means 
machines using self-optimization, self-configuration and even artificial intelligence to complete complex tasks 
allowing to deliver vastly superior cost efficiencies and better quality goods and services. The IoT and cyber-physical 
systems such as, for example, the increase volume of sensors promotes the collection of data, which can be used by 
manufacturers and producers to act upon quickly. In practice, the supply chains and production lines could be more 
readily controlled when there is data at every level of the manufacturing and delivery process; Computer control could 
produce much more reliable and consistent productivity and output, and the results could be increased revenues, 
market share and profits [15].  


However, the beginning of this innovative era brings new and critical risks, especially in the security domain. In 
fact, whenever there is a widespread change, new inherent challenges arise, particularly regarding information security 
issues. The integration of new systems and their increased access may greatly raise new data security breaches. In 
practice, organizations should be able to identify their critical assets, and by critical it is meant, the organizational 
resources needed to operate normally, and after that identify the adequate secure mechanisms to be implemented, in 
order to ensure the reliability and stability for successful communications, as well as ensuring the confidentiality, 
integrity and availability of their automated systems.  


3. The security challenges in manufacturing industry 


The technological evolution has conducted to significant changes to the way organizations daily operate creating 
unprecedented pressure towards efficiency and performance. Actually, organizations heavily relay on the performance 
of their information systems to develop their business activities, resulted from their conveniences together with the 
emergence of new technologies. The clouding-based systems, Internet of Things (IoT), Industry 4.0 and the so-called 
Bring Your Own device (BYOD), or as IT professionals also call it “bring your own demon”, and Choose Your Own 
Device (CYOD) trend, has brought new enterprise technological changes but with increased security risks. The trend 
of everything around us becoming smart is not going to stop and engineers who design new innovative systems should 


  T. Pereira et al. / Procedia Manufacturing 00 (2017) 000–000 5


have in mind their security implications. In fact, “Smart” is not just about creating more opportunities and building 
faster and more valuable communications, it is also about making responsible infrastructure for those gains, and 
building robustness into the framework. The interconnected organizational systems significantly increase the exposure 
to many security risks, with critical and financial impacts. Malicious hackers exploit software vulnerabilities in the 
system components to disrupt the whole production chain, potentially for long periods of time if attacks are physically 
destructive. Fig. 1 illustrates an example of some security risks, in a business process: Online ordering for customers.  


Fig. 1. Security risks examples in an organizational business process. Source: Reporting Information Risk ISF, 2010 [18].


Furthermore, subtle flaws can be introduced in the manufactured product which might compromise the image of 
the company or even attack the users of the manufactured or processed product. For example, a Trojan horse in a 
dashboard of every manufactured car can steal the personal information of their drivers. A more visible security 
incident detected was Stuxnet virus [16], which exploited vulnerabilities in the Supervisor Control and Data 
Acquisition (SCADA) systems [17]. Physical attacks and cyberattacks have evolved and are getting more 
sophisticated, in order to compromise critical assets, and cause a serious and global impacts. In this context, it is 
encourage fostering appropriate knowledge of security and awareness for security good practices, in order to build 
secure systems from the beginning rather than discover that what it was built was a pool of security flaws. 


It is noticed, that government’s bodies’ worldwide have been advocating to cybersecurity issues and have 
developed significant efforts and resources to strengthening a cyberdefense posture. The strategy is to increase 
collaboration between governments, private sector and academia.  


In this context, and in order to reinforce these actions, the European Parliament has recently (April of 2016) 
published and approved Directive 2016/679, requiring all European organizations to prove their capability to protect 
their organizational processing activities and the free flow of personal data between Member States [19]. This will 
force organizations to implement an information security plan, to enable them to recover from a security incident. 
However most of the organizations are facing serious difficulties. First, most of the organizations have a completely 
lack of knowledge of this EU Directive. Second, they do not know how to translate organizational procedures into 
security policies and, much less, how to implement and manage a set of mechanisms to enforce those policies. Third, 
and with special concerning, small and medium enterprises cannot afford to invest the required budget in their IT 
infrastructure protection and workforce and thus to be in compliance with this Directive.  


This EU Directive in conjunction with the new security challenges, which daily emerge, demand highly skilled 
workforce capable of responding to a dynamic and rapidly evolving threat scenario. In this context, academia and 
organizations should join efforts to offer information security, cybersecurity education, training and certification, with

2.4. Integration of customers

conception and definition of products and services. By integrating new methods of data collection and analysis,

The Industry 4.0 paradigm is about attaining a perfect alignment between companies and costumers through e-
commerce, digital marketing and social media, as well as through monitoring closely the costumers’ experience. 
Companies that properly address efforts on these purposes will gain outstanding advantages in customer service, 
flexibility, efficiency and cost reduction. This business goal cannot be fully achieved without the integration of the 
supply chain, namely by connecting suppliers, manufacturing, logistics, warehousing, and costumers, conveniently 
driven through a cloud-based command center which continuously accesses the performance and the feedback of each 
supply chain member and of its stakeholders. The main goal of the digital supply chain is to deliver the right product 
into the customer's predefined spot as quickly as possible. Additionally following a responsively and reliably way, 
will certainly increase performance and efficiency, and increasingly reduce costs through automation [14]. 


2.5. Innovative business models 


The increase development and use of the word-wide-web have promoted the expansion of on-line transactions 
enabling a flexible distribution of organizational products and services. In fact, organizations are also conducting their 
businesses on-line through the use of e-commerce platforms, in order to offer their customer innovative services and 
also to reach other markets. The trend is to offer modular and configurable products, in order to adapt the product to 
the specific requirements. 


The main goal of all these technological challenges is to computerize as much as possible the manufacturing 
industry without the need for human involvement. The financial investments in technology are carried out to achieve 
a higher level of automation, in order to supply chains and production lines become more sophisticated, which means 
machines using self-optimization, self-configuration and even artificial intelligence to complete complex tasks 
allowing to deliver vastly superior cost efficiencies and better quality goods and services. The IoT and cyber-physical 
systems such as, for example, the increase volume of sensors promotes the collection of data, which can be used by 
manufacturers and producers to act upon quickly. In practice, the supply chains and production lines could be more 
readily controlled when there is data at every level of the manufacturing and delivery process; Computer control could 
produce much more reliable and consistent productivity and output, and the results could be increased revenues, 
market share and profits [15].  


However, the beginning of this innovative era brings new and critical risks, especially in the security domain. In 
fact, whenever there is a widespread change, new inherent challenges arise, particularly regarding information security 
issues. The integration of new systems and their increased access may greatly raise new data security breaches. In 
practice, organizations should be able to identify their critical assets, and by critical it is meant, the organizational 
resources needed to operate normally, and after that identify the adequate secure mechanisms to be implemented, in 
order to ensure the reliability and stability for successful communications, as well as ensuring the confidentiality, 
integrity and availability of their automated systems.  


3. The security challenges in manufacturing industry 


The technological evolution has conducted to significant changes to the way organizations daily operate creating 
unprecedented pressure towards efficiency and performance. Actually, organizations heavily relay on the performance 
of their information systems to develop their business activities, resulted from their conveniences together with the 
emergence of new technologies. The clouding-based systems, Internet of Things (IoT), Industry 4.0 and the so-called 
Bring Your Own device (BYOD), or as IT professionals also call it “bring your own demon”, and Choose Your Own 
Device (CYOD) trend, has brought new enterprise technological changes but with increased security risks. The trend 
of everything around us becoming smart is not going to stop and engineers who design new innovative systems should 


  T. Pereira et al. / Procedia Manufacturing 00 (2017) 000–000 5


have in mind their security implications. In fact, “Smart” is not just about creating more opportunities and building 
faster and more valuable communications, it is also about making responsible infrastructure for those gains, and 
building robustness into the framework. The interconnected organizational systems significantly increase the exposure 
to many security risks, with critical and financial impacts. Malicious hackers exploit software vulnerabilities in the 
system components to disrupt the whole production chain, potentially for long periods of time if attacks are physically 
destructive. Fig. 1 illustrates an example of some security risks, in a business process: Online ordering for customers.  


Fig. 1. Security risks examples in an organizational business process. Source: Reporting Information Risk ISF, 2010 [18].


Furthermore, subtle flaws can be introduced in the manufactured product which might compromise the image of 
the company or even attack the users of the manufactured or processed product. For example, a Trojan horse in a 
dashboard of every manufactured car can steal the personal information of their drivers. A more visible security 
incident detected was Stuxnet virus [16], which exploited vulnerabilities in the Supervisor Control and Data 
Acquisition (SCADA) systems [17]. Physical attacks and cyberattacks have evolved and are getting more 
sophisticated, in order to compromise critical assets, and cause a serious and global impacts. In this context, it is 
encourage fostering appropriate knowledge of security and awareness for security good practices, in order to build 
secure systems from the beginning rather than discover that what it was built was a pool of security flaws. 


It is noticed, that government’s bodies’ worldwide have been advocating to cybersecurity issues and have 
developed significant efforts and resources to strengthening a cyberdefense posture. The strategy is to increase 
collaboration between governments, private sector and academia.  


In this context, and in order to reinforce these actions, the European Parliament has recently (April of 2016) 
published and approved Directive 2016/679, requiring all European organizations to prove their capability to protect 
their organizational processing activities and the free flow of personal data between Member States [19]. This will 
force organizations to implement an information security plan, to enable them to recover from a security incident. 
However most of the organizations are facing serious difficulties. First, most of the organizations have a completely 
lack of knowledge of this EU Directive. Second, they do not know how to translate organizational procedures into 
security policies and, much less, how to implement and manage a set of mechanisms to enforce those policies. Third, 
and with special concerning, small and medium enterprises cannot afford to invest the required budget in their IT 
infrastructure protection and workforce and thus to be in compliance with this Directive.  


This EU Directive in conjunction with the new security challenges, which daily emerge, demand highly skilled 
workforce capable of responding to a dynamic and rapidly evolving threat scenario. In this context, academia and 
organizations should join efforts to offer information security, cybersecurity education, training and certification, with 






1258 T. Pereira et al. / Procedia Manufacturing 13 (2017) 1253–1260
6 T. Pereira et al. / Procedia Manufacturing 00 (2017) 000–000


well-defined skilled objectives and competences aligned with organizational and social current security needs, at all 
necessary levels to make it effective to every segment of the population - which is far from being a simple task. 


3.1. The major security threats facing Industry 4.0 


Industry 4.0 and the technology involved have security vulnerabilities as other organizational systems. They have 
to manage the same external and insider threats as all businesses of all sizes have to handle in the current sophisticated 
cyber security sphere. The smart factory by its nature, is interconnected to many other systems, consequently any 
extended system is complex and with complexity comes significant increases of unexpected security vulnerabilities. 
Next, are presented some security threats that Industry 4.0 players need to focus on, and try to mitigate its impact [20] 
[21].  


Enterprise Cyber-Espionage, Confidential Information and Intellectual Property  
Industry 4.0 is more vulnerable to cyber-espionage because of the smart and connected business processes. 


Currently it has been seen the development of well organized groups of cyber-criminal with excellent skills used to 
targeting specific industries, towards hacking sensitive information and intellectual property. One example of such a 
group is the Black Vine group [22], which focuses on industries such as aerospace, energy and healthcare. Examples 
of actions performed by these types of groups are for instance the recent allegations of the US steel industry, which 
has accused the Chinese government of stealing intellectual property through a sustained hacking attack. The problem 
associated to this phenomenon is not confined to its impact on sales but also include damage to organizational image, 
loss of know-how and reduced level of competitiveness by the affected organizations. The targeted theft of corporate 
and product know-how starts to becoming increasingly common, especially in the form of software and functionalities 
that currently continue to be very easy to copy. In the scope of Industry 4.0 these threats assume even greater 
importance resulted from the cooperation between different partners in the network. Therefore, it is important to find 
solutions that guarantee trust and transparency within the platform, as well as the protection of the critical know-how 
business [1]. A security approach to be considered includes data loss prevention solutions in conjunction with 
encryption algorithms to protect high value data assets. 


Denial-of-Service 
Denial-of-Service (DoS), also known as a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), is the process of making a system 


or application unavailable. For example, a DoS attack might be accomplished by bombarding a server with huge 
number of requests to consume all available system resources, by passing the server malformed input data that can 
crash a process, by infiltrating a virus, or by destroying or disabling a sensor in a system, not allowing it to operate 
normally [23]. Industry 4.0 relies on a great number of interconnected systems and processes, the DoS attacks are a 
very important threat in such environments. Additionally as cloud computing gains popularity, and it is has been 
widely used in the smart factory concept, it is likely that more criminals find new ways to exploit system vulnerabilities 
like applying Denial-of-Service. The damage caused by a Denial-of-Service cyberattack can wind up being very costly 
for a company. Such an attack causes material damage (servers and sensors need to be replaced or put back to normally 
work; network needs to be reprogramed; systems need to be redesigned) but also operational and financial to cause 
damage (service interruption, complex protocols for resuming operations, new training for machine operators). In this 
context, for the industrial sector, DoS attacks are often unforeseeable and very difficult to control. 


Supply Chain and the Extended Systems 
One of the Industry 4.0 features is the ability to connect across organizational environments, which has the potential 


to make the supply chain more efficient. However, the supply chain systems have inherent security vulnerabilities, 
which are exploited by attackers. One of the security vulnerabilities starts with the supplier, which is vulnerable to 
phishing attacks and the stolen of privileged credentials, resulting in mass data exposure. The major vulnerability is 
in the top of the supply chain, reaching the rest of the organizational processes through its dependent actors [21]. 
Security awareness, control access through authentication mechanisms, cryptographic processes, and behavioral 
analysis are the security mechanisms that can help to prevent a supply chain hacking. 


Smart Security and the Smart Factory 
The same way the industrial revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries evidenced massive industrial and societal 


changes, Industry 4.0 will also bring diverse changes in the way industries work and the way they collaborate and 
innovate. Highly connected industries can offer improvements across all of manufacturing industries, utilities and 


  T. Pereira et al. / Procedia Manufacturing 00 (2017) 000–000 7


even healthcare manufacturers [20]. Big data generated through the IoT can give useful information regarding how 
things work and what can be improved. However new “things” usually bring unexpected security vulnerabilities and 
threats to exploit and the attackers are actively working to ensure they get their share of Industry 4.0. Using smart 
security which means by implementing preventive security policies, instead of responsive procedures, will be able to 
mitigate the impact of smart security’ vulnerabilities exploitation. Additionally, it is also crucial to raise awareness 
among all the people involved in production, from skilled machine operators to secure software developers and 
planning engineers working in the field of plant engineering. When security solutions are implemented within an 
organization, it is not enough to simply install technical products. Employees need to be conveniently trained with 
regard to the security requirements and standards. The implementation of awareness-raising campaigns requiring the 
involvement of all manufacturing environment could help to overcome the current shortcomings in this area [21]. 
Additionally, the introduction of compulsory classes and research groups on this topic at higher education institutions 
would help to prepare the workforce for the future. 


Moving towards Industry 4.0 is a huge task and has impacts in many areas in today’s manufacturing industry, 
particularly in security. Most of manufacturing companies are not fully aware of the security risks that came with the 
adoption of Industry 4.0 paradigm. Normally, they only handle security issues, when a serious incident occurs. So, it 
is essential, and urgent, that organizations embrace the development of a strategy to deploy and run security 
compliance processes that Industry 4.0 requires, especially towards reducing the organizational level of exposition as 
well as to proper manage the mitigation procedure of its impacts. 


4. Conclusions and further developments 


In the organizational context, security usually means financial investments with no return of investment (ROI), 
which explains the fact that security incidents are usually handled once the development process is over and when a 
critical security incident occurs, with serious and dramatic impacts to the organization. However, this procedure is 
costly and also often fails to deliver a permanent solution to the relevant problem. Moreover, it might condition the 
source of differentiation among competitors and ruin the competitive advantages and the organizational confidence in 
their business activities. 


Moving towards Industry 4.0 brings diverse technological challenges, with high impacts in many areas in today’s 
manufacturing industry especially in the security domain. To meet the technological challenges raised by the Industry 
4.0, it is essential to develop a strategy to all the actors involved in the entire value chain, to reach a consensus on 
security issues and the relevant architecture before implementation begins. Security issues are now starting to be 
discussed. The EU directive 2016/679 comes to reinforce the concern regarding security and the implementation of 
adequate organizational secure actions to ensure the protection of the processing activities. The discussion around the 
importance of protecting IT of the various types of industrial equipment, it will certainly move Industry 4.0 forward 
and thus turn this new stage of industrial development eventually safer and securer for everyone.  


The specialists working groups indications will be critical towards enlighten the different possibilities that 
organizations will be able to implement or adopt into the near future. Notwithstanding, it will be extremely important 
to compile and to benchmark the solutions with better results attained and that might benefit the level of security of 
all stakeholders within the different business sectors.  


Therefore, it is intended to develop some case-studies about security policies and strategies developed in the 
organizations within the Industry 4.0 paradigm. The development of these case studies will be important to determine 
the level of existent awareness within organizations, as well as to explain the difficulties and pointing out the overall 
benefits of its implementation.
