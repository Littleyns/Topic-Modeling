Industry 4.0, which features the Internet of things (IoT), cloud computing, big-data, digitalization, and cyber-
physical systems, is transforming the way businesses are being run. It is making the business processes more
autonomous, automated and intelligent, and is transmuting the organizational structures of businesses by di-
gitalizing their end-to-end business processes. In this context, balancing innovation and ex-
ploitation—organization's ambidexterity—while stepping into the fourth industrial revolution can be critical for
organizational capability. This study examines the role of intellectual capital (IC)—human capital, structural
capital and relational capital—in balancing the innovation and exploitation activities. It also examines the role of
technology's absorptive capacity in the relationship between IC and organizational ambidexterity (OA). Data
were collected from 217 small and medium enterprises from the manufacturing sector of Pakistan using a closed-
ended Likert scale-based questionnaire. The study employs partial least square-Structural Equation Modeling
(PLS-SEM) for data analysis. Findings indicate a profound influence of all dimensions of IC, both overall and by
dimensions on organizations’ ambidexterity. Findings also exhibit a significant partial mediating role of tech-
nology absorptive capacity (TAC) in the association of IC and ambidexterity. The findings of the study emphasize
the creation of specific policies aimed to develop IC of a firm, which in turn can enable a firm to maintain a
balance between innovation and market exploitation activities. The study integrates the TAC with the IC-OA
relationship, which is the novelty of the study.


1. Introduction


The world is on the verge of a fourth industrial revolution (Industry
4.0), which is ready to transmute the way businesses exploit the mar-
kets, innovate and adopt technologies. The pace and momentum of this
revolution is unmatched, turbulent and exponential. Both practitioners
and researchers envision that Industry 4.0 can enable firms to gain ef-
ficiency and faster innovation. It is worth mentioning that this re-
volution is transforming the global economic structure and is in-
eluctable for any single country or organization (EEF-
The Manufacturers’ Organization, 2016). In such situation, businesses
are required to upgrade their technological and innovative capabilities
according to the Industry 4.0 needs for competing in the dynamic en-
vironment (Horváth, and Szabó, 2019; Frank et al., 2019). It is also
essentially revolutionizing the way organizations interact with their
customers, employees and suppliers. It is worth mentioning that In-
dustry 4.0 requires businesses to transform themselves by replacing the


old technologies, processes, and interactions with new ones. Further, in
the presence of staggering effects of COVID-19, the need to transform
businesses according to the paradigm of Industry 4.0 is ever-increasing
as the firms not only have to maintain a balance between their in-
novation and market exploitation activities but also need to enhance
their technological absorption capacity (TAC) to cope with the chal-
lenges posed by the this pandemic. There is mounting pressure on al-
most every industry across the globe (Vlačić et al., 2019; Kafouros et al.,
2020). Researchers claim that the impacts of the fourth industrial re-
volution are not only limited to large businesses but can also have a
profound influence on the small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
Hence, present day businesses, irrespective of their size and nature, are
entering a turbulent, challenging and dynamic business environment
(Ashton and Morton, 2005; Hitt et al., 1998). In this situation, the
survival and growth of a business greatly depends upon the way it
balances innovation and market exploitation—organizational ambi-
dexterity (OA)—and the extent to which it can absorb the technology-

related knowledge—technology absorptive capacity (TAC)—from the ex-
ternal environment. TAC provides firms with the capability to adapt
and evolve in the era of Industry 4.0. It allows firms to sustain a
competitive advantage by means of organizational innovation in the
context of a dynamic industry. TAC can also foster the capacity to ab-
sorb new technological knowledge—knowledge that is valuable be-
cause it leads to further organizational innovation. Researchers
(Ahmed et al., 2019;Mubarik, 2015) claim that the fourth industrial
revolution is profoundly changing the basis of competitive advantage
from tangible resources to intangible resources (Grant, 1996; Hitt et al.,
1998; Wong and Aspinwall, 2005; Secundo et al., al.,2020). In such
case, a firm's intellectual capital (IC) can play a fundamental role in
attaining OA, technology absorption and competitive advantage. The
importance of IC can be traced back to the resource-based researchers
mentioned earlier (e.g. Penrose, 1959; Becker, 1962; Wernerfelt, 1984)
who pointed out that a business's external environment and its level of
intangible resources determine its level of success. The resource-based
view (Wernerfelt 1984) claimed that competitive advantage of cor-
poration are rooted through organizations that have VRIN resources
(valuable, rare, inimitable and non-substitutable) (Kor and
Mahoney, 2004). VRIN can be acquired through human capital (HC),
relationships and processes collectively termed as IC ( Lev and Zambon
2003; Chu et al., 2006; Mubarik et al., 2019). By developing IC, a firm
can attain OA—a fit between its firm's innovation and exploitation activities
(Barney, 2001; ; Russo and Fouts, 1997). In an IC-ambidexterity dyad, a
firm's capacity to absorb outside technology related knowledge can play
an instrumental role (Mubarik 2015; Antonelli and Colombelli, 2011).
A number of studies (e.g. Ashton and Morton 2005; Barathi 2007;
Arenas, and Lavanderos, 2008; Hsu and Fang 2009; Asiaei, and Jusoh,
2015) examine the role of OA in the association between IC and firm
performance. However the scholastics work examining the role of TAC
in IC- OA is missing (Mubarik et al., 2019 Carte, 2005; Mouritsen, 1998,
2005; Seleim and Khalil, 2011; Alvarez and Barney, 2001; Nonaka and
Konno, 1998). Against this backdrop, examining how TAC intervenes in
the interplay of ICeOA is essential for devising strategies for IC led
ambidexterity. This study undertakes this task, and in doing so, it
contributes to the literature in three ways. First, it integrates the dis-
persed variables of IC, ambidexterity and absorptive capacity in the
framework, and provides empirical evidence on this triad. Second, it
provides application of IC-ambidexterity models in the context of SMEs
as the majority of the studies conducted on this conception focused on
the larger firms. Third, for the first time, the study introduces and ex-
amines the role of top management team in IC, ambidexterity and ab-
sorptive capacity triad.


The paper has been divided into five sections. The following section
briefly discusses the theoretical and empirical literature on the asso-
ciation of IC, OA and absorptive capacity interplay. Section 3 entails the
methodology employed for analysis whereas Section 4 discusses the
findings of the study. Section 5, the last section, concludes the study.


2. Review of literature


Organizations in the modern era are existing in a complex en-
vironment of ever-increasing dynamism and uncertainty. For the suc-
cess of an organization, it is vital for it to develop and acquire tacit
resources and knowledge (Hitt et al., 2001; Hitt et al., 1998), leading to
a shift from physical resources to intangible (imitable) resources, and
for gaining both ambidexterity and competitiveness (Ashton and
Morton, 2005; Wong and Aspinwall, 2005). Thus, management of
knowledge-based resources has become a key driver for better perfor-
mance and sustainable competitive advantage (Grant, 1996;
Mubarik et al., 2019; Sharkie, 2003; Teece, 2012). The literature on IC
contains attention-grabbing opinions about the technique in which or-
ganizations adjust exploration and exploitation activities. In the same
vein, HC, structural capital (SC) and relational capital (RC) represent
different knowledge stocks at different organizational levels


(Mubarik et al., 2019; Mubarik, 2015). These IC dimensions will in-
teract across different organizational levels, playing distinct roles when
creating ambidextrous capabilities (Fernández-Pérez et al., 2017;
Kang and Snell, 2009) and leading to superior organizational perfor-
mance (Andrews, 2010; Liu and Chen, 2009). Before discussing how the
IC interacts with OA and the role TMT plays in IC-ambidexterity dyad,
it is essential to review the various definitions of IC and how it is
measures. To this effect, the following section briefly reviews the de-
finition of IC and its way of operationalization.


2.1. Intellectual capital


The fourth Industrial Revolution creates new relationships between
humans and machines, along with changes in the work characteristics,
organizational structure and relationships. This has brought IC into the
heart of fourth industrial revolution and is the reason that researchers
claim that stepping into the fourth industrial revolution requires having
strong IC. The concept of IC primarily incorporates activities of em-
ployees, directors, intelligent human beings and stakeholders of the
company that create value. John Kenneth Galbraith (Itami, and Roehl.,
1991) first coined the term “intellectual capital” or IC in 1969. Ac-
cording to Edvinsson (1997) and Jørgensen and Boje (2010), the term
includes a degree of relative 'intellectual action'. Researchers mention
IC as the knowledge and relationships that can be transformed into
organizational performance. However the framing of IC as a subject of
research is a fairly new trend. It started from after the seminal article of
Stewart (1997) published in Fortune magazine where he discussed IC as
being the knowledge, ability, and strength of employees, which could
strengthen the competitiveness of an organization. He also mentioned
that the distinction between the market value and the book value of an
organization is IC. Various researchers (e.g. Barathi Kamath, 2007;
Bontis and Fitz-Enz, 2002; Bontis and Nikitopoulos, 2001; Kang and
Snell, 2009) from distinctive backgrounds explain the concept of IC
differently; however three components of IC can be found in almost
every definition: HC, RC and SC. The following lines briefly explain
each of these components.


Human Capital (HC): Defined as the knowledge, skills, and cap-
abilities of an individual the notion of HC can be traced back to the
early 1950s (Mubarik et al., 2018). However, the inception of HC
theory (Becker, 1962a) and theory of firm (Penrose, 1959) exposed the
importance of HC both at firm and country levels. These researchers
defined HC as the knowledge, skills, and abilities of a person that can be
instrumental in improving his job-related performance. Becker (1964)
explained that improving HC through education and training can in
turn improve an organization's performance. He also considered health
as an essential component of HC. Scholars in the early 1990s, (e.g.
Grant, 1996; Russo and Fouts, 1997; Edvinsson, 1997; Mouritsen, 1998;
Hitt et al., 1998) included qualities like attitude, creative thinking, and
problem solving as being part of HC, and they developed several con-
structs to measure it at the firm level. Likewise, HC of an organization is
also defined as the combined competencies of employees to resolve
problems of customers, suppliers, and the organization. The organiza-
tion-wide HC is the knowledge and institutional memory about prior-
itizing the importance of the organizational issues. This resource com-
prises the individual skills, collective experience, general know-how
and management expertise of all of the employees (Edvinsson, 1997).
Gupta and Roos (2001) determine that HC includes skills and knowl-
edge, so intellectual ability in employees work for quickly adopt
change, innovation and effective solution to the problem etc. Various
studies (Arshad et al., 2015; Hershberg, 1996; Mubarik et al., 2018)
considered HC as being the repository of knowledge, abilities and skills
exemplified in labor for the production and economic value. Thus, HC
can be defined as the knowledge and skills achieved by the worker
through experience and education (Sullivan and Sullivan, 2000). Diaz-
Fernandez et al. (2017) supported this definition and pointed out that
HC is comprised of personal attributes such as skills, knowledge, and

expertise. It is HC that plays a substantial part in organizational per-
formance as well as in the economic development of any country.
Drawing from the HC theory and resource-based theory, we define HC
as the knowledge, skills and abilities of the employees that are instru-
mental in increasing organizational performance (Figs. 1 and 2).


Structural capital (SC): From the perspective of the organization, SC
incorporates all non-human knowledge resources. SC represents an
organization's processes and structures through which it performs its
business transactions. These structures range from tangible to in-
tangible stuff that the organization offers, for instance, copyrights,
patents, software systems, databases, processes and trademarks, ac-
countability, organizational culture, trust among employees and effi-
ciency ( Zameer et al., 2020). Structural or organizational capital ac-
cordingly comprises of internal value drivers of an organization,
namely, routines, processes, customer files, database, manuals, and the
literature and structure of an organization (Reza et al., 2020)().
Asiaei and Jusoh (2015) state that organizational capital comprises of
internal capital, which encompasses management philosophy, in-
tellectual property, management processes, financial relations, in-
formation and networking systems, and corporate culture.


Relational capital (RC): RC is characterized by the organization's
reputation and the loyalty of customers. All of these resources are
connected to the organization's external relations with its suppliers,


stakeholders, and customers. In this regard, relational or social capital
is considered as the bond that is formed with organizational relation-
ships with stakeholders, and that impacts the lives of the organization.
Researchers (e.g., Eisenhardt and Sull, 2001;Kang et al., 2007;
Mom et al., 2015; Mubarik et al., 2016) explain relational or social
capital as being a blend of different relationships such as market re-
lationships, power relationships and cooperation. RC encompasses
trust, stronger understanding, collaboration and the relationship among
the strategic partners in this regard, and it characterizes interactions,
connection stocks, closeness, linkages, loyalty, and goodwill between
an organization and downstream clients, upstream suppliers, external
stakeholders, and strategic partners (Lazzarotti et al., 2017; Mubarik
et al., 2019; Naghavi and Mubarak, 2019). It is also called external
capital that comprises customers, brands, and the reputation of the
company business collaboration; and channels of distribution, licensing
agreements and customer satisfaction.


2.2. Organizational ambidexterity


Although OA was coined back in 1976 by Duncan, 1976 ) , the
concept gained heightened attention after the popularity of the fourth
industrial revolution. Industry 4.0 requires a balanced yet dynamic
approach to simultaneously drive the innovation and exploitation

3






activities, which cannot be attained without having OA. This notion of
an ambidextrous organization was substantiated by March, 1991),
suggesting exploitation (market capitalization) and exploration (in-
novation) as the two learning activities carried out by organizations.
Exploration entails innovation, experimentation, search, and discovery
whereas exploitation, in contrast, is linked with efficiency, selection,
refinement and implementation activities. Exploration and exploitation,
therefore, essentially require different strategies, organization struc-
tures and contexts. Various scholars agree that an organization faces
trade-off between properly exploiting existing competencies and ex-
ploring new opportunities by aligning their functions (García-
Morales et al., 2007;Alänge and Steiber, 2018; Baškarada et al., 2016;
Junni et al., 2013; Mubarik et al., 2019).


The most prevalent ambidextrous organizations are categorized as
contextual ambidexterity, innovative ambidexterity, structural ambi-
dexterity, and sequential ambidexterity.


Contextual Ambidexterity: This denotes the behavioural and inter-
active capacity to simultaneously determine adaptability and alignment
(Gibson and Birkinshaw, 2004). Meanwhile, the alignment includes the
consistency among the activities of organization units, while adapt-
ability is related to the ability for quickly configuring the activities in
connection with variations in the task environment. In contrast, other
concepts of OA state that contextual ambidexterity is based on the in-
stantaneous pursuit of paradoxical agendas within the single unit of an
organization. Innovative ambidexterity can be considered as an ambi-
dextrous result variable that captures the exploitation and exploration
performance of an organization (Simsek et al., 2009). Innovative am-
bidexterity indicates the firm's ability to instantaneously follow both
discontinuous [exploratory] and incremental [exploitative] innovation.


Structural ambidexterity: Is associated with essential trade-off in-
novative ambidexterity such as exploitative vs. exploratory innovation,
it is not determined with one organization unit. Structural ambi-
dexterity grounds on spatial separation of organizational units which
are furnished with paradoxical activities. (Jansen et al., 2012;
Volberda and Lewin, 2003), in this regard, referred to enabling me-
chanism of structural differentiation as segmenting organization system
into subunits, each tends to establish specific attributes in line with
requirements of the external environment and acknowledge this is a
possible avenue to organizations ambidexterity.


Sequential ambidexterity: In contrast to structural ambidexterity, se-
quential ambidexterity involves a vibrant perception on an either ex-
ploratory or exploitative decision and is gained through the mechanism
of temporal separation. Thus, sequential ambidexterity rises from dy-
namic, temporal sequencing of exploration and exploitation. This se-
quential ambidexterity perception is supported by Good and
Michel, 2013; Güttel and Konlechner, 2009; Junni et al., 2013). The
sequential ambidexterity is time paced sequence of exploitation and
exploration and stated that this is consistent with dynamic capability
view.


2.3. Association between IC and organizational ambidexterity


Researchers (Asiaei et al., 2018; Bontis and Nikitopoulos, 2001;
Khalique et al., 2015; Mubarik et al., 2019) mention IC as being the key
capability needed to acquire OA—a fit between exploitation and ex-
ploration. Mubarik et al. (2019) argue that organizational-level ambi-
dexterity can only be adopted by improving the ICs (firms processes,
HC, and relationships). They further explain that transforming the IC on
the lines of ambidexterity may enable firms to effectively maintain a
balance between exploration and exploitation activities. Likewise,
Bontis (1998) also mentions the need for the IC in maximizing and
balancing both exploitation and exploration activities of a firm. When
the organizations explore and exploit simultaneously, it is called the
organization ambidextrous learning. Because the organization together
use exploration, that is, identifying and learning new knowledge along
with their current knowledge to make of an organization and


exploitation, they make great use of its present organization resources
when giving an explanation. Hence, organizations have to bring about
the right mix of both exploration and exploitation. It implies that all
three components of IC play a fundamental role in the adaptation of
ambidexterity.


First HC—operationalized as education, skills and capabilities of
employees—plays a significant role in promoting both innovation and
productivity. It promotes ambitexterous capacity as employees possess
the creativity and competence that is essential to refine existing
knowledge and develop new knowledge (Kang and Snell, 2009; ). It is
precisely through such HC that ambidexterity is able to access and utilize
knowledge from multiple domains, discover novel solutions to existing pro-
blems, and challenge assumptions behind prevailing knowledge and prac-
tices. Effectively managed HC contributes to the incremental and radical
innovations (Mubarik et al., 2016; Raisch et al., 2009).
Asiaei et al. (2018) argue that experience, education, skills and training
are important dimensions of HC and they contribute to the ambidex-
trous behaviours. The higher levels of experience and knowledge enable
employees to resolve problems in a quick and effective matter. Like-
wise, these HC constructs also enables employees to work smartly and
effectively, thus increasing their ambidextrous characteristics
(Mubarik et al., 2019). Considering these arguments, the author pro-
poses that:


H1: Human capital (HC) has a positive influence on organizational
ambidexterity (OA).


Likewise, the RC, the second most important dimension of IC, in-
fluences the firm's ability to manage exploitation and exploration si-
multaneously. According to researchers (Mubarik et al., 2019, 2016),
improving relationship with suppliers and customers helps the organi-
zation not only in market exploitation but also in developing the new
market trends. Consequently, relational systems will facilitate interac-
tions between humans and processes to help them work together,
creating ambidexterity. Further, proper social perspective will help the
firm to overcome the tensions between exploitative and exploratory
activities (Lavie et al., 2010; Stettner and Lavie, 2014).


Relational/social capital also establishes itself in the associated ties
that ambidexterity can develop with external parties (e.g., alliance
partners, suppliers, customers and consumers). Connecting such ties
enables ambidexterity to both improve and renew their knowledge base
by having superior potential control and access to over a various range
of perspectives, specialized knowledge and skills (Mom et al., 2015;
Tiwana, 2008). Accordingly, we theorize that a relational/social capital
will promote the pursuit of ambidextrous learning activities by devel-
oping a perspective that supports access to and combination of diverse
skills and knowledge both within and across the confines of ambi-
dexterity. Along these lines, the author proposes that:


H2: Relational capital (RC) has a positive influence on organiza-
tional ambidexterity (OA).


There is no ambidextrous organizations is based on individual
learning. No organization can grow unless the individuals of that or-
ganization are well-skilled, but this is an inadequate condition for
ambidextrous organizations. Structural/organizational capital is the
knowledge that resides in organization system, patents, databases,
processes, and structures (Youndt et al., 2004). Hence, rather than
different firm's possessing, structural/organizational capital to develop
exploration and exploitation as two disconnected blocks, a versatile and
flexible structural/organizational capital is considered to attain OA.
Crossan et al. (1999) suggests that structural/organizational capital is
understood as the set of rules, structures, routines and standardized
processes followed by the organization to help build an organizational
culture with a similar frame of reference for all employees. It is ex-
ploitation in nature, and employees in the organization intend to solve
their problems based on the decisions that were previously proved
useful ( Chang et al., al.,2020). On the other hand, for Eisenhardt and

4






Sull (2001), the notion of structural/organizational capital is less con-
nected to rules, procedures and common style of work (Daft and
Weick, 1984) and provides new opportunities and autonomy for in-
dividual and group work in order to explore and experiment with the
new styles of work environment and the way in which they unify the
work. Drawing on the aforementioned discussion, the last proposition
is:


H3: Structural capital (SC) has a positive influence on organizational
ambidexterity (OA).


2.4. Technology absorptive capacity, IC and organizational ambidexterity


TAC is considered as being an essential organizational capability in
order to embrace the fourth industrial revolution. It appears to have a
profound influence on the activities related to technology and innova-
tion in organizations. It is closely linked with OA and is considered to be
the prime enabler of OA (Barney, 1991; Prahalad and Hamel, 2007).
Researchers (e.g. Lund Vinding, 2006; Zahra and George, 2002) argue
that organizations need to improve their capacity to absorb outside
technological knowledge—TAC—for improving their ambidexterity
(Lund Vinding, 2006; Zahra and George, 2002). Vinding (2006) defines
absorptive capacity as “the firm's ability to identify, assimilate and exploit
knowledge from the environment”. Drawing from the premise of HC
theory, resource-based view and IC theory, when IC can directly con-
tribute to a firm's ambidexterity, it has the potential to improve the firm
absorptive capacity (Mubarik, 2015). Absorptive capacity has two
major types: First, potential absorptive capacity, which represents ac-
quisition and assimilation of knowledge outside the firm. Second, rea-
lized absorptive capacity, which includes assimilation and transforma-
tion of knowledge outside the firm (Lund Vinding, 2006). García-
Morales et al., 2007, p.531) defines TAC as the process that “involves
acquisition (through which the firms obtains so called technological
stock), assimilation and transformation (the capacity to develop and
refine routines to facilitate combining existing technological knowledge
with that acquired, and to assimilate this knowledge and to exploit
technological knowledge)”. TAC helps a firm to upgrade, expand and
utilize existing capabilities and technologies to innovate, incorporating
the technological knowledge acquired and transforming the firm's op-
erations to increase the productivity of the goods and capital employed.
Firms can reinforce their technological competences by importing


external technologies and technological knowledge, and then diffusing,
assimilating, communicating and absorbing these into their organiza-
tions. Identifying, transforming, acquiring and exploiting technological
knowhow can only be done based on the knowledge and learning
processes that have already been mastered by the firm. As mentioned
by Bontis (2019) IC is an essential mainstay of TAC. Ahmed et al.
(2019) further argue that IC can play an instrumental role in improving
the TAC of a firm. They claim that all three dimensions of IC can help a
firm to interact with external environment and to identify, acquire and
assimilate the external knowledge related to the technology. A firm
with a strong TAC can have better capabilities to attain OA, whereas
deficient TAC acts an obstacles for the transfer of better practices,
technological knowledge, and OA. In short, enabling TAC can be in-
strumental in attaining OA.

3. Methodology


3.1. Population & sampling


For the study, the data was collected from the manufacturing sector
SMEs (Small Medium Enterprises) of Pakistan. According to the defi-
nition provided by the SMEDA (2018), organizations with the staff
between 10 and 100 are small, and between 101 and 250 are cate-
gorized as medium organizations. We approached 450 SMEs with the
help of Small and Medium Enterprises Development Authority
(SMEDA) of Pakistan. A total of 221 SMEs responded to our ques-
tionnaire by providing the required data. After screening 04 cases were
removed from the data because of unengaged responses and missing
values. Hence 217 cases were processed for analysis. Table 1 shows the
industry-wide distribution of the final sample used in the study.


3.2. Measurement


To collect the primary data from a large number of respondents, the
questionnaire proves to be a reliable tool. We developed a close-ended
questionnaire to collect the data. Table 2 exhibits the detail of the
constructs with sources. The questionnaire employed for the study had
two portions; first part containing the demographic information of the
respondent organization and the second part containing the items re-
lated to our conceptual framework. All the constructs were measured

on five points Likert scale where 1 (Strongly Disagree) 2 (Disagree) 3
(Neutral) 4 (Agree) 5 (Strongly Agree). The description of the in-
dividual constructs is given below.


Human capital (HC) is defined as the knowledge skills and abilities
exploit by individual employees. This resource comprises education,
experience, training, and skills.


Relational capital (RC) is defined as the knowledge embedded with
networks of interrelationships and their interactions among individuals.
This resource includes strategic alliances, customer and supplier rela-
tions, and customer knowledge.


Structural capital (SC) is the institutional Knowledge utilized
through patents, databases, structures, processes, and systems. This
resource encompasses the System and program, research and develop-
ment, intellectual property rights (IPRs).


Organizational Ambidexterity (OA) has been operationalized as ex-
ploration and exploitation are two matchless learning activities that
organizations split their resources and attention. This resource en-
compasses Exploration mentions to variation, experimentation, search,
and discovery; In contrast, exploitation is linked with efficiency, se-
lection, refinement and implementation activities. Exploration and ex-
ploitation, therefore, require radically different strategies, organization
structures and contexts.


Technology Absorptive Capacity (AC), is defined as “the firm's ability
to identify, assimilate and exploit the technology related knowledge
from the external environment”. This resource encompasses the
Supplier development department, Face-to-face meetings with supplier,
Intranet with knowledge management system and Cross-functional
meetings.


3.3. Analytical method: PLS-SEM


The study will apply PLS-structural equation modeling for testing
the framework. PLS-SEM has been preferred because of its ability to
model multiple relationships simultaneously. Similarly, the use of this
technique was opted due to its ability to control the endogeneity pro-
blem. PLS is also a preferred technique to model relationships when one
variable is dependent and independent at the same time. This technique
well caters the problem of non-normality of data and is considered
highly robust against non-normal data.


4. Results and discussions


4.1. Demography of the respondents


Table 3 shows the brief demography of the respondents’ organiza-
tions. The unit of analysis of the study is organization. A total of 450
organizations were approached for data collection whereas 217 orga-
nizations responded positively. It shows an average response rate of


48%. Among respondent firms 33% belong to textile, 28% leather, 16%
sports, 14% food and 9% from leather. The majority of the firms’ life
spans from 7 to 18 years.


4.2. Reliability and validity of the model


The study has examined the reliability and validity of the construct
and model by adopting the procedure recommended by Hair et al.
(2016). For checking the reliability and internal consistency, we com-
puted the values of CB alpha and CR. The threshold values of CR and CB
alpha of all constructs are higher than the threshold values of 0.70. The
validity of the construct has been ascertained by adopting the twofold

approach recommended by Hair et al. (2018). First we ascertained the
convergent validity by estimating the values of Average Variance
Extracted (AVE). The AVE values of all constructs are greater than 0.50
confirming convergent validity. Further, discriminant validity of the
construct has been ascertained by computing Fornell-Larcker criteria as
exhibited in Table 4. The square rooted values of AVE, shown in di-
agonal in Table 4, are greater than inter-construct correlations.


4.3. Hypotheses testing


The results of the hypotheses testing appear in Table 5. The results
show that IC (β=0.21, p = 0.001) has a profound positive impact on
OA. Further, results show that TAC (β=0.32, p = 0.000) significantly
mediates the relationship between IC and OA. The results of IC di-
mensions show that all three dimensions of IC, namely, HC (β=0.18,
p = 0.002), RC (β=0.31, p = 0.000), and SC (β=0.28, p = 0.004),
have a significant direct impact on OA. The results of mediation show
that absorptive capacity significantly mediates the relationship between
two out of three dimensions of IC (HC and RC). The value R square
shows that the strength of the model is moderate. Further, the results of
blindfolding (Q square 0.48) show the predictability of the model. In
condensed form, the findings reveal a significant impact of IC (overall
and by dimensions) on OA both directly and indirectly. The results of
the study concur with those of Stettner and Lavie (2014),
Mubarik et al. (2019), and Mubarik et al. (2016). These studies show
that improving knowledge, skills and abilities of firms' human resource
improves their capacity to absorb knowledge outside the firms, which
further contributes to both strands of performance that is, exploration
and exploitation. Likewise, Rasiah (2018) argues that both improving
HC and maintaining a collaborative relationship with customers and
suppliers enable firms to expand their horizons and their absorptive
capacity. These results explain the application of HC theory in the


context of IC, thus expanding its applicability. Although majority of the
studies explain how HC, RC and SC contribute to the absorptive capa-
city of a firm, researchers disagree about the direct impact of these
three dimensions on OA. For example Mubarik et al. (2019) claim that
HC has a direct association with firm performance; however firms
processes (operationalized as structural capital) and RC (oper-
ationalized as the relationship of a firm with its suppliers, employees
and customers) do not directly exert any effect on their OA. Never-
theless, according to Mubarik et al. (2019), these two dimensions
contribute in improving the capacity to absorb outside knowledge.


5. Conclusion, implications, and limitations


Industry 4.0, featuring digital technologies like the internet of things
(IoT), cloud computing, big-data, and cyber-physical systems, is radically
changing the conventional business processes. It improvesthe business
processes and makes them robust, autonomous, automated and in-
telligent. The change includes the incorporation of the latest technol-
ogies (e.g. blockchain), machines and infrastructure to create auto-
mated, seamless and interconnected networks of the firms. Further,
Industry 4.0 is also converting the organizational structures by digita-
lizing their end-to-end business processes. In such context, balancing
innovation and exploitation—the organization's ambidexterity—while
stepping into the fourth industrial revolution can be critical for an or-
ganization's capability. Industry 4.0 is the apex case of digital trans-
formation, and it is not limited to the application of advanced digital
gadgets and tools but is also about incorporating them into production
and business processes. It is important to note that Industry 4.0 is not
limited to the manufacturing sector but is equally applicable to the
service sector and thus has far-reaching economic and organizational
implications. The present study aims to go beyond the surface level to
understand the performance parameters of Industry 4.0 especially in
the context of Pakistan. The country is trying to leap-frog its transfor-
mation along the lines of Industry 4.0. Against this backdrop, the ob-
jective of this study was to examine the influence of IC (overall and by
dimensions) on the OA. Likewise, the study also investigated the role of
TAC between IC and OA. Our findings exhibit a profound influence of
overall IC and its components on OA. Likewise, our findings reveal a
significant mediating role of TAC in the relationship between IC and
OA. In short, the findings reveal an axial role of IC in maintaining a
balance between an organization's ability to explore and exploit. In this
context, the role of, TAC is critical. The TAC routes organization's IC
toward maintaining a balance between the activities of exploration and
exploitation.


Our findings offer important policy implications. First and foremost,
firms first have to introspect—evaluating their present position as
compared to Industry 4.0 requirements. A successful transformation to
Industry 4.0 requires a broad set of capabilities, pivotal among which is
OA, which can be best attained by strengthening the IC and improving
the capacity to absorb technology related knowledge. It requires orga-
nizations to re-examine their strategy for approaching IC.
Conventionally, organizations do not properly devise any specific
strategy to maintain and improve IC, leaving it at the mercy of others.
In such case, the IC, specific to the OA, may not be improved but rather
compromised. Our findings imply that organization should develop a
comprehensive IC development (ICD) strategy in synch with their other
business strategies. Execution of the ICD strategy can help organizations
to improve their productivity and innovation simultaneously. As a
matter of fact, incorporating a sense of ambidexterity in IC can provide
firms with a competitive edge. It implies that organizations should
develop HC, which possesses both the ability to ramp up productivity
and innovation. Likewise, firms should develop internal organizational
processes in a way that help these organizations to perform on both
market exploitation and exploration. The same is the case with RC.
Diffusing the ability of ambidexterity in relationships of an organization
with its suppliers, customers and employees could greatly help to attain

a balance between innovation and productivity.
The study has some limitations, the first and foremost being that the


study is static in nature. As we have collected cross-sectional data, the
collection of longitudinal data on the same concepts can provide a
better understanding of the IC-ambidexterity association. Second, the
study focuses on selected SMEs from the manufacturing sector of
Pakistan. Hence the generalizability of the results needs to be done with
care.
