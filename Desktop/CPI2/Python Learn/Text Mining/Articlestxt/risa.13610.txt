Adoption of a Data-Driven Bayesian Belief Network
Investigating Organizational Factors that Influence
Patient Safety


Mecit Can Emre Simsekler 1,2,∗ and Abroon Qazi 3


Medical errors pose high risks to patients. Several organizational factors may impact the high
rate of medical errors in complex and dynamic healthcare systems. However, limited research
is available regarding probabilistic interdependencies between the organizational factors and
patient safety errors. To explore this, we adopt a data-driven Bayesian Belief Network (BBN)
model to represent a class of probabilistic models, using the hospital-level aggregate survey
data from U.K. hospitals. Leveraging the use of probabilistic dependence models and visual
features in the BBN model, the results shed new light on relationships existing among eight
organizational factors and patient safety errors. With the high prediction capability, the data-
driven approach results suggest that “health and well-being” and “bullying and harassment in
the work environment” are the two leading factors influencing the number of reported errors
and near misses affecting patient safety. This study provides significant insights to understand
organizational factors’ role and their relative importance in supporting decision-making and
safety improvements.

1. INTRODUCTION


Medical errors pose significant risks to patients
in healthcare. Since the U.S. Institute of Medicine
(IoM) published their pioneer safety report, which
shows up to 98,000 people dying as a consequence of
preventable medical errors (Kohn, Corrigan, & Don-
aldson, 2000), substantial efforts have been made to
improve the situation (Gandhi et al., 2018; Jones,

Vaux, & Olsson-Brown, 2019). However, recent stud-
ies still show that medical errors are among the lead-
ing causes of deaths, which only in the U.S. estimated
over 250,000 deaths in a year (Makary & Daniel,
2016).


Such medical errors occur within the dynamic
and complex healthcare delivery systems due to sev-
eral organizational factors (Simsekler, Gurses, Smith,
& Ozonoff, 2019). To identify such factors, earlier
studies evaluated the working conditions as well
as staff experiences and observations concerning
teamwork (Wooldridge et al., 2020), communication
(Peadon, Hurley, & Hutchinson, 2020; Wooldridge,
Carayon, Shaffer, & Eagan, 2018), safety climate
(Aljabri et al., 2020; Simsekler, 2019), risk practice
(Kaya, Ward, Pearman, & Clarkson, 2019a, 2020),
and near miss event reporting (Patterson & Pace,
2016), among others. While these studies focused
solely on individual factors, they also highlighted

possible dependencies among the factors within the
complex systems. Earlier studies also noted that var-
ious measurement instruments are available (Kris-
tensen, 2016) to explore the organizational factors,
mainly in the form of cross-sectional surveys (The
Health Foundation, 2011). However, it is impor-
tant to note that each tool has unique cultural do-
mains, and they experience certain limitations when
it comes to data validity and reliability (Campione,
Yount, & Sorra, 2018; Meddings et al., 2017). Fur-
ther, earlier studies revealed that the limited use of
statistical approaches might have failed to identify
complex relationships between multidimensional or-
ganizational factors and patient safety (Reis, Paiva,
& Sousa, 2018).


These concerns have led us to adopt a data-
driven Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) model to
help explore organizational factors that may influ-
ence patient safety. Being at the intersection between
statistics and machine learning, a BBN model rep-
resents either causal probabilistic relationships or
statistical dependencies among interconnected vari-
ables. Further, when BBN features are exploited, the
analysis goes beyond basic data analysis and poten-
tially reveals deeper insights, probabilistic outcomes,
and valuable findings.


Identifying organizational factors that contribute
to patient safety errors is vital toward knowing how
to provide sustainable safety improvements. The pri-
mary purpose of this article is to evaluate the rela-
tionship between organizational factors and reported
error rates related to patient safety and establish the
relative importance of the factors through the lens of
BBNs. In this study, our intention is not to test spe-
cific hypotheses, but rather to explore organizational
factors and their probabilistic dependencies on the
safety outcome.


The outline of the paper is as follows: The lit-
erature review on organizational factors and patient
safety, and BBNs is presented in Section 2. The
methodology is explained in Section 3. The results
and interpretations are presented in Section 4. The
implications of our study are discussed in Section 5.
Finally, conclusions, study limitations, and future re-
search directions are revealed in Section 6.


2. LITERATURE REVIEW


2.1. Organizational Factors and Medical Errors


Various factors may play a role in the occur-
rence of incidents in different industries and do-


mains (Årstad & Aven, 2017; Aven & Ylönen, 2018).
Healthcare is not exceptional where medical errors
occur within complex healthcare delivery systems
due to limited communication, safety culture, risk
practice, among other factors (Ellahham, Ellahham,
& Simsekler, 2019; Kaya, Ward, & Clarkson, 2019b;
Meddings et al., 2017; Simsekler, Qazi, Alalami, El-
lahham, & Ozonoff, 2020). Further, it should be
noted that such factors may affect patients as well
as healthcare providers. In fact, healthcare providers
are at a higher risk of experiencing injuries than
in many other industries (Aljabri et al., 2020). The
providers are threatened by burnout, pain, and even
the risk of disease or injury—factors that inhibit
their ability to maintain consistent, high-quality care
(Dressner, 2017). While providers’ well-being may
trigger undesired safety-related events, the fragile na-
ture of safety culture may also be among the key fac-
tors that can influence safety errors (Flin, 2007).


Using surveys and questionnaires, valuable in-
sights have been captured between the organiza-
tional factors and patient safety-related measures
(Patterson & Pace, 2016). For instance, Kristensen
(2016) evaluated 33 questionnaires used for the
safety culture measurement, including a range of
organizational factors. Hospital Survey on Patient
Safety Culture (HSOPSC) (Jones, Skinner, Xu, Sun,
& Mueller, 2008), Patient Safety Culture in Health-
care Organizations (PSCHO) (Singer et al., 2007),
Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ) (Sexton et al.,
2006), Manchester Patient Safety Assessment Frame-
work (MAPSAF) (Parker, Kirk, Claridge, Lawrie, &
Ashcroft, 2007), Safety Organizing Scale (SOS) (Vo-
gus & Sutcliffe, 2007), and British National Health
Service (NHS) Staff Surveys (NHS SCC, 2019) are
among the most common tools capturing the expe-
rience of healthcare providers to reveal insights on
organizational factors in this particular healthcare
safety context.


Among the most common approaches discussed
above is HSOPSC used in over 60 countries (Ble-
gen, Gearhart, O’Brien, Sehgal, & Alldredge, 2009)
to measure teamwork, communication, manager sup-
port, and others (Waterson, Carman, Manser, &
Hammer, 2019) as possible organizational factors
affecting patient safety. A recent comprehensive
review brought together various healthcare stud-
ies from 21 countries from 2007 to 2016, utilizing
HSOPSC (Reis et al., 2018). The study showed sig-
nificant variations in the results. While some studies
concluded that “teamwork within hospital units” was
the most important dimension (Blegen et al., 2009;






Adoption of a Data-Driven Bayesian Belief Network Investigating Organizational Factors 3


Bodur & Filiz, 2010; Hellings, Schrooten, Klazinga,
& Vleugels, 2007), others found “organizational
learning and continuous improvement” to be more
strongly correlated with safety errors (Al-Ahmadi,
2009; Bagnasco et al., 2011; Nie et al., 2013). In con-
trast, according to the study by Abdelhai, Abdelaziz,
and Ghanem (2012), “overall perceptions of patient
safety” was the most prominent dimension.


The studies discussed above reveal that various
organizational factors play a role in the patient safety
context underlying medical errors. Therefore, health-
care provider experience as a component can com-
prehensively capture such factors within the complex
healthcare environments. Recent studies support this
idea by suggesting that provider experience needs
to be addressed due to its close association with the
quality of care and safety (Lee, Seo, Hladkyj, Lovell,
& Schwartzmann, 2013). It is also worth noting that
given the complex and dynamic nature of health-
care systems, the use of experience can allow for the
identification of safety beliefs, attitudes, and work-
force behaviors thoroughly (Kouabenan, Ngueutsa,
& Mbaye, 2015; Liu et al., 2015). Moreover, staff ex-
perience may also identify the root causes that trig-
ger safety outcomes, such as incidents and injuries
(Fernández-Muñiz, Montes-Peón, & Vázquez-Ordás,
2007).


The systematic review by Reis et al. (2018) also
reveals the limited nature of the statistical analyses
of healthcare safety data. For instance, only two of
the 33 surveys (6%) investigated the effect of mul-
tiple survey dimensions on the patient safety using
regression models (Al-Ahmadi, 2009; Smits et al.,
2012). While Al-Ahmadi (2009) used a linear regres-
sion analysis to investigate the association between
the event reporting and safety culture components,
Smits et al. (2012) analyzed the data using a multi-
level logistic regression analysis. It must be stressed
that most studies focused solely on a single organi-
zational factor or some without simultaneously con-
sidering all factors in a probabilistic setting. There-
fore, their potential interdependencies have not been
discussed with the use of probabilistic and graphical
models. In order to explore this, the use of power-
ful tools, such as BBN models, may significantly help
with predicting the relationships as well as identify-
ing the relative importance of organizational factors
to the patient safety outcomes.


2.2. Bayesian Belief Networks


BBNs are probabilistic graphical models that can
quantify and display complex relationships among


variables (Salini & Kenett, 2009; Sener, Barut, Dag,
& Yildirim, 2019a). A BBN model comprises a set of
nodes representing variables and arcs that either rep-
resent causal relationships or statistical dependencies
among interconnected variables (Hanea, McBride,
Burgman, & Wintle, 2018). The strength of depen-
denices among interconnected variables is captured
in the form of probability distributions. In earlier
studies, BBN models have been used in a wide range
of application areas such as project management
(de Oliveira, Possamai, Dalla Valentina, & Flesch,
2012), business ethics (Ekici & Önsel, 2013), sup-
ply chain management (Sener, Barut, Oztekin, Av-
cilar, & Yildirim, 2019b), new product development
(Chin, Tang, Yang, Wong, & Wang, 2009), and others.
BBNs have been extensively explored in decision-
making under risk and uncertainty due to their abil-
ity to generate and assess the impact of different
what-if scenarios. Some of the risk and uncertainty-
related application areas include eruption forecasting
(Christophersen et al., 2018), climate change assess-
ment (Hanea et al., 2018), coastal risk analysis (Jäger,
Christie, Hanea, den Heijer, & Spencer, 2018), risk
assessment in process plants (Ale et al., 2014), and
others (Adedipe, Shafiee, & Zio, 2020; Aven, 2016).


Earlier studies identified a range of benefits as-
sociated with the use of BBNs (Cugnata, Kenett, &
Salini, 2016). First, the graphical representation of
the problem provides an opportunity for stakehold-
ers to visualize complex interactions among different
variables (Hanea, Kurowicka, & Cooke, 2006). Sec-
ond, probabilistic reasoning, a key notion in risk and
uncertainty analysis (Aven, 2017, 2018; Shortridge,
Aven, & Guikema, 2017), is captured in a simplis-
tic manner and distributed through the model, and
past beliefs on uncertain variables are efficiently up-
dated with the evidence against distinct sources in
the network (Jäger et al., 2018). Third, uncertainty
in reasoning is considered, and the (in)dependence
relationships are identified (Qazi, Dikmen, & Bir-
gonul, 2020a). All these can be achieved with even
limited empirical data (Hanea et al., 2006). Despite
these benefits, there are some shortcomings of the
method to note. For instance, when data are not
available, the development and quantification of a
model using expert judgment is quite challenging
(Hanea, Morales Napoles, & Ababei, 2015; Werner,
Bedford, Cooke, Hanea, & Morales-Nápoles, 2017;
Hanea et al., 2018). Another limitation relates to
avoiding any feedback loops in the model, implying
that the BBN model must be structured as an acyclic
graph (Nielsen & Jensen, 2007). Moreover, the soft-
ware used to develop the network may have a limited






4 Simsekler and Qazi


capability to work with continuous variables, which
might then be discretized; therefore, this may capture
limited information on the original variable distribu-
tion (Qazi et al., 2020a).


BBNs provide a visual ability for users and
decision-makers to establish the propagation impact
of variables in a network setting (Lawrence, Ibne
Hossain, Jaradat, & Hamilton, 2020). For instance,
BBN models can help visualize how a variable influ-
ences other variables across a network in the event of
its mitigation or realization (Kelangath, Das, Quigley,
& Hirdaris, 2012). This assessment of the network-
wide propagation impact of individual variables can
lead to prioritizing and managing critical variables
(Kabir & Papadopoulos, 2019). Both expert judg-
ment and data can be utilized for developing a BBN
model (Hanea et al., 2018). In this article, we use a
data-driven approach for developing a BBN model.


While BBNs have been successfully explored in
various application areas, their potential contribution
has not been evaluated in the patient safety context
yet. It is, therefore, aimed to explore the application
of BBNs in the patient safety field with a unique
survey data-set. Using the research methodology in
Section 3, our goal is to identify the probabilistic de-
pendencies among organizational factors and patient
safety errors.


3. METHODOLOGY


3.1. Data Sources


Our data source is the British NHS staff survey
data. With the availability of the data, we analyzed
the following eight factors in the survey that could be
related to patient safety: (X1) equality, diversity, and
inclusion; (X2) health and well-being; (X3) immedi-
ate managers; (X4) quality of care; (X5) safety culture;
(X6) team working; (X7) safe environment—bullying
and harassment (b&h); and (X8) safe environment—
violence. Within these factors, there are 32 specific
survey items. Table I lists all the factors, along with
the patient safety error variable. Further informa-
tion on the specific survey items can be found in Ap-
pendix Table AI.


As shown in the unit/remarks column in Table I,
all factors (X1–X8) are scored on a scale between
0 and 10 points, which is primarily made available
by NHS for hospitals to benchmark their grades
with others (NHS SCC, 2019). Responses for the
contributing questions from each hospital were

rescored to fit this scale by NHS. Each theme within
the survey representing an organizational factor
(see Table I) has a unique calculation. For instance,
equality, diversity, and inclusion (X1) has been fed by
four questions (see Table A.I). All participants who
have responded to two of the questions or more get
allocated an overall score that is the average score of
their rescored questions. Each organizational factor’s
score is the average score of all participants’ overall
scores (NHS SSCC, 2019). As the outcome measure,
we use the same survey data on the reported number
of safety incidents that could have harmed patients
(X9, item q16b). The calculation of this outcome
measure is based on the percentage of staff selecting
“yes” out of those who responded to the question
from the respective hospital. It should be noted that
a higher score provides a more favorable result for
organizational factors, while it is the opposite for the
target variable (patient safety errors).


It should be noted that hospitals may have differ-
ent characteristics; therefore, hospital-level compari-
son may be limited in prediction and feature impor-
tance analyses. However, to prevent such issues, the
survey data have primarily been weighted by NHS
considering the occupational group weight, trust size
weight, and the combination of these two weights
(NHS SCC, 2019). The weighting procedure aims to
ensure that no organization appears worse or better
than others due to disparities in trust sizes and occu-
pational groups. For instance, the calculation for trust
size weight is made for all trusts participating in the
study. The trust size weight is calculated by dividing
the total number of eligible staff by the number of re-
spondents. For the calculation of occupational group
weight, the first step is to calculate the proportion

second step is to calculate the average proportion
of each occupational group within each benchmark

mark group proportion (step 2) by the trust propor-
tion (step 3). Finally, the combined weight is calcu-
lated by multiplying the occupational group weight
with the trust size weight. Further information and
examples on the staff survey methodology and meth-
ods used for weighting scores can be found on the
NHS Staff Survey website (NHS SCC, 2019).

As shown in Table III, the intercorrelation anal-
ysis of organizational factors using the Spearman’s

was carried out to examine the statistical properties
and test each coefficient’s significance using p-values.
Results showed that the relationships between each

As discussed earlier, we adopt a data-driven
BBN model to investigate the probabilistic depen-
dencies between the organizational factors and

patient safety errors. A BBN model comprises the
following elements:


• a set of variables along with directed edges be-
tween variables forming a directed acyclic graph
(Shakeri, Zarei, Azar, & Maleki Minbash Raz-
gah, 2020). A directed graph is acyclic if no di-
rected path is available: X1 → . . . → Xn so that
X1 = Xn. Further, the directed edges represent
statistical associations in a data-driven BBN as
the primary approach in developing the model
in this study.


• a conditional probability table P(Xi|pa(Xi)) at-
tached to each variable Xi with parents pa(Xi).
For instance, if there is an arc leading from each
of X2, X7, and X8 (organizational factors) to X9
(target variable), X2, X7, and X8 are classified as
the parents of X9.


In the BBN with a specification over U =
X1 , . . . , X9, factoring joint probabilities are obtained
through the chain rule of probability theory resulting
from the calculations conducted under certain prob-
ability states. The value of a particular node is condi-
tional solely on its parent nodes’ values in the BBN
model. Thus, the unique joint probability distribu-
tion, P(U ) represents the product of all conditional
probability tables with the given Equation (1) below:


P (U) =
9∏


i=1
P (Xi|pa (Xi)) (1)


The adoption of a discrete data-driven BBN
model includes the discretization of the survey
data, selection of states for each organizational fac-
tor and patient safety errors, and establishing the
strength of interdependency across interconnected
variables. Many software packages, such as Hugin,
AgenaRisk, Netica, and GeNIe, are available to
adopt a data-driven approach (Cox, Popken, & Sun,


2018) while using several algorithms such as Naive
Bayes, Bayesian Search (BS), PC, and Greedy Thick
Thinning (GTT), among others (BayesFusion, 2017;
Kelangath et al., 2012). These algorithms can be clas-
sified into constraint-based and score-based methods.
The constraint-based methods, such as the PC algo-
rithm, employ conditional independence statements
to generate a network using data (Kelangath et al.,
2012). On the other hand, the score-based methods,
such as the GTT algorithm, create and score several
network structures and finally select the structure
with the highest score (Ekici & Önsel Ekici, 2019).
The prediction accuracy of such data-driven models
(Ekici & Önsel Ekici, 2019; Kelangath et al., 2012)
can be ascertained using the Equation (2) below:


Accuracy = number of correct predictions
total number of records


(2)


We developed our model in GeNIe 2.0 while
adopting a uniform width discretization scheme, as
proposed by Ekici and Önsel Ekici (2019). Further,
we tested three different algorithms utilizing a mix
of constraint-based algorithm (PC) and score-based
algorithms (GTT and BS), in two various discretiza-
tion schemes, two and three states. This procedure
was adopted to establish the sensitivity of the re-
sults to the choice of algorithms and discretization
states and to optimize the model for further analy-
sis. As a result of this, the confusion matrix was con-
structed for the model providing the best possible
prediction capability. A confusion matrix is an output
of a validation process that represents the relation-
ship between actual and predicted states associated
with a model. The BBN model was validated through
a k-fold cross-validation scheme (Marcot & Hanea,
2020) available in GeNIe (BayesFusion, 2017) that
includes dividing a data-set into k parts of equal size,
training the network developed on k-1 parts, and test-
ing it on the last kth part. The process is repeated k
times with a different part of the data selected for
each testing iteration (Qazi, Dikmen, & Birgonul,
2020b). The results were found to be insensitive to
the increase in k beyond 6. Following this, the dis-
crete probability distribution of factors influencing
patient safety errors was represented in the BBN
model.


The results of the model and relative importance
of factors contributing to the patient safety errors are
presented in further detail in the next section.

As discussed in the procedure above, different
network structures were developed using three algo-
rithms. Figs. 1, 2, and 3 show the network structures
related to the use of PC, BS, and GTT algorithms,
respectively. As shown in each figure, the algorithms
presented nine variables, including organizational
factors and patient safety errors, with various arcs.

into two and three states, respectively. As shown in
Table V, PC outperformed the other two algorithms
with the 78% prediction accuracy, one of the earliest
and most popular algorithms introduced by Spirtes,
Glymour, and Scheines (1993). Therefore, the re-
maining procedure is adopted through this specific
algorithm in a three-state discretization scheme. Al-
though the prediction accuracy of PC was not signifi-
cantly greater compared to other algorithms, it was
deemed appropriate to utilize the same algorithm-
based model in our analysis due to its successful
adoption in other application areas (Kelangath et al.,
2012; Qazi & Dikmen, 2019).


The confusion matrix in Table VI shows the as-
sociation between the actual and predicted states for
the PC algorithm in detail. The numbers shown in
bold represent the correct predictions. For instance,
out of 413 records tested in the validation stage, 322
were correctly diagnosed with an accuracy of 78%.


The probability distribution of organizational
factors associated with patient safety errors is shown
in Fig. 4b. Regarding this model, it can be said that
13% of the cases were associated with the state 3
(high) of patient safety errors. The underlying dis-
tribution was highly skewed in the case of diversity
and safe environment—b&h, while others were nor-
mally distributed. The model (see Fig. 4b) was then
analyzed for the low (see Fig. 4a) and high state (see
Fig. 4c) of patient safety errors to evaluate the change
across variables in the network.


The impact assessment across the organiza-
tional factors given the low and high state of patient
safety errors is summarized in Fig. 5a and Fig. 5b,
respectively. Overall, results showed that “health and
well-being” and “safe environment—bullying and

harassment” are the two leading critical factors in the
back propagation impact assessment given the low
and high state of patient safety errors.


The relative importance of individual factors was
also established by assessing the change in the proba-
bility distribution of patient safety errors concerning
the realization of each factor’s extreme states. Vul-
nerability (resilience) of a factor represents its im-


pact on a target variable associated with the realiza-
tion of the worst (best) possible state of the factor
(Hosseini & Ivanov, 2019). The assessment of the vul-
nerability and resilience potential of individual fac-
tors can help prioritize factors for developing strate-
gies to enhance (mitigate) resilience (vulnerabil-
ity) (Aven, 2011, 2019). “Safe environment—bullying
and harassment” was identified as the most critical

factor relative to its adverse impact on the target
variable since it yielded the highest net increase in
the probability (35%) associated with patient safety
errors (see Fig. 6a). In contrast, “health and well-
being” significantly reduced the probability of pa-
tient safety errors resulting in the highest net reduc-
tion in the probability (26%) associated with patient
safety errors (see Fig. 6b). Other factors were found
to be relatively noncritical. This implies that risk
managers and policymakers may prioritize “health
and well-being” to realize significant benefits to the
safety program. However, they may want to de-
velop risk mitigation strategies to reduce the nega-
tive impact of “bullying and harassment” in the work
environment.


We also conducted the Spearman’s correlation
test to establish the association between the two
ranking schemes relative to the realization of the ex-
treme states of individual factors (see Table VII).
The two ranking schemes can help establish whether
these organizational factors possess the same rela-
tive importance in relation to their vulnerability and
resilience potential (Qazi & Khan, 2020). The as-
sociation is found to be statistically nonsignificant,
which implies that the optimal choice of risk miti-
gation strategies is contingent on individual factors’
vulnerability and resilience potential. In other words,
an effective strategy can only be developed after ex-
ploring statistical dependencies among multidimen-

our results revealed that the organizational factors,

(X4) quality of care; (X5) safety culture; (X6) team
working, (X7) safe environment—bullying and ha-
rassment; and (X8) safe environment—violence, have
a statistically significant relationship with the patient
safety errors. These factors were then fed into the
BBN model to explore their interdependencies and
relative importance towards patient safety errors.


Based on the results, our model concludes that health
and well-being (X2), and bullying and harassment in
the work environment (X7) are the two leading fac-
tors driving the number of reported errors and near
misses affecting patient safety.


In the literature, these factors have been iden-
tified as contributing factors to the safety risks in

various industries, including healthcare. Specifically,
work-related stress (e.g., burnout) is a trending topic
that its role on patient and provider safety has been
investigated widely in various healthcare settings
(Tawfik et al., 2018; Yassi & Hancock, 2005). For
instance, earlier studies showed that burnout con-
tributes to emotional exhaustion and detached feel-
ings towards patients (Koukoulaki et al., 2017; Lee
et al., 2013). This may explain the strong relation-
ship between health and well-being factor and patient
safety errors that we found in this study. Therefore,
it can be recommended that increased psychological
and emotional support to the provider may lead to
improved patient safety.


Bullying and harassment in the work environ-
ment is an interesting factor to be found as a critical
one affecting patient safety. Although it could be
assumed that such an inappropriate environment
would affect the healthcare providers’ psychological
and physical health (Vessey, Demarco, & DiFazio,
2010) as well as financial costs (Kline & Lewis, 2019),
it seems this also impacts patient safety outcomes
(Chipps, Stelmaschuk, Albert, Bernhard, & Hollo-
man, 2013; Felblinger, 2008; Johnson et al., 2019).
For instance, a study identified bullying as an impor-
tant factor and a “hidden threat” to patient safety
and suggested strategies and initiatives to prevent
such inappropriate behaviors (Longo & Hain, 2014).






12 Simsekler and Qazi


Further, recent empirical studies in Korean and
Saudi hospitals also showed the relationship be-
tween bullying and nurse-assessed patient safety
outcomes (Al Omar, Salam, & Al-Surimi, 2019; Oh,
Uhm, & Yoon, 2016).


This study has made two unique contributions:
(1) evaluating organizational factors and their influ-
ence on patient safety errors; and (2) adopting a
data-driven BBN approach to provide significant in-
sights on the relative importance of the factors. To
our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating a
BBN-based approach in this particular safety con-
text. Identifying the importance of organizational
factors is essential for organizations to drive safety
improvement. In this study, it is important to note
that the data-driven BBN model has revealed some
valuable insights regarding the factors’ relative im-
portance, a central area of uncertainty in risk as-
sessment (Aven, 2016). As earlier studies showed
(McAfee & Brynjolfsson, 2012), there is an associa-
tion between data use in the decision-making process
and operational performance. This study also high-
lighted the use of data by adopting the BBN model
to support decision-making in this interesting rela-
tionship between organizational factors and medical
errors.


Further, it is noteworthy to mention that the rela-
tive importance of individual factors was established
through change assessment in the probability distri-
bution of patient safety errors regarding the realiza-
tion of individual factors’ extreme states. In terms
of the prediction capability, the chosen PC algorithm
achieved a classification accuracy of 78% in a three-
state discretization scheme. Our findings revealed
that healthcare organizations should improve organi-
zational factors that their providers experience in the
work environment to accelerate patient safety im-
provement. It is, nonetheless, important for not only
organizations but also policymakers, such as govern-
ments, to support the important factors’ development
with appropriate policy implementations (Jain, Leka,
& Zwetsloot, 2018).


This study offers significant insights for risk prac-
titioners and researchers to understand the impact of
organizational factors on safety-related performance
measures. Starting with the most important organiza-
tional factors, healthcare organizations can improve
their capabilities to reduce the number of errors
affecting patient safety. Exploiting the data-driven
BBN model, individual organizations may also de-
termine the most important factors affecting their


safety outcomes. Exploring the interrelation between
organizational factors and quantitative safety perfor-
mances may offer further motivations to investigate
such capabilities’ strengths and limitations. For in-
stance, safety and risk managers may identify the
underlying reasons behind work-related stress and
bullying to obtain positive results relative to patient
safety. This study may also help to see the importance
of data in this particular field. Although the survey is
a commonly used approach for data collection and
analysis in this specific context, they have not been
used with the help of data-driven approaches, such
as BBN models, to demonstrate and analyze inter-
relations among the variables visually. The realistic
results may encourage the healthcare managers to
motivate data collection to improve the quality of
analysis and knowledge gained.


6. CONCLUSIONS


This study identified organizational factors that
have a significant effect on patient safety errors.
Although a range of factors affect safety perfor-
mance, it is vital for practicing risk and safety man-
agers to prioritize them regarding their importance.
This, therefore, requires the identification of the
most important factors to add more value to the
safety improvement process. Besides, the potential
interactions among the organizational factors and
safety errors are explored to provide interesting in-
sights to both researchers and practitioners.


Utilizing the hospital-level aggregate survey data
from the U.K. hospitals, adoption of the BBN model
revealed that health and well-being (X2), and bul-
lying and harassment in the work environment (X7)
are the leading factors driving safety errors. Future
studies may benefit from using the same methodol-
ogy in a specific healthcare unit or organization. Fu-
ture research may also evaluate and integrate other
traditional or machine learning approaches to com-
pare prediction capabilities and possible disparities
in the relative importance of the organizational fac-
tors. It would also be interesting to collect data not
only from providers but also from patients to in-
vestigate how patient experience is related to safety
outcomes.


Our study has some limitations that may give a
caution to interpret and generalize the results. First,
this study is based on the hospital-level aggregate
data; therefore, specific units and hospitals may have
differences in the relative importance ranking of the






Adoption of a Data-Driven Bayesian Belief Network Investigating Organizational Factors 13


organizational factors. Second, the study is based on
the data from the U.K. hospitals; therefore, the gen-
eralizability and transferability of the results to other
industries and countries may be limited. Therefore,
future research might also consider replicating this
study in different healthcare settings or industries
to help create a more holistic conclusion regarding
the interdependencies between organizational fac-
tors and safety errors.
