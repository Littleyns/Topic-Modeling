Abstract 


Twitter is one of the most comprehensive sources of public conversations over the world. As a platform, it provides a medium to a 
large group of audience to express their views and opinions. Owing to the snowballing of the cheaper smartphone market coupled 
with cheaper data services, the platform has experienced an enormous increase in its use and has become a good medium of 
influence. Hence, Twitter data i.e. around 1.1 lakh tweets over a period of three months (January to March, 2019) are used to extract 
the tweets surrounding the discussion of future of work which is the result of the emerging technologies vis-à-vis automation, IoT 
and Industry 4.0. to understand the perceptions of people, organizations and businesses regarding the same. Furthermore, themes 
surrounding the discussions are identified and technology enablers that are perceived to bring about a change in the future of work. 
The social media discussions can strongly influence the opinions and perceptions of people, businesses or organizations regarding 
Future of Work. The results of sentiment analysis exhibit that there is not much negative sentiment regarding the change in nature 
of work. Artificial Intelligence and Robotics are identified as the main technology enablers.

1. Introduction 


The advent of new technologies always put an impact on the nature of work and this impact is being studied 
by considering the three viewpoints - the “This time is different” scenario, the “This time is no different” scenario and

the “conservative” scenario [1,6]. All the three scenarios are discussed with respect to employment predictions and 
changes in corresponding policies along with a literature study of the background history forming the base of research 
or discussion. While any advancement in technology leads to increased efficiency, productivity, safety and 
convenience, it also raises questions about its impact on skills, jobs, wages and nature of work itself [21,27,28,30]. 
For example, automation is expected to ease out work in labor-intensive jobs not only in product-oriented businesses 
but also in the service sector. Hence, there is always a speculation that automation may lead to loss of such jobs. 
However, many industry leaders and technology experts believe that this would only open new opportunities – 
building new job profiles [9]. Hence, the required shift in workforce can be catered to with re-training and re-
development of labor [2,3]. In the past, ICT technologies and digitalization have transformed the world of work. 
Considering the same, it becomes imperative to analyze whether automation, IoT, artificial intelligence and the other 
emerging technologies also have the capability to do so and how are they perceived to shape the future of work. 


The term ‘Industry 4.0’ circumscribes the fifth Industrial revolution – one that marries advanced 
manufacturing techniques with the Internet of Things to create manufacturing systems that are not only interconnected, 
but communicate, analyze, and use information to drive further intelligent action back in the physical world. Several 
facts have dominated the discussion on the changing nature of work due to the advent of concept of Industry 4.0. 
Technology is blurring the boundaries of the firm and hence shaping the skills needed for work. The idea of robots 
replacing workers is striking a nerve [3]. Thus, it has become of prime importance to study and analyze the perception 
of organizations, businesses and industries with respect to the future of work [5]. This has created a lot of debates 
surrounding learning, unlearning, relearning, employment, retrenchment and other surrounding issues on employee 
management in this wave of digital transformation [18,25,28].  


Traditionally, any adjustments in the administration approaches were customarily spread and talked about in 
customary media like papers or news channels, but the recent increase in the use of social media has changed the 
landscape. These days when individuals need to share anything, social media platforms are the go-to place and Twitter 
has risen as a stage where individuals are meeting up to talk about their issues, encounters and so on. As of late even 
MNCs have comprehended the significance of such platforms and continuously attempting to connect with the clients 
through official Twitter handles. Not only it is a comparatively cheaper way, but at the same time it also allows a 
quicker spread of information and ensuring it reaches a substantial number of people. As can be seen, boundless 
surveys and interviews to gauge public suppositions is tormented with various issues like being resource intensive, 
time consuming, statistic assorted variety, measure of information, validness and so forth. In such a situation, an 
attempt to utilize Twitter to extract information with respect to their perspectives about the impact of emerging 
technologies vis-à-vis automation, IoT and Industry 4.0 on the Future of Work are to be comprehended as the main 
drivers responsible to bring about this change. 
1.1 Objectives of the study are as follows 
  


 To identify major topics of discussion surrounding Future of Work (FoW). 
 To understand public participation through retweets surrounding FoW tweets. 
 To understand the sentiments surrounding social media discussions on FoW. 
 To understand the main topics generated among the discussions on FoW. 
 To understand the technological enablers of FoW using summarized user generated content. 


2. Literature Review 


Knowledge extraction through social media has opened new avenues for research in Future of work because of 
pervasive mobile computing, faster networks and ebullition of social media platforms [4,6,8,10]. Twitter has been 
significantly used in recent years for research in elections & politics [10], healthcare [8], blockchain adoption & 
diffusion [11,12], emergency response services [16], consumer psychology & brand management [17] etc.   


Understanding of emerging trends and themes on future of work can be understood through current discussions on 
social media platforms. Artificial Intelligence and its applications have eased the amount of efforts and labor needed 
to put by humans earlier and has enhanced work dimensions in scalable form. Evolutionary AI algorithms [15] 
mimicking natural phenomenon has enhanced the computational efficiency as well as opened exciting avenues in 
automation and Robotics [9].  


As there are two sides of every coin, Future of Work [27,28,30] is exhilarating as well as challenging to many. It 
entirely depends upon how humans are perceiving the technology and their discussions surrounding social media.

Tweets can be a very helpful resource for knowledge extraction regarding Future of Work [10,11,12,13]. Extracted 
knowledge can be inferred from the themes extracted and analyzed statistically [4].  


3. Methodology   


About 1.1 lakh tweets are extracted for a period of three months from January 2019 to March 2019. The extracted 
twitter data is then cleaned to remove the URLs, whitespaces, stop-words, etc. The cleaned data is further used for 
sentiment analysis i.e. to identify the sentiments of the future of work among the people, organizations and businesses. 
The polarity of the tweets is also categorized into Positive, Neutral and Negative. Further, the LDA algorithm is used 
to identify 15 topics with 15 terms each [8,10]. Later, the topics are categorized [19,22,23,20] to identify the themes 
and different probable scenarios of future of work. Also, the different drivers that are mainly responsible for bringing 
about the change in future of work are identified and analyzed [18,22,24,29]. Following are the steps undertaken for 
causal knowledge extraction on future of work using Twitter [7,8,10]:  


3.1 Data Collection  
Data is extracted from the Twitter API using R (RStudio). Around 1.1 lakh tweets with relevant hashtags and of 


English language are collected. As IoT, Industry 4.0, Automation and Artificial Intelligence are the emerging 
technologies which are expected to shape the future of work, corresponding hashtags along with that of Future of Work 
are used for data extraction. Hashtags which are undertaken for data collection are as follows #futureofwork, 
#industry4.0, #iot, #automation, #ai  


3.2 Data Cleaning  
The extracted Twitter data is cleaned to remove the punctuations, numbers, stop-words, white spaces, URLs, etc. 


so that it could be used for further analysis. The cleaned data was then used for Descriptive Analysis, Sentiment 
Analysis and Topic Modelling.   


3.4 Descriptive Analysis  
The cleaned data is used to construct the Word-cloud to understand the most frequent words in the data sample, 


where the word with the highest frequency will have the highest font size and so on. In addition to this, a Retweet 
analysis is performed to understand when the frequency of tweets is the highest and the ratio of original tweets to 
retweets at any given point of time.  


The ‘word-cloud’, ‘ggplot2’, ‘readr’, ‘lubridate’, ‘syuzhet’ and ‘plyr’ libraries are used for the Descriptive Analysis.  
3.4 Sentiment Analysis  
The cleaned data is then used to identify the polarity of the tweets by calculating the sentiment score for every 


individual tweet. The polarity of the words in a tweet is decided by using a collection of positive words and negative 
words. Thus, for every tweet the positive and negative scores are calculated which are further used to calculate the 
Sentiment score as follows:  


Sentiment Score = Positive Score – Negative Score.  
3.5 Topic Modelling  
The same corpus is used to form the TDM (Term Document Matrix). Here, 15 topics with 15 words each are 


identified using the LDA Algorithm and Correlated Topic Model (CTM). The ‘topic-models’ library is used for this 
purpose.  


3.6 ANOVA to understand Technology Enablers for Future of Work  
On analyzing the different topics and their corresponding themes from the extracted tweets using Topic Modelling, 


the different technologies that may act as or are perceived to act as the enablers of Future of Work are identified. 
ANOVA is a statistical technique that is used to determine whether the means of two or more samples or groups are 
significantly different from each other. It is used to check the impact of one or more variables or factors by simply 
comparing the means of the samples or groups. The F-statistic or F-ratio measures whether the means of different 
groups are similar or not. Lower the value of F-ratio, more similar are the means of the groups and vice versa.  


For checking which of the groups or samples have different means, the Bonferroni approach is used and t-test (Two 
sample assuming equal variances) for every pair of sample or group is performed. This will help in determining which 
of the samples or groups belong to the same population.   


 
4. Results & Discussion   


Knowledge extraction from twitter data is performed by steps mentioned below:  


4  Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000–000  
 


4.1 Descriptive Analysis  


4.1.1 Word-Cloud  
 Exploratory data analysis is performed by constructing a word-cloud with the sample data of approximately 1.11 


lakh tweets. We created the word-cloud of maximum 250 words with a minimum frequency of 100 ranging across all 
the tweets. The words with the highest frequency have the maximum font size while those with low frequencies have 
a decreased font size.  


  
Figure 1: Future of Work - Word Cloud of all tweets  


  
From the word-cloud, it is very much evident that the words ‘robot’, ‘machine learning’, ‘industry’, ‘technology’, 
‘innovation’, ‘bigdata’, ‘ai’, ‘data science’, etc. are some of the most used words in context to Future of Work. Thus, 
it can be inferred that as per the perception of people, businesses or organizations, Future of Work will not only be 
greatly impacted by the emerging technologies but also may depend upon the type of industry and the scope of 
innovation within a specific industry.  
4.1.2 Re-tweet Analysis  
Retweet Analysis is performed to understand the retweet ratio, which is the ratio of retweets to total retweets for any 
given time frame (here for the collected sample data). This retweet ratio can be used to determine the level of social 
influence with respect to the opinions and views regarding the Future of Work  
  


 
                                                                        Figure 2: Retweet Analysis

The same corpus is used to form the TDM (Term Document Matrix). Here, 15 topics with 15 words each are 


identified using the LDA Algorithm and Correlated Topic Model (CTM). The ‘topic-models’ library is used for this 
purpose.  


3.6 ANOVA to understand Technology Enablers for Future of Work  
On analyzing the different topics and their corresponding themes from the extracted tweets using Topic Modelling, 


the different technologies that may act as or are perceived to act as the enablers of Future of Work are identified. 
ANOVA is a statistical technique that is used to determine whether the means of two or more samples or groups are 
significantly different from each other. It is used to check the impact of one or more variables or factors by simply 
comparing the means of the samples or groups. The F-statistic or F-ratio measures whether the means of different 
groups are similar or not. Lower the value of F-ratio, more similar are the means of the groups and vice versa.  


For checking which of the groups or samples have different means, the Bonferroni approach is used and t-test (Two 
sample assuming equal variances) for every pair of sample or group is performed. This will help in determining which 
of the samples or groups belong to the same population.   


 
4. Results & Discussion   


Knowledge extraction from twitter data is performed by steps mentioned below:

4.1 Descriptive Analysis  


4.1.1 Word-Cloud  
 Exploratory data analysis is performed by constructing a word-cloud with the sample data of approximately 1.11 


lakh tweets. We created the word-cloud of maximum 250 words with a minimum frequency of 100 ranging across all 
the tweets. The words with the highest frequency have the maximum font size while those with low frequencies have 
a decreased font size.  


  
Figure 1: Future of Work - Word Cloud of all tweets  


  
From the word-cloud, it is very much evident that the words ‘robot’, ‘machine learning’, ‘industry’, ‘technology’, 
‘innovation’, ‘bigdata’, ‘ai’, ‘data science’, etc. are some of the most used words in context to Future of Work. Thus, 
it can be inferred that as per the perception of people, businesses or organizations, Future of Work will not only be 
greatly impacted by the emerging technologies but also may depend upon the type of industry and the scope of 
innovation within a specific industry.  
4.1.2 Re-tweet Analysis  
Retweet Analysis is performed to understand the retweet ratio, which is the ratio of retweets to total retweets for any 
given time frame (here for the collected sample data). This retweet ratio can be used to determine the level of social 
influence with respect to the opinions and views regarding the Future of Work  
  


 
                                                                        Figure 2: Retweet Analysis

  Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000–000   5  
From the graph, it can be understood that most of the tweets at any point of time were retweets. Also, the retweet ratio 
is the highest between the 12:00 to 14:00 hours of any specific day. On analyzing the plot, it is seen the perception of 
people, businesses or organizations is highly influenced by the content related to Future of Work on social media 
(Twitter), to which they may agree or disagree. The Retweet Analysis coupled with Sentiment Analysis gives a fair 
picture of the level of social influence along with the expressed sentiments  


4.2 Sentiment Analysis  


         Sentiment Analysis is used to identify and categorize opinions into positive, negative or neutral. The sentiment 
score for each tweet is calculated and then aggregated them into positive, negative and neutral categories. Any tweet 
with a sentiment score > 0 is positive, sentiment score < 0 is negative and sentiment score = 0 is neutral.   
  


 
  
        Figure 3: Sentiment Score Bar Plot  


  
Thus, majority of the collected tweets were neutral, followed by positive and then negative. From the neutral 


behavior of the tweets, we can infer that maximum of the tweets may have mixed perceptions about Future of Work. 
For example, Industry 4.0 in the manufacturing industry may be termed as positive for increasing efficiency but at the 
same time it may be considered negative for reducing labour. Thus, the final perception becomes neutral.   


Also, there are very few tweets that exhibit high negative sentiment scores and even comparatively lower than the 
number of high positive sentiment tweets. This indicates that the opinions are largely without any biases

6  Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2019) 000–000  
From the above graph, it is seen that out of approximately 1.11 lakh tweets, approximately 60000 tweets exhibit 


neutral sentiment, followed by approximately 40000 positive sentiments and approximately 10,000 exhibit negative 
sentiments.  


4.3 Topic Modelling  


Topic Modelling is used to capture or identify the different themes that may be exhibited in a group of text or 
documents. The LDA (Latent Dirichlet Algorithm) and CTM (Correlated Topic Model) are used to identify the 
different themes by grouping the tweets into 30 topics of 15 words each [4,7,8,10]. The list of topics thus obtained are 
as follows:  


 
Figure 5: Future of Work Topic List  


  
4.4 ANOVA to understand Technology Enablers for Future of Work   


On analyzing the different topics and their corresponding themes from the extracted tweets using Topic Modelling, 
different technologies that may act as or are perceived to act as the enablers of Future of Work are identified. The 
different technologies are: “Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science, Big Data, 
Digitalization, Automation”. All these enablers are rated using the 30 topics and further statistically analyzed them 
using ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) and t-tests.  The result of the One-Way ANOVA analysis can be shown as 
follows:

Here, the value of F-statistic (6.823529) is greater than the F-critical value for the selected level of significance 


(α=0.05). Also, the p-value is much less than α. Thus, it can be said that at least one of the groups has a different mean 
and belongs to a different population.  


Using the Bonferroni approach, it is tried to find out which of the groups represent different populations. T-tests 
are performed for every pair of groups and compare their corresponding p-values.

From the individual t-tests performed for every pair of technology groups, it is seen that the technologies such as 
Big Data, Data Science, Automation, Machine Learning and Digitalization belong to the same population. On the 
other hand, technologies such as AI and Robotics belong to an entirely different population. Thus, it can be said that 
AI and Robotics are perceived to have a significant effect on the Future of Work.   


5. Conclusion  


The study attempted to understand the factors that are mostly discussed and are of critical concern among stakeholders 
surrounding FoW. In this context, social media analytics has been applied on user generated content to highlight the 
following findings across 1.1 lakh tweets. 


 The study supports the notion that the social media discussions can strongly influence the opinions and 
perceptions of people, businesses or organizations regarding Future of Work.  


 The results of sentiment analysis exhibit that there is not much negative sentiment regarding the change in 
nature of work.  


 The neutrality of majority of the tweets indicates that the emerging technologies are perceived to have both 
positive as well as negative impact which may balance out each other in future. However, high positive 
sentiments otherwise indicate that there is an optimistic approach towards the changing nature of work due 
to the emerging technologies. The high number of retweets means that the discussions are highly influenced 
by the opinions and perceptions of major influencers.   


 The themes identified from topic modelling identified Artificial Intelligence and Robotics as the main 
technology enablers. However, many literature studies state the type of industry also plays a major role and 
is a key facilitator in driving this change.  


This exploration paves the path for a much deeper understanding from different stakeholders surrounding drivers and 
factors which may affect the FoW in the future.
