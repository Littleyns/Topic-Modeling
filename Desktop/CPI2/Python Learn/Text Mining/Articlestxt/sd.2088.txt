Abstract


Technology has indispensably been a part of the city evolution throughout history. In


recent years, there has been a shift in the pattern of development in smart cities,


where smart cities attempt to embrace practices of sustainability using Information


and Communication Technologies and other smart solutions. Past studies reveal that


these smart cities have failed in successfully incorporating sustainable development


goals into their smart strategies, where they tend to focus more on achieving smart-


ness goals rather than sustainability goals and targets. This paper presents a multi-


faceted interrogative study on several ongoing smart city initiatives around the globe


that supports United Nations Urban Sustainability Agenda. This paper aims to focus


on harmonizing smart and sustainable city initiatives with the United Nations Sus-


tainable Development Goals using a systems thinking approach. The study develops


conceptual models that support the city transition into being a sustainable smart city.


These conceptual models were designed based on the fundamentals of system think-


ing for a system of several elements under the key catalyzers “Policy and


Governance,” “Research & Development,” and “Partnership.” The causalities and


interrelationships among elements in developed conceptual models justify the


dynamicity and the impact of these elements within a system. The outcome of this


research paper would support industry experts, policymakers, and city planners to


adopt robust policy interventions and best practices for developing strategies that


support the transition of smart cities to the futuristic label of sustainable cities.

1 | INTRODUCTION


1.1 | Background


Modern societies face tremendous sustainability challenges ranging


from environmental (climate change, air quality issues, waste


accumulation), economic (unemployment, economic inequality) to


social (food security, water scarcity, and poverty) challenges (Zander


& Mosterman, 2017). Addressing sustainability challenges is of para-


mount importance. In the modern era of escalated progress where cit-


ies push their boundaries to transform into smart and sustainable


urban spaces, the concept of sustainable urban development (SUD) is

seen only as a preview of what it eventually can do to cities in achiev-


ing selective development goals. It is often foreseen as a future devel-


opment concept, but in reality, when visualized through the lenses of


the tri-dimensional sustainable notion, it is a multigenerational solidar-


ity concept that requires immediate attention. The concept of sustain-


ability has gained momentum due to the prime concern of cities on


the socio-economic wellbeing of the citizens worldwide rather than


just the infrastructure development (Mori & Christodoulou, 2012).


With the emerging sustainability threats on cities, it is essential to


upgrade even the highly sophisticated support systems, deployed


technologies, and existing infrastructures (Hamman, Anquetin, &


Monicolle, 2017). This calls for the replacement of the existing infra-


structures and city services, where such changes are felt necessary.


Smart city strategies and initiatives with an eye for SUD needs to be


promoted to combat these challenges (Martosa, Pacheco-Torresa,


Ordóñeza, & Jadraque-Gagoa, 2016). The SUD perspective needs to


consider factors such as economic development, ecological conserva-


tion, and democratic equity. The 17 sustainable development goals


(SDGs) launched in September 2015 by the United Nation (UN) are


widely applied to harmonize the prime factors for urban development


(United Nations Development Program, 2015). They focus more on


long term benefits and covers several dimensions of smart and sus-


tainable cities while addressing a broad picture of several prevalent


challenges around the globe.


Smart city initiatives back the Information and Communication


Technologies (ICT) based innovations and tech-driven opportunities


to ensure a sustainable future for cities (Rodrigues & Franco, 2019).


However, although cities have diversified their objectives in achieving


these SDGs, it is highly unclear how the undertaken smart city initia-


tives by different countries contribute to achieving SDGs in the long


run. Despite its rising popularity in the streams of academia, the smart


city planning has been widely criticized for not successfully incorpo-


rating the goals of SUD into practice (Bibri, 2018; Angelidou


et al., 2018; Bibri & Krogstie, 2017; Bifulco, Tregua, Amitrano, &


D'Auria, 2016; Höjer & Wangel, 2014; Hollands, 2008). Hence, a sys-


tematic decision support system is felt necessary at the strategic level


(Pichler, 2017), that would harmonize smart and sustainable city initia-


tives with the desired 2030 UN SDGs. Since, besides linking each ini-


tiative with the SDGs, predicting the system changes under


uncertainties is crucial and a demanding task. Here lies the rationale


of our research. This opens the door to integrated systems thinking


approach. System dynamic and system thinking approaches are thus


often regarded as the most appropriate method in troubleshooting


problems (Sterman, 2000).


The research intends to investigate several ongoing smart city


initiatives around the globe to identify possible existing knowledge


gaps. Thus, the systems-thinking approach acts as catalysts in inte-


grating all the dimensions of the smart city, covering all the themes


and sub-themes addressed under each smart city initiative. This


study acts as a backbone for future alterations to existing smart city


initiatives to improve their strategies or for current smart city initia-


tives to expand their scope in connecting cities and communities.


The new approach aids not only smart cities to connect with the UN


SDGs but also to connect with all other sustainable development


plans and strategies.


1.2 | Research objectives and organization of the
research


This paper presents a novel multi integrated systems-thinking


approach for harmonizing smart and sustainable city initiatives with


the UN SDGs. The new integrated systems thinking approach would


provide the business owners with a systematic framework for


assessing smart city initiatives, strategic planning, cost-based analysis


(CBA), and stakeholder engagement. The key objectives of this study


can be summarized in the following points:


1 Investigate the extent to which several smart city initiatives around


the globe interweave the sustainability and SUD themes in their


proposed strategies. This helps in identifying the existing gaps and


providing possible recommendations to build a more resilient


community.


2 Harmonize smart city initiatives with UN SDGs using a system-


thinking approach, to emphasize systems thinking as the most effi-


cient tool in providing a possible feedback mechanism to unwind


several challenges that arise in the urban ecosystem.


3 Analyze key catalyzers that stay as supporting plugins for bridging


the existing gap and interlinking smart city initiatives with other


possible SDGs to maximize future development and minimize city


challenges.


The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents


the methods used in conducting the systematic review, mapping pro-


cess, and system thinking approach. The third section brings out an


in-depth review of smart city initiatives and systems thinking


approach. The relevance of why system thinking is required for smart


cities to transform into a smart sustainable city is highlighted. Sec-


tion 4 deals with the classification of smart city initiatives based on


several key drivers of the smart city. This section also undergoes a


mapping process where each selected smart city initiative is mapped


to corresponding SDGs. Section 5 elucidates the proposed systems


thinking approach. The next section presents a discussion along with


the final Section 7 presenting possible recommendations for future


research with concluding remarks.

targeted scholarly articles, conference proceedings, published books,


book sections, and web-based sources, including industry reports and


grey literature.


However, the primary focus of this search is to investigate


research developments in the context of smart cities, including smart


city initiatives, complex systems, and dynamic interactions within the


smart cities. The search covered the period between 1997 and 2019,


considering that the concept of SUD has gained popularity during the


late 1990s (Bibri & Krogstie, 2017). More attention has been given to


the period from 2016 to 2019 as this period witnessed the announce-


ment of the 17 SDGs of the Sustainable Development agenda 2030


by the United Nations. A total of abstracts of 262 articles were inves-


tigated and then reduced to 147 articles. After completely reading


these articles, the number of articles reduced to 86 articles exploring


smart cities from a non-fragmented point of view and tools for study-


ing system behaviors.


Each of the smart city initiatives was mapped to corresponding


SDGs to investigate the extent to which smart city initiatives inter-


weave the sustainability and SUD themes. A total of 118 smart city


case studies and success stories were reviewed and then reduced to


50 case studies that are more relevant for the mapping process. These


case studies were collected from official websites or government


online e-resources. Moreover, the smart city initiatives are then indi-


vidually reviewed to specify the degree of alignment with the SDGs.


The degree of alignment with SDGs was gauged by conducting an


Assessment of Progress (AOP) for each smart city initiatives using 232


indicators. At least four indicators were selected under each goal. The


selection was more focused on indicators relevant to the policy out-


put. The reference Table 1 highlights the selected set of indicators


corresponding to each target.


The new systems-thinking approach uses the causal feedback


loop diagram (CLD) method to visualize systems behavior and dynam-


ics. A rich picture was initially used to understand the complex situa-


tion. An iterative process was conducted to re-work on the existing


perceptions of each group member, who siloed while creating the rich


picture was undertaken. The individual mental modals were then


grouped to form a good rich picture with a better understanding of


the scenario. Once the rich picture was developed and the major ele-


ments in the system identified, an interrelationship digraph (IRD) was


constructed. A paper and pen were used to create the IRD. The IRD


approach provides a better understanding of the key drivers in the


system and helps in identifying the feedback loops. The causalities


between each element in the system were backed by expert judg-


ments, literature reviews, and the author's conceptualization. These


diagrams were constructed with elaborate behaviors and realistic


hypotheses. Finally, the IRD was converted to a CLD through an itera-


tive process. This study used the “Vensim PLE 7.3.5” for CLD develop-


ment. Finally, the findings were presented in the written format.

3 | LITERATURE REVIEW


3.1 | Smart city initiatives


The phrase “smart city” has transpired to address several challenges


and possibilities in urban planning and city development for a vast


majority of the population across several disciplines. The concept has


also gained immense popularity all over the research community


(Camero & Alba, 2019). In simple terms, cities that strive to make it


“smarter” is termed as smart cities (Chourabi et al., 2012). Smart city ini-


tiatives are transformational initiatives aimed at reforming the city ser-


vices to deliver a better quality of life to the citizens (Odendaal, 2003).


As of 2018, estimates show that there are around 473 smart city pro-


jects (both inclusive of on-going and completed projects) in 57 coun-


tries around the globe (Smart City Expo World Congress, 2018). In


particular, countries like South Korea and Singapore have invested mas-


sive shares of spending on IoT based solutions to digitalize and sustain-


ably transform the nation into an intelligent nation. Cities such as


Masdar, Brisbane, and San Fransisco have invested a great deal in the


digital transformation of their cities to step foot into the future goal of


the smart planet (Yigitcanlar, Han, Kamruzzaman, Ioppolo, & Sabatini-


Marques, 2019; Yigitcanlar, Kamruzzaman, Foth, et al., 2019). These


smart city initiatives aim at implementing smart technologies to address


the prevailing challenges in urban areas such as inaccessibility to safe


and clean drinking water, lack of proper public health services, lack of


employment opportunities, and social prosperity (Yigitcanlar et al., 2018).


They also attempt to address challenges such as poverty, traffic conges-


tion, global climatic changes, inadequate sustainable infrastructure,


community living.


The primary objective of these initiatives is to transform cities


into being smarter, greener, and sustainable, which means a better

quality of life to the citizens and increased economic opportunities.


The smart city initiatives use a wide range of ICT based intelligent


services (Rodrigues & Franco, 2019), starting from capturing and dis-


seminating information across the city through data centers.


According to Lava Active inflow report, several government agencies


are partnering with private firms to optimize city services and


develop more sustainable and intelligent solutions by adopting open


data and geospatial intelligence. The anti-poverty initiative, “The


Poverty in NYC” partnered with the Poverty Research Team, is an


excellent example of using open data sources to tackle the social


inequality problems (Murray, 2018). These deep-lobed partnerships


support decision making to address the concerns of citizens. For


instance, the innovative funding mechanism pictured by the munici-


pal government in Rio De Janeiro has been initiated to tackle the


funding issues to support urban development and city transforma-


tion. Statistics show that around 35% of the investments for


supporting the city development activities are managed through pri-


vate investors. The Rio municipality has leveraged the bureaucratic


restrictions imposed on private investments by certain policy


reforms to encourage Public-Private Partnerships (PPP) (Smart City


Hub, 2017). The Rio city administrations have extended the concept


of PPP to invite not only foreign investments but also several service


providers and asset builders who had partnered with the govern-


ment to work on their behalf. An example of PPP arrangements can


be seen in the case of the General Outpatient Clinic PPP Programme


launched in Hong Kong, 2014. In this program, all the general outpa-


tient services are outsourced to private healthcare service providers


who substitute the Hong Kong Hospital Authority (HA) in providing


these services to the city residents (Onag, 2018). This initiative


ensures proper health and sanitation benefits to all its citizens. Here


the government acts as an enabler, policy reformer, and procurer of


city services, thus stimulating economic growth.


As these examples suggest, smart city initiatives help in mitigating


several urban development challenges. These challenges are over-


come by utilizing data and services from intelligent technologies, like


location intelligence, Geospatial technology, Internet of Things, Big


data, and Cloud systems. This caters to the needs of the city residents,


improves city stakeholder involvement, and provides a better under-


standing of the city operations. Although the concept of SUD in smart


cities seems very practical and viable, in reality, however, it is very


complex, demanding, and context determined (Yigitcanlar &


Kamruzzaman, 2018). Assessing environmental sustainability perfor-


mance remains a great challenge (Egilmez, Gumus, & Kucukvar, 2015).


Challenges such as the inability of matching the urban sustainability


demands to the real-time applicability context, lack of proper align-


ment in policy and technology implementation, and coercion on social


and regional solidarity that demand diverse governance solutions, also


deteriorate sustainable city performance.


3.2 | Smart cities and systems thinking


To tackle these challenges, cities have started adopting smart initia-


tives (Marsal-Llacuna, Colomer-Llinàs, & Meléndez-Frigola, 2015).


These smart city initiatives are often assumed to be a successful


approach in curbing possible city challenges. Table 2 highlights several


peer-reviewed research articles published in the field of smart cities


and systems thinking during the past decade. These researches


emphasize the abundance of the research works in the field of harmo-


nizing smart city initiatives with SDGs using a system-thinking


approach.


Systems thinking provides a broader understanding of how a


system functions by investigating the relations and changes within


the system. The smart city challenges are often perceived as a


product of structured relations between selective parameters


addressing these challenges, rather than just identifying causes and


behavioral changes separately like the traditional linear thinking.


These parameters are considered as a part of the city holistically, or


pillars that address the challenges of the city, where the smart city


is seen as an integration of systems (Dirks & Keeling, 2009). Any


alteration to these parameters will affect the system as a whole.


Therefore, the flaws that affect the overall dynamics of the city can


be overcome by bringing systems thinking into the context of smart


cities.


Systems theory has recently been used to formalize smart city


visions by playing a vital role in strategic city planning. Several other


tools, along with systems thinking, are used to tackle the smart city


challenges in urban planning, for instance, Kitemark recognition,


F IGURE 1 Proposed methodology


1352 KUTTY ET AL.






Bench-learning, Progress monitoring. (Pichler, 2017). System theory


outweighs all other tools, because of its systematic behavior in inte-


grating systems, the ability to predict composite changes within the


system, and understanding the relevance of possible divergence.


Systems thinking addressed in the smart cities context considers


socioeconomic and environmental characteristics and their dependen-


cies with several systems and subsystems (Shmelev &


Shmeleva, 2018). This feature paves ways to SUD in smart cities (Pre-


torius, Pretorius, & Benade, 2014).


Systems thinking as a tool can also help cities in framing a better


idea on several input–output parameters, for example, population,


urban space, air, water, waste, energy, safety, and transportation.


System thining helps in a better understanding of how these parame-


ters hold influence in the governance stage.


3.2.1 | Why systems thinking and how it works


Cities are often considered as complex systems (Berkowitz, Nilon, &


Hollweg, 2003; Mora, Bolici, & Deakin, 2017; Portugali, 2016). These


systems constitute several subsystems that are interconnected and


interrelated with each other to perform specific functions


(Bertalanffy, 1976). Functions are often related, and they tie-in con-


necting several elements within the system. Considering an example

08. Living labs, innovation districts, and information
marketplaces: A systems approach for smart
cities


This study attempts to develop a candidate model
for implementing the smart city concept into
practice by incorporating systems thinking and
integrating the living lab and innovation district
concept.

of the road as a function, we can see that the road functions to move


vehicular traffic acting as a mediator for the movement- connecting


people and vehicles from the source to destination. Thus, understand-


ing these functions helps us in associating various elements and pro-


cesses that are essential in filling these functions and facilitates us


with a broader understanding of the results obtained when these


functions are filled. Thus, applying systems thinking to understand


these functions act as a potential leverage point since, systems think-


ing identifies necessities (Onat, Kucukvar, Halog, & Cloutier, 2017),


possible knowledge gaps, correlations, and goals. Additionally, it helps


in locating possible system paralysis, absent elements, inefficiencies in


urban dynamics, and possible links that form a part of the function's


work cycle.


Cities, when visualized as an urban ecological system, contain


several subsystems (e.g., but are not limited to population, urban


space, air, water, energy, food, waste, safety, health, and transporta-


tion) that act as a system itself in the network of systems. A slight dis-


ruption in the functioning of either of these subsystems would result


in undesirable consequences in other subsystems within the network


of systems, thus affecting the overall dynamics and efficiency of the


system. “Systems thinking” is thus an answer to all these questions


and challenges, where systems thinking acts as a support tool in


addressing complexities, uncertainties, and identifying “what if”


impacts (Onat et al., 2017). Systems thinking interconnects several


elements of a system to the point of interest, better identified as a


purpose. For example, let us say that the traffic and transportation


modelers in a city wish to redesign the transportation system that has


been existing as an integral part of the city infrastructure for the past


50 years. The conventional planning model of the city's transportation


network would hold “transportation” as its prime focus. However, in a


smart city, the modelers would extend their point of interest on fac-


tors such as smart mobility, zero-emission transportation alternatives,


and increased connectivity for the city residents. Systems thinking


provides a broader understanding of how a system functions by inves-


tigating the relations and changes within the system. When under-


standing the concept of systems thinking vis-à-vis smart cities, city


challenges are perceived as a product of structured relations between


selective parameters that address the challenges, rather than just


identifying causes and behavioral changes separately like the tradi-


tional linear thinking. These parameters are considered as a part of


the city holistically, or pillars that address the challenges of the city,


where the smart city is seen as an integration of systems (Dirks &


Keeling, 2009). Any alteration to these parameters will affect the sys-


tem as a whole. Thus, bringing systems thinking into the context of


smart cities, we can troubleshoot flaws that affect the overall dynam-


ics of the city with marginal effort.


3.3 | Novelty statement and research gap


The comprehensive review revealed that only a handful of articles


attempted to arrange and describe possible interactions between the


key drivers/elements of the smart city at a strategic level. Little to no


articles dealt with the complex system changes under several “what


if” conditions from a global perspective. Most cases were region-spe-


cific which set boundaries that focused on interactions in a system to


achieve smartness goals rather than the sustainability goals and tar-


gets. Also, the literature review saw the lack of a considerable


amount of tools to understand the dynamic behavior of elements


under system interaction. Although several implementation tools


such as the Kitemark recognition and progress monitoring tools exist


in the literature, neither of them attempts to consider the interdepen-


dencies between the socio-economic, environmental, and numerous


subsystems that form the basis of any sustainable urban planning


model. Despite prevalent methods used, cities also face a tremen-


dous deal of criticism, challenges, and difficulties when it comes to


the deployment and implementation of SDGs into the pre-conceptu-


alized vision of smart sustainable city (Bibri & Krogstie, 2017).


Accounting to the research gaps identified, this paper attempts to fill


these gaps by:


1 Conducting a mapping process between the selected smart city ini-


tiatives around the globe with the UN SDGs based on a selected


set of indicators and targets. This mapping intends to deliver good


practices and guidelines for several initiatives to adopt a transition


from the sustainable city or from smart city to smart sustainable


city strategies while concurrently achieving the SDGs. These initia-


tives can further be redefined to align with other SDGs according


to any sort of future challenges that may arise in that city, thus


facilitating a smart sustainable city transformation.


2 Considering the complex interactions between several elements in


smart cities through a systems thinking approach. The research


attempts to consider smart cities as complex urban ecological sys-


tems (Berkowitz et al., 2003) that provide optimal solutions for the


existing problems by analyzing the traits of these systems. Here, a


strong realization and understanding of the system fundamentals


are taken into account in context to the urban environment. Sev-


eral conceptual models to better understand the dynamics of the


key catalyzers that promote better harmonization of smart city ini-


tiatives with SDGs were developed. This participatory approach


helps in identifying possible knowledge gaps and barriers and also


helps in creating more opportunities for the development of a


smart city. These participatory approaches are often considered as


the building characteristics of the city's smart strategies


(Angelidou, 2017).


3 Shedding lights on Systems thinking as a tool that evaluates com-


plex feedback behaviors considering non-linear and endogenous


characteristics in system interaction. Systems thinking as a tool


presented in this study facilitates impeccable legitimacy of judg-


ments for intercession and a collaborative approach to support


decision making in smart cities. These aim at providing the best


possible solutions for discursive judgment making. The system


thinking tool in this paper considers all the interdependencies


among various subsystems and all the dimensions of sustainability


that support framing urban sustainability policies and bettering


planning models for SUD.

4 | CLASSIFICATION AND MAPPING OF
SMART CITY INITIATIVES


In order to add a high value to our research and achieve the research


objective, we have selected some smart city initiatives around the


globe that aim to catapult several smart city services in achieving the


smart, sustainable city paradigm. These initiatives were selected based


on their high potential to contribute significantly to the United


Nations Urban Sustainability Agenda. Although several smart solu-


tions implemented by cities contribute to the smart development


prospect, these solutions do not constitute itself for smart city imple-


mentation as a whole. Hence, these smart solutions do not qualify as


smart city initiatives to be included in our selection criteria. How well


these selected initiatives contribute to achieving appropriate UN


SDGs still remains a question and needs further investigation.


Attempting to understand how well certain aspects of SUD and


smart cities have been incorporated in several smart city initiatives,


each initiative has been categorized based on certain drivers or critical


factors they address like sustainability, policy context, people and


communities, SUD, and so forth (Table 3). This attempt measures the


coverage of several drivers of the smart, sustainable city that has been


addressed under the mentioned smart city initiatives. Similarly, to


identify how well several smart city initiatives undertaken by different


countries around the globe utilize ICTs to achieve the UN SDGs, the


research maps different smart city initiatives with the 17 UN SDGs


(Table 4).


5 | PROPOSED SYSTEMS THINKING
APPROACH


Systems theory has recently been used to formalize smart city visions


by playing a vital role in strategic city planning. Several other tools,


along with systems thinking, are used to tackle the prevailing chal-


lenges in urban planning like Kitemark recognition, Bench-learning,


Progress monitoring, and so forth (Pichler, 2017). System theory out-


weighs all other tools, because of its systematic behavior in integrat-


ing systems, the ability to predict composite changes within the


system, and understanding the relevance of feasible divergence. Sys-


tems thinking addressed in context with smart cities considers socio-


economic and environmental characteristics and their dependencies


with several systems and subsystems in a model that helps in strategic


city planning (Shmelev & Shmeleva, 2018). This paves ways to SUD in


smart cities (Pretorius et al., 2014).


Several smart city initiatives have been mapped with the


corresponding UN SDGs. This mapping strategy facilitates city plan-


ners, urban stakeholders, and policymakers to frame an outline of


the diverse concepts, actions, policies, and models adopted by sev-


eral countries. This would aid them in attenuating negative external-


ities and help them in redefining their policies and governance


patterns. However, productive outcomes can result only through


the deployment of new and innovative products, policy and gover-


nance, Research & Development (R&D), and partnerships between


service providers, external private investors, and foreign technology


drivers.


Proper policy and governance structure can play a very crucial


role in molding the outcomes of ICT driven smart city development


towards achieving SUD and achieving SDG 11, SDG 9, SDG 17, and


other SDGs. A complex multi-level governance framework that sup-


ports sustainable transformation is often necessary. Such governance


frameworks are often backed with concrete policies that are transpar-


ent and inclusive, include critical system thinkers, and intimate con-


sumers. A landscape that propels the transition of initiatives into


broader sustainability directions to achieve sustainability goals is


essential. Such transitions are possible when the flaws and challenges


prevailing in the economy are identified and answered. R&D objec-


tives play a vital role in the identification of these challenges, new


opportunities, and implementation of ICT processes. For instance,


R&D identifies the critical issue prevalent in the city; for example,


water quality (SDG 3: Good Health & Well-being). Scientific research


shows that a decline in water quality adversely affects the climate,


thus posing a critical challenge for SUD (SDG 13: Combating Climate


change). The R&D scientists investigate and formulate a well-struc-


tured dataset with a high degree of information that is essential for


developing a smart city platform aimed at mitigating the water quality


issues in an attempt to deliver clean and safe drinking water to the


city residents (SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation). They also develop


frameworks to monitor the contamination and waste accumulation in


the water and formulate methods to recycle and reuse it (SDG 12:


Sustainable consumption and production). Properly funded research


initiatives thus form the backbone in implementing sustainable results,


when backed with proper policy reforms that support research initia-


tives. The adequate funding mechanism, as discussed in the case of


Rio De Janeiro through Public-Private co-funding, is essential for the


successful implementation of any initiative. These partnerships bring


competitive advantage for sustainable growth in cities. Similarly, a sig-


nificant contribution from the political sphere for development assis-


tance is felt necessary (SDG: 17 Partnership for the Goals). When


such socio-economic and environmental aspects are addressed with


ICT driven smart technologies, it results in a more safe, inclusive, resil-


ient, and sustainable strand of urbanization (SDG 11: Sustainable Cit-


ies and Communities).


Thus, we can see that “policy and governance,” “research & devel-


opment” and “partnership” act as enablers, integrators, and connectors


in harmonizing and linking smart city initiatives not only with SDG 11


(Sustainable Cities and Communities) but also with other possible


SDGs and smart city targets. Hence, these three connectors are ter-


med as “catalyzers” that aid in the harmonization process of smart city


initiatives and strategies with SDGs.


5.1 | Systems thinking for Policy and Governance


Challenges associated with cities and sustainable urbanization are


extremely difficult to address by single entities, thus requires strong


collaboration among stakeholders, adaptive management strategies,


KUTTY ET AL. 1355






and, well-structured and agile governance models. A well-structured


governance framework aims to improve the quality of urban pol-


icymaking and implementation strategies (Blanc, 2015). A well-


structured policy & governance system is based on several important


variables including participation in governance and decision-making,


involvement in political activities, and community-based

interrelatedness. Additional variables such as citizen engagement,


quality of urban policymaking, city challenges, and SDGs also support


this system.


Visvizi and Lytras (2018) highlight the importance of proper policy


measures in transforming cities to be smarter and more sustainable. Fig-


ure 2 shows a causal feedback loop diagram to explain the catalyzer role


of policy & governance for the successful implementation of SDGs. All


the variables depicted in the CLD are based on available smart city liter-


ature and they are harmonized and conceptualized in a way that too


explains the main mechanism systematically and holistically. In Figure 2,


two main loops, one balancing (B1) and one reinforcing (R1) are identi-


fied to explain two sides of the mechanism. B1 is a balancing feedback


loop explaining the relationship between urban population and city chal-


lenges, where the need for a proper policy framework is directly depen-


dent on the influence of the city challenges. This is attained through


effective participation in the governance and decision-making process.


An increase in the urban population can bring about a series of socio-


economic and environmental challenges in the city (Jarah, Zhou, Abdul-


lah, Lu, & Yu, 2019). Through effective participation in the governance


system, a set of quality policies and governance strategies are achieved


(Ahrens & Meurers, 2011). This, in turn, supports UNSDGs for smart cit-


ies, thus reducing smart city challenges when SDGs are implemented. In


some way, collective actions and participation can create a self-cor-


recting or self-organizing structure for sustainable urban policy develop-


ment and implementation.


Similarly, participation in governance and decision making will


have a positive influence on the involvement of the city residents in


political activities (Alghais, Pullar, & Charles-Edwards, 2018). This


increases the community-based interrelatedness. This, in turn, facili-


tates opportunities for male and female representatives to engage in


the policy & governance system, thus reinforcing the participation in


governance & decision making via reinforcing loop R1; see Figure 2.


Thus, we can see that all the causal relations interlink and balance


the policy & governance structure, strengthening the system by


reducing city challenges and harmonizing SUD goals with the ele-


ments of the system. Thus, facilitating the transformation of a smart


city into a smart sustainable city.


5.2 | Connecting systems thinking approach with
research & development (R&D)


There are several potential leverage points or soft factors (Figure 3)


that are influenced by the management discretion on the R&D activi-


ties like the influence of market demand, idea, resource allocation


(staffing and time allotted per designated staff for the research activi-


ties) and R&D intensity. These leverage points can be attributed to


decision support factors that drive R&D activities.


An empirical study conducted by Dalziel, Gentry, and


Bowerman (2010) on R&D capital reveals a positive correlation between


R&D capital and R&D spending. Poyago-Theotoky, Beath, and


Siegel (2002) reveals the merits of partnership in stimulating technologi-


cal and revenue related growth opportunities in universities andT

fundamental research institutions. Technology utilization and potential


R&D investments endure possible benefits and are considered as a


source of revenue (Ayming, 2017). While observing the loop R3, we can


see that a positive influence on the R&D intensity (revenue generated


and spent on R&D related activities) along with positive market influ-


ence and partnership yields a positive response on the revenue factor.


This, in turn, leads to a positive influence on the R&D capital assigned


for conducting R&D activities, resulting in a positive response on the


ICT based technologies that itself act as a source for additional revenue.


This positively influences the R&D capital and the R&D activities, conse-


quently reinforcing the loop through the loop R3.


Data infrastructures are perceived as backbones for stimulating


substantial value for public and private ventures, enterprises, and citi-


zens alike (Ahdoot, 2019). Real-time data offers a fundamental change


to the existing infrastructures by offering the potential for integrating


services through networked structures (Hashem et al., 2016). The loop


B2 emphasizes the dynamic relation of the need for smart solutions


that have occurred as a result of the positive response of city chal-


lenges due to the population (R2). This positively influences the real-


time data available, thus influencing positively the number of data


centers for capturing and disseminating real-time data to support the


ICT based technological innovation, which in turn will cause a positive


response (either decrease or increase) in the smart solutions. A posi-


tive response in the smart solution will have a negative influence on


the need for smart solutions, that is, an increase in the smart solutions


will lead to a decrease in the need for smart solutions and vice versa,


thus balancing the loop through balance loop B2.


Loop B3 emphasizes the relationship of city challenges and SDGs,


where city challenges positively influence the need for smart


solutions. This positively influences the real-time data available, which


influences positively the number of data centers available for captur-


ing and disseminating real-time data to support the ICT based techno-


logical innovation, which in turn causes a positive response (either


decrease or increase) in the smart solutions. Smart solutions tend to


address social, economic, political, and environmental sustainability


challenges and support the SUD and harmonization of smart initia-


tives with SDGs. Thus, an increase in smart solutions would facilitate


addressing the sustainability challenges and integrating smart initia-


tives with SDGs in a better manner. This reduces city challenges or


vice versa as the case may be, thus balancing the feedback loop


through balance loop B3.


Loop R4 emphasizes the dynamic relationship of R&D activities


on SDGs. ICT based technologies act as enablers when attempting to


remodel a sustainable city with smart solutions into a smart sustain-


able city (Prakash, 2017). Here, ICT based technological stock exerts a


positive response on the smart solutions, which in turn tend to sup-


port the harmonization of smart initiatives with SDGs in a positive


influence manner. This facilitates optimal resources to support R&D


activities, thus consequently reinforcing the loop (R4), and the loop


continues.


5.3 | Connecting systems thinking approach with
partnership


The catalyzer role of “partnership” is presented by the CLD through


the loops B4 and B5 (see Figure 4). These relationships are based on


the existing smart city literature and conceptualization of these


F IGURE 2 Causal loop representation for the catalyzer Policy & Governance

KUTTY ET AL. 1359






separately studied relationships in a single CLD. The dynamics of the


loop B4 explain a positive response to the urban population that leads


to an outbreak of several city challenges, hindering economic growth.


In some way, this loop explains the limits of economic growth given


the growth capacity of the city. Increased economic growth facilitates


better job opportunities and availabilities in the current market (Donor


Committee for Enterprise Development [DCED], 2019). This facili-


tates an appealing urban space that brings more job seekers into that


urban space, thus increasing the urban population or vice versa (keep-


ing the response of the loop as positive). However, the increased pop-


ulation would increase the city challenges and hinder economic


growth to some degree. Hence, cities look for potential improvement


areas to support population growth.


The loop B5 shows that a positive response to the economic


growth would positively influence the quality of life of the citizens.


The economic growth, along with other factors such as social devel-


opment, has a positive influence on the quality of life (Joshua, 2017).


This, in turn, would lead to a negative response on the PPP and thus


negatively influencing the investment factor. Smart city investments


come from PPP and other soft factors like revenue sharing agree-


ments and pay-for-performance agreements. An increase in the


investment would lead to better funding opportunities for business


establishments that result in a transformational change leading to an


increase in economic growth (Zangoueinezhad & Azar, 2014).


Similarly, a decrease in the investment would lead to poor funding


opportunities, which would reduce the urban attractiveness for busi-


ness establishments to set up their enterprises, thus decreasing eco-


nomic activity. A considerable decrease in economic activities hinders


economic growth, hence balancing the relation through the balancing


loop B5. Hence, as discussed in the case of policy & governance, we


can see that all the causal relations interlink and balance the partner-


ship structure, strengthening the system by reducing city challenges


and adopting a transformational change. This context is better under-


stood as harmonizing SUD goals with the elements of the system,


thus facilitating the transformation of a smart city into a smart sus-


tainable city. The self-correcting mechanisms (balancing loops) play an


important role to determine the boundaries of the economic growth


potential of the city and this boundary can be leveraged up by


involvement of transformational changes and innovation.


6 | DISCUSSION


This paper provides readers a glimpse of the current status of several


smart city initiatives around the globe and their contributions to


achieving the UNSDG's. Results show that although smart city strate-


gies have echoed the inclusion of sustainability goals in their smart


agenda, in practice, cities have not adopted these goals to its full

potential in addressing future city challenges in several possible


domains. The authors have adopted a system-thinking approach to


unwind several possible causal relations in real-world cases, where a


CFLD was conceptualized since, experimental methods often hold


complexities when practically applied in real-time situations.


At the first stage, the authors conducted an in-depth literature


analysis based on several scholarly works and expert opinions in the


respective field of smart cities. This helped them in categorizing


smart city initiatives based on certain drivers or themes each initia-


tive address and understand the research gap. This has provided


readers an insight on the extent to which several initiatives around


the globe address the concept of SUD in their smart city develop-


ment agenda. In the second stage, the research identified on how


several smart city initiatives around the globe utilized ICTs to


achieve the UN SDGs, whereby mapping smart city initiatives with


the 17 UNSDGs. Based on several existing smart city literature and


conceptualization by the authors, the third stage identified certain


enablers in harmonizing smart city initiatives with several UN SDGs,


where a multi-integrated system thinking approach was used. The


authors concluded that “policy and governance,” “research & devel-


opment” (R&D), and “partnership” are key catalyzers in harmonizing


smart city strategies. Later, to visualize the system behavior for each


catalyzer using the integrated systems thinking approach, the CFLDs


were used. The causalities and the dynamic interactions among ele-


ments in the developed conceptual models justify the dynamicity


and the impact of these elements within a system. The influence of


these feedback relations is very important for successful policy inter-


ventions that support future smart sustainable city development.


These catalyzers would help future development strategies in smart


cities to align with not only SDG11 (smart and sustainable cities) but


also with other potential SDGs and are predominantly applicable in


the global context.


While analyzing the possible interactions of each SDGs with the


smart city case studies, along with the positive interactions, the nega-


tive interactions were also taken into consideration. Although these


negative interactions were excluded in the mapping process, they


were considered while building the CFLD. For example, the sustain-


ability concern related to renewable energy usage (target 7.2) holds a


negative interaction with the biofuel expansion and food security. But


these negative interactions were accounted as concerns dealing with


governance aspects than biofuel production itself.


Nevertheless, the relevance of these catalyzers and their interac-


tions, in the global scale leans on to the degree to which city chal-


lenges are being approached in context to the smart targets and goals.


This highly depends on the income level of the countries as well. The


catalyzers considerably interact with most of all the SDGs, but their


interaction possibly fades as we move up the income ladder, however,


they do not fritter away. The way these interactions are held possibly


vary based on the context they address. For example, SDG 2: Zero


Hunger is mainly considered as a pressing challenge in several under-


developed countries. It is often seen among the language of develop-


ment priority in low-income countries. However, the goal of “end


hunger” also holds great significance among the high-income nations.


“Improved nutrition” does not only point to chronic undernourishment


but also poor supplement quality (micro-nutrient deficient) in the food


consumed and increased obesity levels among the people. Managing


obesity challenges is linked closely with education in more affluent


countries in a single direction (as a good knowledge helps in under-


standing nutrition habits). While the undernourishment is linked


strongly with education in lower-income nations in multi-direction (a

healthy diet can result in better school performance, and contrariwise,


education brings a healthier choice of nutrition to the house).


The mapping process and the CFLDs helped in identifying the


connectivity and complexities within the system, thus facilitating bet-


ter learning opportunities. All intend to deliver good practices and


guidelines for several initiatives to adopt a transition from a sustain-


able city or from smart city to smart sustainable city paradigm while


concurrently achieving the SDGs.


7 | CONCLUDING REMARKS


The integrated management and thematic approach to the interaction


of several elements within the complex system may vary significantly


based on several national circumstances. This may depend on the


degree of technology used to achieve the SDGs and mitigate the chal-


lenges within the regional boundary. Although the catalyzer “policy and


governance” act as an enabler in harmonizing the 2030 Agenda, the


interactions among the several elements within the system depend on


the degree to which several institutional measures are exerted. In most


cases, the prevailing sectoral institutions provide essential competen-


cies. But only a strong interaction with the counter-institutions can help


in better understanding the problem and design possible action plans.


This fact is often neglected until today in practice.


In the designed CFLD, the elements and their possible level of


interaction are limited despite the existence of a relatively greater


number of interactions. Despite this constrain, the conceptual models


help in understanding the big picture of smart city challenge mitiga-


tion through the key catalyzers. Thus, attempting to strengthen these


key catalyzers in the smart city context can help solve complex city


challenges to a great extent and foster sustainability. A more compre-


hensive mapping selecting more indicators and pointing more possible


system interactions can be done over time. This can be done by


understanding possible seasonality in data and correlations on longer


terms. The feedback relations obtained can be validated by applying


them into real-time cases of small, medium, and large-scale smart city


projects globally. This can be performed by System dynamics model-


ing of several parameters and factors that constitute the CFLD model


for smart city harmonization can be done by adopting a qualitative


methodology, where opinions from several stakeholders are taken


into consideration. Further, a computer-simulated model for the struc-


tured systems thinking causal feedback model can be developed to


identify gaps, flaws, inconsistencies, and inefficiencies in the currently


developed model.


Based on the outcomes of the study, the authors have provided a


blueprint of recommendations for cities embarking on tailoring their


landscape to achieve SDGs outlined under the United Nations Urban


Development Agenda 2015. To attain the meta goal of SUD in smart


cities by 2030, smart cities around the globe can adopt the following


guidelines, namely:


• Even though the smart city is a multi-perspective concept, human-


centric approaches are often assumed to be the keystone of city


development and comprehensive smart strategies as they support


economic development in cities. Human-centric approaches often


act as an antidote for smart growth. For this, smart cities should


act as active learning centers that support quality education and


lifelong learning opportunities that would, in turn, support the


growth of smart people. Smart people would contribute to more


economic growth and flexibility and would act as an inviting factor


for innovative industries to establish a place in the market. This, in


turn, would open a new job market. Such approaches can undo-


ubtfully connect city development with SDGs such as SDG 8, SDG


9, and SDG 4.


• A multi-level policy and governance framework that includes; civil


society, multiple stakeholders, public and private sectors, investors,


and digitally and sustainably enabled landscape is felt necessary.


Governance strategies should be transparent and should include all


the actors and common people to facilitate an unambiguous


bureaucracy, thus structuring better responsible governance for


citizens. Such governance strategies should offer incentives for


actors who engage in compacting several sustainability challenges


(social, economic, and environmental) and promoting sustainable


growth in smart cities. Such initiatives can link smart city develop-


ment with SDGs such as SDG 1, SDG 2, SDG 6, SDG 7, SDG 9,


SDG 11, SDG 13, SDG 14 and SDG 15.


• Cities must tap into creating a smart plan that includes engagement


with universities, research centers, non-profit organizations, non-


government foreign actors, and international advisory boards.


These partnerships facilitate several benefits to smart cities. One


such benefit is the maximization of limited government budget


allotted for smart city development. This is acquired through PPP.


Another benefit is the continuity of ongoing smart city projects


that may face certain challenges and oppressions due to changes in


the ruling party during the project execution phase. This is acquired


by partnering with non-profit organizations, non-government for-


eign actors, and international advisory agents. Partnerships can


also offer better expertise in the field of smart cities, which cannot


be acquired otherwise. This is made possible through educational


institutions and research centers. Such initiatives can link smart


city development with SDGs such as SDG 9, SDG 11, SDG 16, and


SDG 17.


• Smart cities are often perceived as a web 2.0 and industry 4.0 mar-


ketplace that act as competing rings for self-made goals of corpo-


rates and multinational firms. This may raise several development


challenges in specific areas of community-based development, as


selfish competitions by corporates to reap high profits from


multibillion projects often fail to address the social challenges of


the weaker sections of the community, like the availability of clean


and safe drinking water (SDG 6), sustainable consumption patterns


(SDG 12) and food security issues (SDG 2). These corporates often


tend to focus on the needs of the elite class like home automation,


smart banking, smart cars, sophisticated apps, and platforms for


commercial purposes, and so forth. As a result, a socially inclusive


and adaptive framework is necessary to curb social inequalities and


other social challenges prevailing in cities, thus aligning these


1362 KUTTY ET AL.






futuristic change strategies of smart cities with SDG 1, SDG 3,


SDG 5, SDG 6, SDG 10 and SDG 12.


• Smart city transformation is not complete if the smart projects are


not backed by committed leaders that support the smart city


development prospect. These strong leaderships need not neces-


sarily be within the local governing bodies like Mayors, District


Attorneys, or Governors but can also be the project managers,


planning directors, members of the execution community, NGO


activists, and so forth. These initiatives can connect SDGs 11, 16,


and 17 with smart city development strategies.


! For any smart city initiative to be successful, the authors have
suggested the adoption of the 4I's while implementing smart


strategies to support city transition. The elements of the “4I's


strategy implementation pyramid” developed by the authors


include:


1 Innovation: Digital innovation provides opportunities for cities to


embrace sustainability practices by tackling several social, eco-


nomic, and environmental challenges. Smart cities are platforms


that utilize technological innovation in testing several innovative


strategies and approaches. Innovation brings in reliable alterna-


tives to compact smart city-related challenges.


2 Investment: Investments are often considered as keystones in


fostering innovation in smart cities. Smart city investments are


often income-generating, and they facilitate sufficient funding


for city maintenance and another day to day operations of cities


by generating sufficient cash flow along with several economic


benefits.


3 Inclusion: Social disparities and exclusions are some of the devel-


opment challenges that cities face. A socially inclusive frame-


work supporting smart strategies is important in steering


economic growth and prosperity.


4 Improvement: Continuous improvement programs are often


important to ensure the quality and sustainability of several pro-


duction and consumption practices and services offered in cities


such as healthcare, sanitation, infrastructure, transportation,


water supply, and so forth.
