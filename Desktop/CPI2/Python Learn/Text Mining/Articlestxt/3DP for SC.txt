3D Printing (3DP) technology has been receiving increased public attention. Many companies are seeking ways
to develop new means of creating and disseminating 3DP content, in order to capture new business opportu-
nities. However, to date the true business opportunities of 3DP have not been completely uncovered. This re-
search explores the challenges posed in the development and deployment of 3DP and focuses on China, which is
still the main manufacturing hub of the world. The main purpose of this research is to uncover the obstacles that
resist mass-scale applications of 3DP. By means of empirical semi-structured interviews with 3DP companies in
China, it is found that many companies can see the benefits of 3DP, but its potential has not been delivered as
promised. One reason is due to the fact that 3DP has not been integrated well in the supply chain. The other
reason concerns potential intellectual property issues that cannot effectively prevent counterfeiting. To tackle
the above issues, several areas have been identified that could be improved further. In particular, the legal
complications concerning 3D-printed content could be overcome by a licensing platform.


1. Introduction


3D Printing (3DP) is a disruptive and innovative technology in the
digital manufacturing era (Berman, 2012; Khajavi et al., 2014; Sasson
and Johnson, 2015). 3DP is known as additive manufacturing, rapid
manufacturing or direct digital manufacturing (Khajavi et al., 2014;
Holmström et al., 2010; Sasson and Johnson, 2015; Rogers et al., 2016).
It is a revolutionary digital technology utilising an abstract digital de-
sign file that can be transformed to a physical object by using a 3D
printer.


The development of 3DP can be traced back to the 1980s (Khajavi
et al., 2014; Rogers et al., 2016), but it is now more popular mainly
because the process cost has reached an affordable level. This is parti-
cularly true for mass customisation and large-scale applications
(Gosselin et al., 2016; Rayna and Striukova, 2016). 3DP is no longer
distant from designers in the industry and is within easy reach of the
public, including home users (Rayna and Striukova, 2016). A huge
number of manufacturers, innovation companies, and even e-commerce
companies have already benefited, or will benefit, from this technology.
The expansion of the mobile communication industry and the Internet
offers great opportunity for online 3DP platforms, the customised de-
sign service industry, and the 3DP content sharing community (Rayna


et al., 2015). Moreover, the existence of 3DP technology accelerates the
development of certain industries, for instance, spare parts manu-
facturing (Khajavi et al., 2014).


Despite the merits 3DP can potentially offer, it has not yet delivered
its full capability to industry (Rogers et al., 2016). 3DP is not a tech-
nology to replace traditional manufacturing methods, at least in its
current form from an operating cost perspective (Holweg, 2015). Ar-
guably, energy consumption may pose an issue from a sustainability
point of view, which is estimated to be one hundred times higher in 3DP
processes than in traditional manufacturing processes (Yoon et al.,
2014). This assertion is subject to debate as some other studies pro-
posed the opposite (e.g., Gebler et al., 2014; Ford and Despeisse, 2016).
Furthermore, legislation always follows, and lags behind, innovation.
Copyright law is a classic example (Rideout, 2011). While a great
number of individuals and companies are enjoying the benefits that
3DP can deliver, there is another group who is struggling with, if not
suffering from, the Intellectual Property (IP) protection issues. All these
obstacles hinder the applications of 3DP in the industry. There are lots
of research studies that have investigated 3DP technology, especially in
the material science and advanced manufacturing engineering dis-
ciplines. Nevertheless, such effort would become a waste if the tech-
nology cannot be deployed successfully in the industry.

Broadly construed, there are three related gaps in research that can
be identified from the literature to be presented in Section 2. The first
one is that there is a need to understand the opportunities and chal-
lenges of using 3DP in industry. Although 3DP is a popular topic for
discussion, the application of 3DP in the industry is still very limited.
There are obvious obstacles that restrict 3DP from having an applica-
tion on a larger scale. The technology itself is mature, which indicates
that the application side could be the source of hurdles. The second
research gap is an extension of the first research gap to supply chain
management. There are many studies that advocate the use of 3DP,
which can lower operating costs, reduce the amount of inventory, im-
prove the ability of mass customisation, and provide quicker response
to demand. Nevertheless, 3DP has not been integrated into supply chain
processes. Replacement of traditional manufacturing processes alone
cannot deliver the true value of 3DP. Innovative applications are re-
quired to boost mass scale applications of 3DP in the industry. The last
research gap are IP issues, namely that the law that cannot prevent
counterfeiting in 3DP applications effectively. This could also be one
reason why 3DP has not been integrated into the supply chain yet.


The major objective of this study is to address two research ques-
tions: (1) the current application of 3DP technology in the industry and
the associated challenges; and (2) from the legal perspective, how to
protect innovative 3D-printed content in order to help improve the
penetration of the technology within industry. Question one aims to
understand why the adoption rate of 3DP technology in the industry is
still low, and to uncover the associated challenges and obstacles. The
second research question originated from the legal perspective and
reveals how 3DP content can be protected in order to facilitate in-
novative applications of 3DP. Since this is an emerging topic, an ex-
ploratory qualitative approach is employed. To address the gaps and
questions, evidence is collected using a systematic qualitative approach
via semi-structured interviews. Details will be presented in subsequent
sections.


The rest of this paper is organised as follows: Section 2 reviews
relevant literature. Section 3 summarises the research method em-
ployed in this study, whereas Section 4 discusses the findings from 28
qualitative semi-structured interviews. Finally, Section 5 concludes this
paper.


2. Literature review


2.1. Introduction to 3DP


Since 3DP is not a new concept, this section will only briefly review
the technology itself from the manufacturing and supply chain per-
spective. The technical development of 3DP is not the focus of this
paper. We mainly focus on the implementation and management of the
3DP technology in the industry.


3DP is a cost-effective solution for many applications, including
home users, or Do-It-Yourself (DIY) users (Rideout, 2011; Doherty,
2012; Gao et al., 2015; Rayna and Striukova, 2016). From a business
perspective, the technology can offer quick customised solutions, and
create a great opportunity for made-to-order production (Gao et al.,
2015). Even if the process costs may be higher than traditional manu-
facturing methods at this stage, the technological process can reduce
other type of costs, such as inventory and warehouse costs. From a
product design and quality management point of view, such technolo-
gies can phase in new revisions (be it due to upgrading of product
features or fixing design quality issue) without scrapping obsolete in-
ventory.


From a manufacturing and supply chain point of view, Holmström
et al. (2014) opinion on the advantages of using 3DP are widely cited:
(1) No tooling is needed significantly reducing production ramp-up
time and expense; (2) Small production batches are feasible and eco-
nomical; (3) Possibility to quickly change design; (4) Allows product to
be optimised for function (for example optimised cooling channels); (5)


Allows economical custom products (batch of one); (6) Possibility to
reduce waste; (7) Potential for simpler supply chains; shorter lead
times, lower inventories; and (8) Design customisation.


In addition, in the report “Made in China 2025” which was pub-
lished by the China State Council in 2015, China has put the 3DP in-
dustry as one of the priorities in the first ten-year plan to upgrade the
manufacturing industry (China State Council, 2015). Indeed, 3DP is a
great challenge and also provides an extraordinary chance of historical
improvement for traditional Chinese manufactures (Lipson and
Kurman, 2013). Therefore, there is a need to understand the opportu-
nities and challenges of using 3DP in China. D'Aveni (2013) predicted
that the manufacturing edge of China would be fading out due to the
3DP technology. This is the reason why this study focuses on companies
in China.


2.2. 3DP and supply chain


If we have started a new industrial revolution (inter alia digital
manufacturing, Industry 4.0), 3DP is definitely a part of it and is con-
sidered as a game changer (Fawcett and Waller, 2014). 3DP production
can be started on a made-to-order basis (Gao et al., 2015). This will
reduce the amount of inventory stock up along a supply chain (Liu
et al., 2014). In other words, excessive inventory stocking due to un-
certain demand along a supply chain, known as the famous ‘Bullwhip
Effect’ (Lee et al., 1997), should accordingly be reduced. If the ‘Bull-
whip Effect’ is a critical problem in any supply chain, perhaps 3DP can
be the solution?


Numerous studies have discussed the impact of 3DP on manu-
facturing and supply chain. The majority of these studies point to
customisation (Eyers and Dotchev, 2010; Berman, 2012; Rayna et al.,
2015). One extreme of the spectrum is, of course, to produce a quantity
of one single unit. This was coined by Petrick and Simpson (2013) as
“economies of one,” in contrast to economies of scale for mass pro-
duction. Undoubtedly most companies will fall between the extremes of
this spectrum. The implication, however, is that with the 3DP tech-
nology, the configuration of the supply chain and hence the associated
business models would inevitably be changed. Customisation will allow
easier product differentiation than the traditional supply chain models,
and also allow for small quantity production by companies. Both fea-
tures will change the way the traditional supply chain operates. One
simple effect is that the number of suppliers can be reduced drastically
due to the flexibility 3DP can deliver. In an extreme scenario, the only
supplier would be the materials supplier for the 3DP process during the
production phase (Mellor et al., 2014). The focus will be leaning more
towards the customer end (Christopher and Ryals, 2014).


Since 3DP production can take place with minimum amount of la-
bour involved, labour cost is less of an issue in view of the overall
product cost. The location of production thus becomes less sensitive and
there could be a re-shuffle of production facilities. For example, some
factories may move back to the source of consumption, as with many
developed countries (D'Aveni, 2013; Gebler et al., 2014; Mellor et al.,
2014). At least the existing outsourcing models may change accord-
ingly. This may also create a new paradigm of distributed manu-
facturing (Khajavi et al., 2014).


Another potential advantage of 3DP to the supply chain is that the
technology can simplify some production processes (e.g. a module can
be printed in one 3DP process rather than by assembling several com-
ponents which may require different supply chains). It is a decen-
tralized manufacturing technique that will alter distribution network.
In this sense, the level of complexity and overhead required of a product
or a supply chain can be reduced, and consequently the operation of the
supply chain is more efficient (Holmström and Partanen, 2013), and the
flexibility that 3DP offers more variety of end products. This efficiency
can also be complemented by the increased quality for simplified parts
or modules that the 3DP process can achieve compared to traditional
labour intensive operations.

In practice, some large shipping companies and port authorities
have started to encompass 3DP technology in their supply chain. For
example, Maersk has installed 3D printers in their ships since 2014 to
guarantee smooth operation in their shipping logistics. By utilising the
technology's characteristic of print on demand, it solved any impromptu
scenarios occurring due to malfunctioning mechanical ship parts. The
technical support on the ship is able to immediate replace a spare part
before reaching port. Meanwhile, the Port of Rotterdam has initiated
3D Fieldlab, to improve digital manufacturing infrastructure knowledge
regarding additive manufacturing and to apply that knowledge to
maritime and port-related industries (Port of Rotterdam, 2017).


Rogers et al. (2016) have provided a comprehensive review re-
garding the implications of 3DP on the supply chain. Therefore, the
authors will not elaborate that point further and readers are referred to
Rogers et al. (2016) for more details. The interesting findings from the
literature is that the benefits of 3DP on manufacturing and supply chain
management have been discussed widely, but there is limited evidence
to demonstrate that successful mass scale applications of 3DP have
taken place. In this connection, this research aims to explore this issue
in order to uncover the challenges in deploying the 3DP technology.


2.3. 3DP and IP


3DP technology can be used to create any genre of product.
Therefore, the ability to print unethical objects, such as lethal weapons
or more specifically guns, would jeopardise public security and safety
(Desai and Magliocca, 2013). Therefore, regulation should cover what
should be, and what should not be, permissible objects to print. There
has been much coverage in countries such as the UK and US on this
point, with variable results (e.g., BBC News, 2018; Farivar, 2018).
Nevertheless, this is not the core focus of this paper and hence no
further discussion is made in this paper on this area of debate.


In addition, it is very easy to apply the technology to infringe IP in
digital and analogue content, even if the users are infringing unin-
tentionally. Due to the wide coverage of the Internet and the develop-
ment of communication technology, the owners of printable content are
able to upload files onto the Internet. Thus, interested individuals or
companies are able to download the file without payment (Depoorter,
2013; Peacock, 2014). Afterwards, it is possible to redesign the down-
loaded content and print it out very easily. It might be acceptable if it is
for individual use or educational use. However, there is a possibility
that the newly printed content will go to the market for commercial
reasons. Likewise, the contents of legally patented products are acces-
sible to the public, who might print the products and sell exactly the
same products to the market directly by scanning the objects. Larger
companies have the resources available to them in assisting them with
tracking the origin of printed goods shared without their permission,
however, it is difficult for small and medium size enterprises (Lessig,
2001).


In principle, the design of any physical object could be capable of
some form of IP protection, so any means of replication (e.g., scanning,
in other words copying, a physical object and then printing it using a 3D
printer) could be a breach of an IP right. The 3DP process is digital in
nature so it is easier than ever before to “steal” a product design and
then make small batch production. The situation is complicated by the
current e-commerce technology. Imagine if these infringed products are
sold online (e.g., e-bay or Taobao in China) - it is very difficult for the IP
owners to track the origin of the infringement.


Additionally, 3DP processes and products differ from other ‘pro-
ducts’, like physical products, music, films, and so forth. The products
are more complex and, currently, new to the public. For example,
Chinese IP regulation has not yet covered this area. Meanwhile, many
3DP companies attempt to develop a new means of creating and dis-
seminating 3D printed content utilising their 3DP systems and to cap-
ture new business opportunities. However, their opportunities have
been limited because of the complex legal licensing environment, a lack


of appropriate digital licensing standards, and the possibility of being
held liable for the infringing acts of users.


In this connection, a proactive approach to protect copyrighted
objects is more desirable (Rideout, 2011). In fact, many companies do
respect IP, for example, by paying for the corresponding licensing fee.
Without seeing real business potential, companies will not invest in 3DP
though. In the UK, the relevant regulatory body called the Copyright
Hub has set out a list of licensing standards to use in online licensing
systems (El-Nazer, 2016). One objective of this research is to explore
the appropriateness of these guidelines to the Chinese context, in order
to propose a suitable licensing system in China.


2.4. Concluding remark from the review


This section briefly summarises the findings from the review and
how they are related to the research questions discussed in Section 1.
Many authors have discussed and suggested the merits of 3DP. Never-
theless, there is limited research to reveal mass applications of 3DP in
the industry. Current applications are mainly to replace existing pro-
cesses, rather than innovative application of 3DP. The situation is si-
milar to the adoption of other technologies (e.g., RFID). Many inter-
viewees considered that 3DP is an important element to pursue within a
digital supply chain, but it can be achieved only if 3DP can be in-
tegrated into supply chains well. In addition, legislation does not pro-
vide sufficient support to protect 3D printed contents. The digital
nature of the 3DP process make content infringement easy. This is
analogous to downloading music or videos from web pages. Many
people download the content without permission of the right holder
(Gower, 2006). A licencing framework could be the solution, and
coupled with current information technology, an online automatic li-
censing mechanism could promote the applications of 3DP. This can
also facilitate the integration of 3DP into supply chains as well. In order
to substantiate this, the study aims to discuss the opportunities and
challenges of using 3DP from manufacturing and legal perspective. This
is the first study in the literature to investigate these two perspectives
and to suggest this solution.


3. Research design and method


Based on the reviews in Section 2.2 and Section 2.3, two research
questions are investigated in this paper: (1) the current application of
3DP technology in the industry and the associated challenges; and (2)
from a legal perspective how to protect 3D-printed content in order to
help improve the penetration of the technology to the industry.


In order to address the above research questions, empirical quali-
tative data is required. The nature of the problem is exploratory in
nature, and a qualitative type of research is more appropriate at this
stage. In April 2016, 14 semi-structured interviews were thus con-
ducted, each of which lasts for around 1 h. Another 14 semi-structure
interviews were conducted in August 2016. Table A1 in the Appendix
lists the 28 companies and their information.


The sampling of these interviews is chosen to cover companies that
are related to various 3DP stakeholders. They could be printers, man-
ufacturers, and so on. The natures of their business are: (1) Chinese 3DP
manufacturer and 3DP distributor of foreign brands; (2) 3DP and
scanning software suppliers; (3) 3DP material suppliers and material
institutions; and (4) 3DP solution providers. The business area of the
majority of the companies covers rapid prototyping and moulding of
fashion products, mass customisation of spare parts (in ships, jet en-
gines, and aerospace), and for education science training. The compa-
nies interviewed are located in major industrial areas in China in-
cluding Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hangzhou and Ningbo. The
interviewees are either founders, general managers, legal officers or
technical managers who have good understanding on the 3DP operation
and business in China.

4. Findings and discussions


4.1. 3DP and supply chain


Our initial questions are related to the application of 3DP in the
manufacturing and supply chain sectors. This serves to confirm the
potential capability of 3DP to the industry, and to explore the chal-
lenges faced by the industry. Generally, the responses about the ap-
plication of 3DP are positive. In particular, three areas can be identified
which are discussed further in the following sub-sections.


4.1.1. R&D and design
Although material costs and operating costs of the 3DP process may


still be higher than traditional manufacturing process, it is generally
agreed that 3DP can help reduce the development cost of products.
Interviewee 2 stated that “3DP does have some significant impact in some
industries. It is mainly because with 3DP technology, it will improve effi-
ciency and significantly lower the cost”. In addition, 3DP can shorten the
development time drastically. It is because, according to interviewee
22, “traditionally you have to design the machine and mould based on what
you like to produce, but 3DP changes the old way so that you don't have to
design them”. Interviewee 18 supplemented this, by stating that “it is a
waste to develop a prototype and mould by using conventional method. 3DP
can stand out and give you an economic solution” in this aspect. This is
also the early utilisation of 3DP, i.e., rapid prototyping.


One of the interviewees, interviewee 5, provides such a service to
foreign trading customers. When the company receives a physical
sample from the customers, they scan it and then 3D-print it out. It is
even easier if the customers can provide the company with a digital file.
This is a new business model that can provide a fast turnaround time to
the end customers without any tooling. This business model enables the
customers to modify the design based on the 3D-printed samples and
they can get the revised version very quickly. With such physical
samples, the customers can minimise the risks in the product design
process. They can also order a number of samples with different design
options for testing at the same time, without expending extreme effort.
Interviewee 7 mentioned that a WiFi device took half a year to progress
through the tooling fabrication and testing phases, not to mention the
high tooling cost involved. 3DP can also reduce both development lead
time and associated costs.


The main implication of this area is that it is easier to produce a new
product in smaller quantities with relatively affordable capital, by using
3DP technology. It is also easier to build a new brand in the market, and
this is particularly favourable to small and start-up companies. With the
assistance of 3DP, companies can then move from Original Equipment
Manufacturing (OEM) or contract manufacturing to Original Design
Manufacturing (ODM). In ODM manufacturing mode, designers and
manufacturers in the value chain must communicate and collaborate
during the manufacturing process. Liao et al. (2017) have proved that
supply chain collaboration enhances innovation of firms, which even-
tually provide a competitive advantage (Liao et al., 2017). This is ex-
actly what the ‘Made-in-China 2025’ initiative would like to achieve in
China. However, how such start-ups and small companies, normally
faced with limited resources, can protect their IP and ensure that the
design is free from infringement, is another challenge that we will
discuss further in a subsequent section.


4.1.2. Manufacturing and supply chain
Notwithstanding the cost benefit 3DP can bring to the product de-


sign process, the shortcoming of 3DP aligns with the reported studies
that the unit manufacturing cost is still significantly higher than the
traditional counterpart. This is still the major barrier in achieving the
full potential of 3DP. In other words, there is a pressing need to in-
corporate additional value in the 3D printed parts or components to
compensate for this high cost. For example, 3DP is (almost) mould-free.
This characteristic of 3DP can reduce the maintenance costs and tooling


costs of moulds, which can bring some benefits to some industries.
According to interviewee 22, the next question is how to leverage costs,
such as economy of scale from mass production. This is also echoed by
interviewee 18, that in some industries “current moulding is quite con-
venient and we can make it cheap and nice”.


One way to counteract the barrier is to employ 3DP in a different
manufacturing or supply chain. Mass customisation has unanimously
been considered the merit of 3DP in manufacturing and supply chain.
Interviewee 16 and interviewee 21 both confirmed that small batch
production is more feasible with 3DP, especially when the demand is
uncertain. 3DP allows for product differentiation. Interviewee 2 gave an
example of car headlights in his production line. There could be six
options that mean the companies needed to stock up inventory for six
stock-keeping units. It is costly and timing consuming to design and
manage the corresponding moulds. With 3DP, interviewee 2 can take
just one week to finish this task. Another way to further enhance the
productivity of the 3DP industry could be to set up a service centre for
3DP. Interviewee 12 stated “this centre will serve the local enterprises to
enhance their competitiveness”.


Based on the interviews, 3DP cannot only reduce cost and time of
product development and manufacturing, but help counteract the un-
certainty of demand since the supply chain can be more responsive.
This is because production can take place at a unit quantity level.
Manufacturers do not need to stock up different types of materials other
than the materials for 3DP, which can be used to produce different
types of parts and products. Effectively, there is no need to manage the
supply chain in this sense. Demand for the materials is aggregated by
the technology itself, even if the demand information is not available to
the manufacturers and the suppliers. To achieve this paradigm is of
course not easy and currently the industry is still far from this.
However, the ability to introducing customisation can help manage the
demand uncertainty of the supply chains. This is especially important
with the current pace of technological development that leads to fast
changing customer demand.


Another obvious barrier to apply 3DP in the industry is the re-
cognition of the technology to some industries. This is somehow related
to the cost of 3D-printed parts, and the material in relation to printing.
Industries with high value products, such as the medical and auto-
mobile industries, can more easily incorporate 3DP in their manu-
facturing process. Some interesting industries, such as glass production,
do not even require tooling. Therefore, the added value of using 3DP
technology would be very much dependent on the time and cost to print
a product or parts within particular industries.


4.1.3. Data management
Coupled with the capability of customisation, good data manage-


ment can facilitate 3DP, and vice versa. It is because the value behind
the customisation is customer preference and behaviour. Interviewee
15 worked with her customers, in that data from those customers who,
in turn, obtained scanned data via the cloud, are synchronised. This
allowed interviewee 15 to work on the data and revise the design. This
allowed interviewee 15 to make sure that the design is truly customised
and would not infringe other designs in the database. Obviously, this
links to the IP issues that will be discussed in the subsequent section.
Regardless of the IP issues, this way to exchange information is not
restricted to the product design for printing. For example, interviewee
18 also incorporated patients' information so that the medical products
produced by them can be easily customised for the next generations of
products. This aligns with the recent big data research and analysis
trends. That alignment can help companies to trace 3D-printed contents
along the supply chain, according to interviewee 19. This can further
assist mass customisation mentioned above because this really can
achieve the no-supply-chain utopia.


H.K. Chan et al.






























4.2. 3DP and IP protection


The next set of questions is to investigate how IP issues would effect
the deployment of 3DP technology to the industry, and if so, how this
challenge can be overcome. Through the semi-structured interviews, we
are able to understand the current phenomenon of legal issues re-
garding the 3DP industry. One major reason behind the unregulated
environment in China's 3DP industry is due to fact that the industry is
dynamic, fast growing, but on a very limited scale and which is, cur-
rently, unable to regulate itself. Roughly speaking, half of the inter-
viewed companies are completely ignorant of Intellectual Property
Rights (IPR). For those who are interested in IPR, they mainly concern
patents. Interviewee 2 said: “Good patents always lead to good product
lines. A good product means a big market”. The reason is obvious as pa-
tents can help them to protect the business in terms of profits, and re-
frain, or at least delay, their competitors from reaching the market. The
only distinctive segment that is more aware and knowledgeable of the
law is those companies producing medical parts or devices.


According to an interviewee, the local market experienced a rapid
growth in 2012 under multiple incentive policies from the Chinese
government and exaggerated promotion of media has attracted a lot of
players from various dissimilar fields. According to another interviewee
who is also an entrepreneur from a leading company, the local gov-
ernment attracts industry newcomers with lucrative packages, which
include three years' exemption of office rental and monetary reward for
IP awarded 3D technology. He further commented, “The biggest pro-
blem in China's 3DP industry is that it is with very low entry barrier
with very niche market. The competition in this industry is very fierce
because of the exaggeration of media that demonstrates public an il-
lusion of the idea that the 3DP industry is the future. The reality is
always cruelly disparate, in order to survive in the market, low price
strategy is the only strategy. Thus, low quality and patent troll [s] are
the outcomes.”


On the other hand, the process and content of 3DP products are
different from many other traditional objects or services, as they are
more complex. There are difficulties in tracing the origins of source
materials, as reflected from the interviews with bio-printing companies.
Moreover, the nature of IP law is complicated, and when old laws meet
new technology, it is often the case that legislation is unable to fit into
the new eco-system. Therefore, it is difficult to offer effective protec-
tion.


The majority of the interviewed companies responded that legal
protection of contract law has covered the rights and interested of
companies, whose role resemble service providers based on the items
provided by the customers. The customers have to agree with the ser-
vice providers that they are not responsible on the IP of the items. There
is no incentive for companies to trace the originality of the item when
they are already protected under the contract law's umbrella. A general
manager of a local B2B manufacturer, stated that, “There is no way for
us to trace the originality of the content given by customer. For in-
stance, if someone gives us an iPhone, we will know that it is from
Apple. However, most of the time when the product is received, we
have no idea where or who the product/content belongs to.
Furthermore, the bargaining power of customers is always stronger
than us, if we emphasised too much on content originality, the customer
can always choose to go for another company who does not ask for
originality to complete the printing. We are too weak to pursue for
intellectual property when there is lack of practical guidance on the law
in the industry.”


At the same time, there are also some companies we interviewed
who already saw the importance of IP protection of 3DP products. The
chairman of a 3DP association in Hangzhou has adopted a creative
method to encourage open source printable content designers to con-
tinuously contribute their innovation to an open source platform, where
he allocates “profit share for content designer” after the product goes to
mass production. The corresponding designer receives reward for their


creativity. In the meantime, the manufacturer would change the image
of “Made in China”, which sometimes can indicate an infringement IP
product, to “Created in China”. The companies could strengthen their
brand reputation and image by selling authorised 3D products. This is a
“win-win-win” situation. He commented, “Open source is the future,
there will be only two types of factories in future, one is for printing
material and another for production. We can produce everything at any
time and are able to supply to the whole world. Till then, the standard
and regulation of IP will automatically be set. If IP law applies at this
dynamic stage, it will discourage designers to free their mind, there will
be no imagination, then the industry will end.”


The value chain of 3DP is straightforward, with the combination of
equipment vendors, distributors and resellers, service providers, and
also, material and software providers. When discussing the relationship
between IP and technology, there are various formulations of IP, for
instance, copyright, patent, trademark, registered design and utility
patent. All of these terms are related to different value chain. An in-
terviewee from a 3DP materials research institution proved that, “We
update our hardware frequently so we will not apply a patent for every
stage's incremental improvement, we would also keep as trade secrets
by not disclosing to the public. Furthermore, if someone wants to use
our equipment, he only needs our formal license on the application of
the technology but not on the intellectual of product because the pro-
duct is only the result of mass production, which does not follow the
nature of the patent right.”


Nowadays, it is easier to access and obtain digital content due to the
availability of file sharing. More importantly, this allows individuals to
obtain digital printable content online without any payment to the
content owner. Individuals can then customise and print an object for
personal purposes. This leads to serious brand dilution as there is no
way for a company to track counterfeiting. It is also extremely difficult
to detect infringing activities which lead to prohibited usage of an IP
protected item. This is complicated by a lack of IP standards and reg-
ulation for the 3DP industry.


In fact, the cost to protect IP for 3DP applications is very high, not to
mention that it is very time consuming, as a heavy workload is re-
quired. This creates conflicts between innovation and business oppor-
tunities. With the establishment of an automatic single licensing online
platform, all the IP content is automatically protected. Users of 3DP
content pay a small amount every time they access the content via the
platform, e.g. through advertising (like those on YouTube) or through
the monitoring of use (e.g. Facebook). Meanwhile, the right holder
receives reward of their innovative works by inter alia automated pay-
per-click downloads, and are able to track the usage activities of whom,
where and how is their IP are being used. This couples with recent trend
in ‘big-data’ analysis.


From the industry's perspective, the automatic licensing method
protects the originality of companies' products which exempt IP-cau-
tious applicants from complex and confusing legal terms. Consequently,
this encourages innovators to innovate under the protection of a flexible
and less intrusive legal system. Under this system, all the stakeholders
in the industry are more disciplined to avoid legal disputes, as regula-
tion and standards will set in automatically to work as a regulator. From
the interviews, it is commonly agreed that a watermarking system can
be utilised to protect 3DP content. One method to execute this is to
“add” a watermark on the 3DP content that can be recognised later.
Then, licensed 3DP content can be distinguished. This system can be
operated online automatically. In this connection, this is the extension
of this exploratory study to develop such watermarking technology.1


1 The watermarking technology has been filed for invention patent applica-
tion in China (Application number is 2017104694528).

5. Conclusions


The main implication of this study, via the semi-structured inter-
views, is that 3PD is not yet ready for mass scale applications. Although
many practitioners can visualise the benefits and potential impacts of
3PD, it has not been as widely deployed as many studies predicted.
Many players are reluctant to integrate it into their supply chain pro-
cesses. It is still too early to conclude that the mass production era has
been replaced by the mass customisation era. In fact, the opposite is
probably more accurate according to the interviews. 3DP has created a
lot of ‘hopes’ but at this stage 3DP has still not fully delivered its pro-
mise. The key message from the interviews is that in order to fully
extract the value of 3DP, it cannot be used to replace existing processes.
Innovative design such as open platforms with a good data management
system would be feasible route to incorporate 3DP in the digital supply
chain era. This will introduce innovative usage of the 3DP processes,
rather than manufacturing. Such system can be blended with the pro-
posed automatic licensing system that can counteract IP protection is-
sues. This is the first study to investigate these issues in the field.


Nonetheless, this study also argues that 3DP itself, among other
technologies and technological development, enables the transition.
The authors do not assert that the mass production type of methods will
be entirely phased out, but it will be complemented by the demand for
mass customisation. This is supported by interviewee 21: “I don't think it
(3DP) can replace the traditional manufacture”. However, many


interviewees predict that as more 3PD service providers or manu-
facturers will appear in the market, but 3DP that is easier to incorporate
into various manufacturing and supply chain applications.


Another managerial implication confirmed from this study is that
there is a need to protect the IP in 3DP content. An online automated
licensing platform, where content is IP protected, is proposed. The li-
censing platform could regulate authorised 3DP by tracking content and
product information throughout the value chain. The proposed plat-
form will be supported by watermarking technology for 3DP content,
which is under invention patent application, discussed at the end of
Section 4. The main objective is to prove the proposed concept is fea-
sible and to resolve any technical barriers when the concept is used in
real applications. This system is a proof-of-concept, and if successful
can be extended to a real commercial system, analogous to the UK
Digital Copyright Hub system.
