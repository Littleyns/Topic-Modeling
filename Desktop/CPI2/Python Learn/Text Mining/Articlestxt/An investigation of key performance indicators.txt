Abstract


Operational excellence refers to a mixed management structure that enhances the


productivity of an industry by exercising the best practices and efforts for continu-


ous improvement. In order to achieve sustainability, operational excellence initia-


tives are practiced by different organizations. The intent is to investigate how to


perform the practices of operational excellence towards sustainability in industries.


In the existing literature, some studies investigated key performance indicators


(KPIs) for other domains that are not readily applicable in the background of an


emerging economy, principally for the leather products industry. To fulfill these


research gaps, this study contributes to the operational excellence literature by


recognizing the KPIs of operational excellence towards sustainability by examining


the peer-reviewed scientific articles and through expert's suggestions. The identi-


fied KPIs are segregated into six dominant categories and 27 sub-KPIs in the field


of leather products industry. Further, the prioritization of the KPIs is established


by adopting the best-worst method (BWM), which involves simple pairwise com-


parison matrices compared with other multicriteria decision making techniques.


The findings indicate that the KPIs under the “Management” category are at the


highest priority. It is anticipated that the results originated from the study will sup-


port the expert's to appropriately recognize the significant KPIs and drop insignifi-


cant KPIs for successful operational excellence towards sustainability practices in


the supply chain of the emerging economy.

1 | INTRODUCTION


Today's business scenarios are becoming more complicated due to


the variety of customer demands, enhancements in technology, and


global integration (Mukonz, & Swarts, 2020; Centobelli, Cerchione, &


Ertz, 2020). Concerns about product quality, increased product diver-


sity, and continually fluctuating markets are some of the essential


components responsible for these varying business conditions


(Agrawal & Singh, 2019; Bartolacci, Caputo, & Soverchia, 2019).


Accordingly, leather, leather goods, and footwear manufacturing

industries are under tremendous pressure to innovate their opera-


tional performance to counter these recent advancements. These


manufacturing industries are compelled to automate and upgrade,


which further escalates the manufacturing expenditures (Kazancoglu,


Sagnak, Kayikci, & Kumar Mangla, 2020). Moreover, the leather sector


of Bangladesh is an essential domain for the financial growth of the


country. In order to sustain a competitive edge, this industrial sector


needs to be capable of reacting and adjusting to the modifications cre-


ated by an ambiguous environment (Dahlmann & Roehrich, 2019;


Schaltegger & Wagner, 2011). In order to actively react to market cir-


cumstances, this industrial sector must practice excellence in their


business. One approach is the quest for operational excellence, which


helps this industrial sector navigate a pathway to attain their ambi-


tions and objectives.


The term “operational excellence” originated from the Shingo


Institute at Utah State University and commonly referred to the con-


tinuous developments various industries employ within their ecosys-


tems to attain a competitive edge (Sony, 2019). Operational


excellence is a necessary element of industry architecture and busi-


ness excellence that attempts to enhance essential functioning perfor-


mance parameters and can be accomplished by meeting the


expectations of all participants (Shehadeh, Al-Zu'bi, Abdallah, &


Maqableh, 2016). However, industries require practical and compre-


hensive supervision to attain operational excellence. Similarly, indus-


tries operating in different domains aim to achieve excellence in


business to enhance their overall performance. Many industries fail to


attain the height of excellence because they do not fully understand


the true meaning of the same (Fok-Yew & Ahmad, 2014). There is


undoubtedly a need for a list of instructions illustrating how industries


may attain operational excellence.


When considering operational excellence, academics and industry


consultants prefer to associate it with the manufacturing division


because the manufacturing process is one of the main strategic parts


of a business (Ahmed & Nuland, 2017). In the present study, the


leather products industry of Bangladesh, a dominant manufacturing


sector, is taken into consideration. The Bangladeshi leather sector


contributes significantly to the economy of the country and is the


second-largest source of exports. It includes around 220 tanneries,


110 large firms, and 3,500 small and medium enterprises (SMEs)


(Moktadir, Rahman, Jabbour, Ali, & Kabir, 2018). According to the


Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) of Bangladesh, the Bangladeshi


leather industry contributes around 10% to the global leather busi-


ness. The data from the EPB confirmed that in the first 8 months of


FY2019–2020, the export of leather goods and footwear was around


USD 851 million (Report, 2020). The industry has the capability of


generating jobs and venture capital by creating convenience for


export businesses, as Bangladeshi leather products including leather


bags, ladies purses, money bags, belts, shoes, leather jackets, gloves,


and credit card cases are imported to many countries including Italy,


Spain, Germany, United States, United Kingdom, and Canada


(Hoque & Clarke, 2013).


A lump of waste is generated by different manufacturing opera-


tions functioning within the leather products industry. If the


manufacturing operations are green, the amount of waste generated


should be considerably low (Dwivedi, Agrawal, & Madaan, 2019; Yang


et al., 2019). Therefore, the employment of sustainable operational


practices in the Bangladeshi leather products industry is a challenge.


Studies related to performance enhancement in different manufactur-


ing industries functional in Bangladesh primarily focused on small and


medium organizations. In the literature, a few studies were available


in the sphere of the leather industry, which is entirely different from


the operational excellence and sustainability in the leather products


industry (Moktadir, Ali, Rajesh, & Paul, 2018; Moktadir, Ali, Paul, &


Shukla, 2019; Moktadir, Ali, Kusi-Sarpong, & Shaikh, 2018). Previous


studies disclosed how operations management has linked sustainabil-


ity issues via the practice of operational excellence (Mani &


Gunasekaran, 2018). To stay upfront in the competition, the leather


products industry needs refining, achieved by incorporating the latest


approaches and concepts into their businesses to attain superiority


and sustainability. Operational excellence mostly contains the most


comprehensive and latest technological approaches for industrial utili-


zation in the form of blockchain, Internet of things, information and


communication technologies, artificial intelligent, cloud computing,


and others (Gai, Beath, Fang, & Lou, 2020; Sartal & Vázquez, 2017).


Sustainable practices can significantly contribute to achieving bril-


liance in the industry performance (Luthra, Govindan, Kannan, Man-


gla, & Garg, 2017) and can intensify the architecture and sustainability


aspects of the traditional supply chains (Mangla et al., 2019).


Operational excellence is an essential subject of interest but has


been a challenge for both industry and academia. Most of the previ-


ous operational excellence studies considered the case of different


manufacturing industries, but there is a paucity of studies linked to


operational excellence practices concerning leather industries func-


tional in Bangladesh (Paul, Antunes, Covington, Evans, &


Phillips, 2013; Moktadir, Ali, Rajesh, et al., 2018; Moktadir, Rahman,


Rahman, Ali, & Paul, 2018; Moktadir, Ahmadi, Sultana, Liou, &


Rezaei, 2020). There has been very little research conducted to estab-


lish an operational excellence structure for the leather products indus-


try. Therefore, scientific knowledge and research could assist the


Bangladeshi leather products industry in employing operational excel-


lence practices towards sustainability. To guide the leather products


industry on their way towards sustainability via operational excellence


approaches, this study addresses the following research questions


(RQs):


RQ1: What are the potential key performance indicators (KPIs)


for operational excellence towards sustainability in the context of the


leather products industry?


RQ2: How to determine the relative significance of KPIs for oper-


ational excellence?


RQ3: How to articulate the performance index for the leather


products companies considering KPIs?


RQ4: What would be the managerial and policy implications of


the study findings for the business strategy development?


Therefore, the present study adds value to the operational excel-


lence literature by addressing the above-mentioned RQs. The objec-


tives of the study are

a. Identifying the most relevant KPIs under the six different prospects


for practicing operational excellence towards sustainability in the


leather products industry using a qualitative approach.


b. Determining the relative significance of the identified KPIs


employing quantitative BWM.


c. Developing a performance index considering domain expert's input


for the case companies to investigate the existing operational


performance.


d. Introducing managerial and policy implications deduced from the


study.


To respond to the proposed objectives listed above, an analytical


framework based on qualitative and quantitative approaches for iden-


tifying and investigating the KPIs is developed for the leather prod-


ucts industry. For this, at first, a rigorous literature review is


performed within the domain of operational excellence to identify the


potential KPIs. Then, a qualitative approach based on expert's opin-


ions is undertaken to identify and finalize the KPIs for the leather


products industry. Next, to investigate the operational excellence, rel-


ative weights of the KPIs are determined and prioritized as per their


influence on operational excellence towards sustainability, employing


the BWM. Next, the performance index of case companies is obtained


to comprehend the actual operational performance of these case


companies concerning the identified KPIs.


In this study, a quantitative decision tool, BWM has used for the


following reasons: (a) BWM is a novel technique where the number of


pairwise comparison matrices is less compared with other MCDM


techniques like analytical hierarchy process (AHP), fuzzy AHP, deci-


sion making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL), gray-


DEMATEL, analytical network process (ANP) resulting time-saving in


decision making process (Mi, Tang, Liao, Shen, & Lev, 2019; Rezaei,


2015); and (b) BWM generates exceptionally reliable results with


lower consistency ratio (Gupta, Anand, & Gupta, 2017; van de Kaa


et al., 2017).


The paper is arranged as per the following sections. Section 2 dis-


cusses the literature review on operational excellence, existing works


on KPIs, research gaps and highlights, and categorization of KPIs. The


research design and methodology are presented in Section 3. A real-


world case presentation of the suggested methodology is explained in


Section 4. Section 5 broadly discusses the results and findings from


the study, and Section 6 includes the conclusion, implications, and


recommendations of the study.


2 | LITERATURE REVIEW


In this section, the objective is to add insights towards operational


excellence studies. The objective is attained by addressing the existing


literature related to operational excellence and KPIs. On the basis of


literature review, the research gaps and the key highlights are identi-


fied. Further, the KPIs are segregated into six categories based on the


literature survey and qualitative approach built on expert's sugges-


tions under this section.


2.1 | Operational excellence


The literature assessment reveals various ways to describe operational


excellence. The word “operational” refers to the assembly and distri-


bution of a product and to accomplish a specific task, while “excel-


lence” refers to a goal that must be met and sustained in order to


remain outstanding (Mitchell, 2015). In addition, operational excel-


lence is related to improving performance and efficiency across all


dimensions of the industry. It is associated with both the operating


performance (such as the measures of expense, quality, and resilience)


and sustainable performance (such as dealing with individuals and


resources effectively to support business expansion) (Zhu, Johnsson,


Varisco, & Schiraldi, 2018). In order to increase customer worth, oper-


ational excellence is equally concerned with manufacturing processes


as it is with waste minimization, and it generates interactions between


employees and customers (Chakraborty, Sharma, & Vaidya, 2020;


Dev, Shankar, & Qaiser, 2020). The architecture and administration of


operational excellence escalate operating profits by achieving stable


operational excellence in the production system, which supports cus-


tomers by offering them correct value for products and services.


In order to attain operational excellence towards sustainable


practices in industries, all three sustainability aspects (social, environ-


mental, and economic) must be studied (Gimenez, Sierra, &


Rodon, 2012). If operational excellence practices can assist in social


improvement, this may lead to opening or attracting new businesses


and sustaining the present collaborations (Sehnem, Jabbour, Pereira, &


de Sousa Jabbour, 2019). The social aspect of sustainable operational


excellence can escalate business expansion and stabilize operational


excellence programs. Industries operate for economic gains and gen-


eration of profits. The economic aspect of sustainable operational


excellence should moderately assure economic profitability. Sustain-


able operational excellence will only be achievable if it creates an eco-


nomic impact, but this must not be at the expense of environmental


and social impacts. The environmental aspect of operational excel-


lence decisions that lead to negative environmental outcomes must


be eradicated, even if such decisions are highly profitable for the


industry (Sony, 2019).


Operational excellence is the continued monitoring of the


industry's finest practices in the domain of operational performance,


health and safety, process reliability, and environmental conduct (Bag,


Wood, Mangla, & Luthra, 2020). It is a means of continuous enhance-


ment in the operations of the industries. Operational excellence has


been accredited and employed by various industries functioning in dif-


ferent domains. Many researchers have devoted substantial attention


to operational excellence practices and suggested various frameworks


for operational excellence in the context of different organizations.


Moktadir, Ali, Rajesh, et al. (2018) identified the barriers to sustainable


supply chain (SSC) management in the leather industry. The study


identified 20 potential barriers in suggestion with the expert's and


obtained the interrelationships among the barriers employing the


gray-DEMATEL approach. Sony (2019) presented a combined per-


spective of achieving sustainable operational excellence in industries.


In this study, the author suggests a framework for sustainable


MOKTADIR ET AL. 3333






























operational excellence considering the triple bottom line of sustain-


ability aspects. Uddin et al. (2019) suggested a framework to identify


the barriers to green supply chain management (GSCM) in the leather


industry. The study adopted ELimination Et Choice Translating REality


(ELECTRE) and AHP approach to instigating GSCM in the leather


industry. Dwivedi et al. (2019) suggested a sustainable manufacturing


framework focusing leather industry. The study adopted the Total


Interpretive Structural Modeling (TISM) approach and kappa analysis


for obtaining the interrelation among the factors. Moktadir, Dwivedit,


et al. (2019) identified the antecedents for the adoption of green


human resource management in the context of the tannery industry.


In this study, authors used TISM approach to make a contextual rela-


tionship among identified antecedents.


Similarly, Chakraborty et al. (2020) attained sustainable opera-


tional excellence through information technology (IT) applications in


an Indian context. The study adopted ISM and fuzzy-MICMAC meth-


odology to analyze the barriers in effective IT implementation, consid-


ering the expert's from the organized and unorganized logistics


sectors. Hasan, Javed, and Farooq (2020) suggested strategies for the


growth of the leather industry. The study has employed AHP and con-


tent analysis to identify and rank the strategies that can be employed


by the leather industry for effectual growth. Also, Sehnem et al. (2019)


performed an analysis for enhancing the performance of SSCs through


the practices of operational excellence and circular economy (CE). This


study suggests the companies to manage the success factors related


to CE adoption and the influence of firms' in encouraging the


CE. Muazu (2019) studied the antecedents of research within the


domain of the oil and gas industry. The results from the study reflect


that health, safety, and environmental performance has declined while


incidents and fatalities issues are rising, irrespective of the adoption


of operational excellence practices.


A number of studies are highlighted above in the context of oper-


ational excellence adoption towards sustainability in different


manufacturing industries. Although, there are numerous studies in the


field of the leather industry, still study related to the adoption of sus-


tainable operational excellence practices in leather products industry


is missing in the literature. Therefore, to attain operational excellence,


the leather products industry must search for creative ideas to inte-


grate conformity into its production and operational framework.


Although there are numerous studies related to this field, several


scopes of operational excellence still require further investigation.


2.2 | Existing work on KPIs


The important objectives for attaining operational excellence towards


sustainability practices are primarily revealed by an enterprise's


demand for success. Further, each objective is assisted by a list of spe-


cific indicators that contribute to attaining the desired objectives. As a


set of quantitative and strategic measures that demonstrate the suc-


cess of an organization, KPIs establish an enterprise's objectives and


provide ways to measure and manage improvements for further learn-


ing to achieve these objectives. There are a set of standards that


target the most relevant elements of organizational performance and


are necessary for future progress (Parmenter, 2007). KPIs play a vital


role in transforming organizational objectives into existence and sup-


port organizations to understand their performance within the context


of their objectives. KPIs are an effective instrument for appraising per-


formance and can be defined as a measure of success or consent.


They allow industries to identify those operations that are performing


well and those need future enhancements. They also facilitate to rec-


ognize and remodel the performance systems of the manufacturing


industries. Because KPIs consist of an extensive range of elements in


the form of objectives, such as analysis, modeling, and measurement,


it becomes difficult to define them accurately. Therefore, organiza-


tions depend on managers to designate appropriate KPIs. The efficient


adoption of KPIs is becoming increasingly important in the current


business environment. KPIs are necessary for attaining operational


excellence towards sustainability as


1. KPIs can specify decisive information which can lay the ground-


work for enforcing development planning (Bag, Xu, Dhamija, &


Kayikci, 2020);


2. KPIs present an approach to visualize whether strategic arrange-


ments are working to drive the desired objectives;


3. The adoption of KPIs can lead to improvements in the productivity


and profitability of the organizations (Horta, Camanho, & Da


Costa, 2010).


In the literature survey, many studies highlighted the KPIs rele-


vant to different industries. A few studies turned their attention to


KPIs related to the leather industry, automobile industry, and


healthcare, as well as looking at the pressures of sustainable


manufacturing, but surprisingly study related to the leather products


industry was missing. Addis, Dvivedi, and Beshah (2017) performed an


analysis of the operational performance indicators in the background


of Ethiopian leather industry using the customer preference rating


approach. The study identified five key operational performance indi-


cators that have high influence on the production performance of the


Ethiopian leather industry. The results reported that flexibility and


quality are the most imperative indicators for enhancing the industry's


production performance. Also, Kaganski, Majak, and Karjust (2018)


prioritized KPIs based on Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant


and Time-bound as well as Evaluated on a regular basis and Recog-


nized (SMARTER) criteria. The study adopted the fuzzy AHP tech-


nique to identify 13 KPIs and further prioritized them based on


expert's from different SMEs.


Similarly, Nurcahyo, Pustiwari, and Gabriel (2018) established


KPIs for manufacturing industries in Indonesia. The study adopted the


DEMATEL method to determine the causal relationship among the


critical factors for improving corporate sustainability. Further, Kailash,


Saha, and Goyal (2019) studied the KPIs of ISCM performance for


Indian manufacturing industries. In this study, authors adopted an


integrated fuzzy logic and AHP method to analyze the KPIs of internal


supply chain management (SCM) based on select manufacturing com-


panies. Amaladhasan, Parthiban, and Dhanalakshmi (2019) identified


3334 MOKTADIR ET AL.






































the KPIs for green supply chain (GSC) assessment in the domain of


the automobile industry. The study offered fuzzy-based


VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) and


gray relational analysis to prioritize the GSC performance in sugges-


tion with the expert's from five different industries. Feiz et al. (2020)


demonstrated the economic and environmental KPIs of the renewable


energy production system by adopting a life cycle assessment (LCA)


approach and ignored to examine the significance of proposed KPIs.


Li, Hong, Lee, and Sofos (2020) proposed system-level KPIs for build-


ing performance evaluation using a simulation based approach, and


the study findings were not suitable for the manufacturing industries.


Zhu et al. (2018) identified the KPIs for the process industries, which


were neglected by the KPIs series of ISO 22400. They offered a dis-


cussion and highlighted the difference between process industries


KPIs and KPIs of the manufacturing operation.


2.3 | Research gaps and highlights


From the above in-depth literature review, it was confirmed that, to


date, no study has examined the KPIs for operational excellence


towards sustainability in the field of the leather products industry. A


few studies analyzed KPIs in the context of manufacturing industries


but did not focus specifically on operational excellence towards sus-


tainability. Also, no study has evaluated the KPIs for operational excel-


lence towards sustainability based on six (management, operations,


quality, economic, social, and environmental) different categories for


the leather products industry. To successfully estimate operational


excellence, KPIs must be precisely explained according to the intent


and scope of the sustainability evaluation. In complex situations, cor-


relations between KPIs might also occur (Tsai, Chou, & Hsu, 2009).


Therefore, it is crucial to examine the significance of the various KPIs


for the leather products industry. To deal with the challenges above,


there is a need to establish a framework to identify KPIs for opera-


tional excellence towards sustainability practices in the leather prod-


ucts industry. Therefore, the present study is an effort to address the


above-mentioned research gaps. The highlights of the research are


listed below:


a. KPIs for operational excellence towards sustainability are identified


through literature review and qualitative expert's suggestions.


b. An MCDM-based framework has been suggested, which supports


the essential KPIs, and the priorities among the KPIs are deter-


mined to achieve operational excellence.


c. A performance index is established for the case companies by


arresting feedback from case companies expert's to determine the


operational performance of the industry.


2.4 | Categorization of the KPIs


KPIs can be arranged by a set of elements with similar characteristics.


Each KPI reveals the performance aspect of an organization.


Moreover, these KPIs must be reasonably categorized to explore the


fundamental interactions between them. Therefore, it is appropriate


to organize the KPIs into multiple groups at different levels with spe-


cific cross-links between them. In the present study, a set of KPIs for


operational excellence in the background of manufacturing industries


are determined through the literature review. The suggestions of the


expert's in the domain of leather products industry are incorporated


to finalize 19 potential KPIs relevant to the leather products industry.


Further, the identified 19 KPIs are clubbed under six (management,


operations, quality, economic, social, and environmental) aspects


based on the qualitative approach, that is, expert's suggestions as


reflected inTable 1.


2.4.1 | Management related KPIs


Manufacturing organizations find it challenging to attain their goals


due to certain process restrictions smoothly. If these restrictions are


well understood, KPIs can be identified more accurately and can also


assist with the improvements required to achieve goals (de Sousa


Jabbour, de Oliveira Frascareli, & Jabbour, 2015; Seleem, Attia, & El-


Assal, 2016). Therefore, it is essential to understand all the existing


restrictions before employing any performance employment initia-


tives. KPIs help management to determine the exercises that need


improvements to support the setting of new objectives, assist in


decision-making to attain the required performance, permit interpre-


tation of the organization's responsibility into detailed operational


practices, and assess the extent of the organization's success in


achieving its goal. In suggestion with the expert's, KPIs such as the


efficient inventory management facility, skilled management facility of


capacity utilization, and management facility of production monitoring


system are included within the category of management-related KPIs,


are presented inTable 1.


2.4.2 | Operations related KPIs


KPIs can help maintain the capability of an organization to establish


and transform itself while retaining productivity. They are employed


to evaluate performance and effectiveness throughout the different


manufacturing operations. Therefore, KPIs must be correctly identi-


fied and adopted to the particularity of the industry and should be


comprehensive enough to evaluate various operations effectively.


The suggested the KPIs such as product development accuracy,


scheduled production, timely target completion, and timely machinery


maintenance within the category of operations related KPIs are out-


lined inTable 1.


2.4.3 | Quality-related KPIs


The determination of, and improvement in, quality are the constant


endeavors of manufacturing organizations. Typically, organizations


MOKTADIR ET AL. 3335


















target quality because of their commitments to their patrons of prod-


ucts and operations (Heckl, Moormann, & Rosemann, 2010). As such,


organizations are always in search of measures to examine and


enhance their quality and are always ready to adopt the practices and


methods essential for quality improvements in their operations and


products. Customer satisfaction, less number of defective products,


and total quality management facility are the KPIs within the category


of quality-related KPIs as suggested by the expert's, reflected in


Table 1.


2.4.4 | Economic KPIs


Economic KPIs embody the varying aspects of an organization that


must be considered to stay competitive in their profession for the


long term (Baumgartner & Ebner, 2010). These KPIs reflect the con-


cerns of an organization about its economic structure, both on the


national and international levels. This aspect of KPIs incorporates a


set of standards to appraise the value generated by an organization


and its collaborators. The recommended KPIs such as return on


investment, revenue growth rate, net profit, and customer-based prof-


itability within the category of economic KPIs are listed inTable 1.


2.4.5 | Social KPIs


Social KPIs are concerned with the effects of the social system on the


organizations that operate within them. This dimension of KPIs aims


to direct interactions between collaborators decisively, both in the


present and in the future (Rodrigues, Pigosso, & McAloone, 2016).

2.4.6 | Environmental KPIs


Environmental KPIs determine the efficiency of an organization in


attaining its broader goals and targets while still achieving environ-


mental goals. The information accumulated by organizations related


to the environment must be utilized to the utmost extent (Boakye,


TIngbani, Ahinful, Damoah, & Tauringana, 2020). Environmental KPIs


must meet the binary goals of facilitating the organization and, at the


same time, transfer the relevant information to its partners. Therefore,


environmental KPIs should be relevant to the size of the organization


and its requirements. The KPIs such as environmental management


system, greenhouse gas emission rate, and emission to water and land


under the category of environmental KPIs are outlined inTable 1.


3 | METHODOLOGY


3.1 | Research design


In this study, initially, a set of KPIs for operational excellence in the


background of the leather products industry are identified through lit-


erature review and expert's suggestions, as reflected in Table 4. After


that, using BWM, the weight of each identified KPIs is determined to


examine the performance of each case company. Using those weights


and ratings, we find out the performance of the case companies and


rate them accordingly. This would ultimately result in determining


how KPI index set to know the operations excellence of the case

The BWM was developed by Professor Jafar Rezaei in 2015 to


explain complications in MCDM (Rezaei, 2015). The BWM method is


gaining popularity in several disciplines due to its salient features com-


pared with other MCDM techniques (Chowdhury & Paul, 2020). First,


BWM needs less effort and time compared with other MCDM tech-


niques such as AHP, ANP, and fuzzy AHP due to requiring less


pairwise comparison vector (Mi et al., 2019). Second, results produced


by BWM are more consistent and reliable than the other MCDM


techniques (Rezaei, 2016). Third, BWM is recognized by the


researchers and practitioners as a simple MCDM approach that can


quickly assess the complex decision-making problem (Salimi &


Rezaei, 2018). This method has already been practiced in various real-


world problems. For example, Suhi et al. (2019) employed the BWM


for the assessment of environmental criteria for SSCs, Moktadir, Ali,


Jabbour, et al., (2019) used the BWM to evaluate the key factors of


energy efficiency in the leather industry, Malek and Desai (2019)


applied the BWM to assess barriers to sustainable manufacturing


practices, and Munny et al. (2019) utilized BWM to evaluate enablers


of social sustainability in the footwear industry. The rating scale used


in BWM analysis is shown inTable 2.


The stepwise procedure of the BWM (Rezaei, 2015) is given as


follows.


Step 1: Identify a set of KPIs {KPI1, KPI2, …, KPIn} to reach a decision.


Step 2: The respondent determines the best and worst KPIs and sub-


KPIs without any comparison.


Step 3: Decision makers rate the best KPI over all the other KPIs using


a 1–9 scale rating value. This is similarly applicable for all other sub-


KPIs. The vector of KPIs and sub-KPIs would be as follows:


AB = AB1,AB2,…,ABnð Þ,


where aBj denotes the preference of the best KPI B over KPI j. It can


be concluded that the value of aBB would be 1.


Step 4: Decision makers rate all the KPIs over the worst KPI using


a 1–9 scale rating value, as for all other sub-KPIs. The vector of


others-to-worst KPIs and sub-KPIs would be as follows:


Aw = A1w,A2w,…,Anwð Þ,


where Ajw denotes the preference of KPI j over the worst KPI w. The


value of aww would be 1.


Step 5: The weights of (w1
*, w2


*, …,wn
*) are calculated.


The final weights of each KPI and sub-KPI are where, for each


group of wB/wj and wj/ww, we have wB/wj = aBj and wj/ww = ajw. To ful-


fill these conditions for all j, we need to search the optimal solution


where the maximum absolute differences |wB/wj ― aBj| and |wj/ww ―


ajw| for all j are minimized. Finally, the nonlinear optimixation model


can be formed as follows:


wB−aBjw j
!! !! w j−ajWwW


!! !!" #,


min max {|wB − aBjwj|,|wj − ajWwW|},

To determine the optimal weights of (w#1,w

nÞ for each KPI and


sub-KPI and the optimal value of ξL, Model 2 needs to be solved. For


better consistency (ξL) of KPIs comparisons, a result close to “0” is


desired.


After determination of the weights of the main KPIs and sub-KPIs


from the BWM analysis, the final weight or global weight for individ-


ual KPIs is acquired by multiplying the major KPIs weights with their


respective weight of sub-KPIs. The global weight is used further for


performance determination. The KPI ratings of several companies are


then collected based on the 1–9 rating scale to try and enhance the


performance of each of the companies. Finally, the overall perfor-


mance indexes of the case companies are calculated by the following


equation:


Vi =
Xn


j=1


w jpij, ð3Þ


where wj is the weight of sub-KPI j, which is obtained from the BWM


analysis, and pij is the preference rating of the case company i over


sub-KPI j.


4 | THE CASE APPLICATION


The proposed method was practiced in real-life case from the leather


products industry in emerging economies. In this study, the leather


products industry was highlighted to investigate the KPIs due to its


remarkable contribution to the growth of the country's economy as


well as its need for operational excellence in its manufacturing sys-


tems. To be more sustainable in their manufacturing activities, it is


imperative to understand the actual performance that will further sup-


port the improvement of operational performance. To achieve the


desired research goals, initially, the 19 KPIs were identified consider-


ing the scientific articles from the scholarly databases, that is, Google


Scholar, ScienceDirect, and Scopus. After that, to validate, finalize,


and assess the KPIs, the expert's were invited in multiple stages of


data collection using a purposive sampling technique. In this non-


probability sampling technique, respondents are chosen selective way.


In the first stage of data collection, we invited 25 industrial and five


academic professionals via email communication along with the list of


identified 19 KPIs collected from different scientific articles. In the


first stage of data collection, we have received a total of seven


responses; six from the six case companies and one from an academic


professional. The six case companies were the reputed leather prod-


ucts industry of Bangladesh, and they are producing and exporting


high-quality leather goods (i.e., leather bags, wallets, belts, passport


cases, ladies purses, credit card cases etc.). The six respondents are


working in the area of production, merchandising, and the research


and development department in the respective industry. They have a


keen interest in the research topic and showed interest in participat-


ing in the next stages of data collection. Accordingly, one professional


expert from the institution domain responded to participate in the ini-


tial stage as well as the next stages of data collection. The particulars


of the respondents are given below inTable 3.


The application of the proposed method is separated into the


three phases described as follows.


4.1 | Phase-1: Finalization of KPIs by expert's
feedback


In this phase, the relevant KPIs are finalized with the help of expert's


feedback. In the first stage of data collection, we received eight new


KPIs from the seven respondents. Further, in the second stage of data


collection, we have communicated and arranged face-to-face

meetings to categorize the finalized KPIs, and only the relevant KPIs


in the background of emerging economies were considered for further


evaluation process. Finally, with the expert's feedback, the identified


KPIs were categorized under the six potential KPIs divisions, that is,


management, operations, quality, economic, social, and environmental.


The identified and finalized 27 sub-KPIs under the six potential KPIs


divisions are listed inTable 4.


4.2 | Phase-2: Assessment of identified KPIs and
sub-KPIs


In this phase, the assessment process of KPIs and sub-KPIs is broadly


described.


4.2.1 | Determination of the best and worst KPIs
and sub-KPIs


In the third phase of face-to-face data collection, each of the seven


expert's was approached to determine the best and worst KPIs and


sub-KPIs from each of the six questionnaires (presented in the


Supporting information) provided to them. Finally, the determined


best and worst KPIs and sub-KPIs are given inTable 5.


4.2.2 | Determination of the best KPI and sub-KPIs
over all the other KPIs and sub-KPIs


In this step, the experts constructed the vectors for the best KPI over


other KPIs, exercising the 1–9 point rating scale. The best or most

4.2.3 | Determination of the other KPIs and sub-
KPIs over the worst KPI and sub-KPI


In this step, the experts were invited to signify their preference of the


remaining KPIs over the worst KPI using the 1–9 point rating system.


In this context, the feedback of Expert 1 (E1) is presented below in


Table 8. The responses from Experts 2–7 are given in the Supporting


information.


Similarly, the identified sub-KPIs over the worst sub-KPI for


Expert 1(E1) are given in Table 9. Those for Experts 2–7 are given in


the Supporting information.


4.2.4 | Determination of the optimal weights of the
KPIs and sub-KPIs


In this step, the optimal weights of individual KPIs and sub-KPIs were


processed by satisfying the mentioned model and constrictions (see


Equation 2) in the previous section for Expert 1 (E1). For KPIs, an


example of the model for Expert 1 is reflected below:

The above-mentioned linear programming models are solved in


the Excel Solver. The optimal weights for the objective function, KPIs,


and the sub-KPIs for Expert 1 were then computed and are presented


inTable 10.


Similarly, other models for KPIs and sub-KPIs were constructed


for Expert's 2–7 (E2–E7), and the optimal weights were computed


using Excel Solver. After that, the final average weight of each KPI


and sub-KPI was computed by using a simple averaging technique


(we used arithmetic mean). The average weights of KPIs and sub-KPIs


and the global weights of sub-KPIs are presented below in Table 11.


Multiplying the weight of the KPIs with their respective sub-KPIs, the


global weights of sub-KPIs were computed.


4.3 | Phase-3: Evaluation of the performance
indexes of case companies


In this phase, the performance index of case companies was calcu-


lated with the assistance of expert's feedback from respective


fields using the Equation 3. In this study, we adopted the following


threshold values for marking the case companies to categorize their


performances motivated from the previous study Elhuni and


Ahmad (2017). The performance levels were categorized as


follows:


If the score belongs to 1 ≤ scores ≤3, then the company's perfor-


mance level is poor.


If the score belongs to 3 < scores ≤7, then the company's perfor-


mance level is fair.


If the score belongs to 7 < scores ≤9, then the company's perfor-


mance level is good.


If the score belongs to scores >9 then the company's perfor-


mance level is excellent.


Therefore, the data were collected again from the domain experts


based on their working experiences providing the rating scale to rate


the performance against each sub-KPI. A rating of 1 stands for the


lowest performance, and 10 stands for an excellent performance. In


this study, we evaluated the performance of four case companies


based on the 27 listed sub-KPIs. The case companies were


X1 stands for case Company 1.


X4 stands for case Company 4.


X5 stands for case Company 5.


X7 stands for case Company 7.


The ratings of each company against each sub-KPI are listed


below in Table 12, which was constructed with the assistance of pre-


viously purposively selected experts (E1, E4, E5, and E7) from the case


companies (X1, X4, X5, and X7). In the performance evaluation, we


have considered four case companies as they have high potentiality


and decision makers are more experienced than others.


For each of the case companies, the ratings for different sub-KPIs


were multiplied by their respective global weights and then summed.


The summation result provided the performance index of the respec-


tive company.


Using Equation 3 the global weights obtained from Table 11


multiply with the performance rating presented below in Table 12,


the performance index of company X1 was calculated as


VX1 = 6.5330.


Similarly, we determined the performance indexes of the rest of


the companies.


The performance index of X4 (VX4) is 6.6140.


The performance index of X5 (VX5) is 7.5147.


The performance index of X7 (VX7) is 4.5875.

5 | RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS


In this section, the results achieved from the BWM are discussed


broadly with a practical point of view. Further, the performances of


the case companies with respect to KPIs are discussed.


5.1 | Discussions on KPIs ranking


The findings of the study are reflected above in Table 11. In the initial


stage of BWM analysis, “Management (KPI1)” received the highest


weightage (0.3677), indicating its importance in achieving operational


excellence in the leather products industry. Skilled management teams


can help advance operational performance in the leather products


industry. Also, in the leather products industry, the quality of the


products as well as performances largely depends on skilled manage-


ment (Lindberg et al., 2015). Therefore, management-related KPIs


were prioritized the highest by the industry experts. When

management plays its role effectively, all the other KPIs remain under


control and run accordingly (Ferreira, Shamsuzzoha, Toscano, &


Cunha, 2012).


In the category of “Management” related KPI, five sub-KPIs were


analyzed for their influence on each KPI in the leather products indus-


try. These five sub-KPIs were “time gap between buyer approach and


order placement (KPI11),” “efficient inventory management facility


(KPI12),” “skilled management facility of capacity utilization (KPI13),”


“product marketing management facility (KPI14),” and “management


facility of the production monitoring system (KPI15),” and they were


ranked seventh, third, first, fourth, and second, respectively, in the


final ranking. The results indicated that “skilled management facility of


capacity utilization” was the crucial sub-KPI for achieving operational


excellence in the leather products industry. Better utilization of


resources in an organization emerges as a key performance indicator


for the manufacturing industries (Bhatti et al., 2014). Hence, the sub-


KPI “skilled management facility of capacity utilization” is a very


crucial KPI for the leather products industry to improve operational


performance. Next, under the category of management KPI, “manage-


ment facility of production monitoring system” ranked second in the


evaluation process, indicating that a well-established management


facility of the production monitoring system can help to achieve a bet-


ter performing production process. In the assessment, an “efficient


inventory management facility” was ranked third. The effective man-


agement of inventory systems is essential for enhancing business per-


formance as inventory management frequently narrates a significant


share of SCM costs and improves service levels (Yang, Pan, &


Ballot, 2017). Therefore, a highly efficient leather products industry


should have a good inventory management system. “Products market-


ing management facility” was at the fourth position in the final KPI


ranking, confirming its importance in attaining operational excellence.


Lastly, the sub-KPI “time gap between buyer approach and order


placement” ranked seventh. With most of the industries functioning


on a just-in-time basis, there is less space for error in the delivery

process (Chan, Chung, & Wadhwa, 2004). Better time management


with buyer approach and order placement may perform as important


KPI for the leather products industry.


The next highest-ranked KPI was “operations (KPI2)” with a


weight of 0.1880. Thus, after attaining effective management, the


next priority should be given to operations throughout a factory as


the overall performance of an industry largely depends on the effi-


cient operations of the production systems. Manufacturing firms often


try to improve their operational efficiency for the overall improve-


ment of the firms' performance (Badawy, El-Aziz, Idress, Hefny, &


Hossam, 2016). In the leather products industry, many operations-


related KPIs could be helped by better knowledge of the actual opera-


tional performance. The operations KPI contains different sub-KPIs


based on the running of the entire production floor. In this category,


five sub-KPIs were assessed for their performance index. In the pri-


mary analysis, “scheduled production (order fulfillment cycle time)”


was in the eighth position of the BWM analysis. Scheduling is linked


with decisions built when the production process is under operation,


while planning is associated with decisions made before the


production process initiates (Nakamura & Salvendy, 1994). In the


leather products industry, scheduled production is an imperative sub-


KPI for operational performance.


Next, the sub-KPI “product development accuracy” came ninth in


the final ranking. Product development has become a potential strategic


activity in many industries as a new product creates an escalating signif-


icant contribution to sales and profits (Koufteros, Vonderembse, &


Jayaram, 2005). This indicates that accuracy in product development in


the leather products industry is crucially important KPI. The sub-KPI


“timely target completion” was ranked the tenth position in the global


rank. Production achievement is measured in terms of attaining the


objectives and fulfilling it on time (Haque et al., 2011). This KPI specifies


that the timely completion of production with a target quantity could


be an important factor for achieving operational excellence in the indus-


try. The “accuracy in sewing operation” and “timely machinery mainte-


nance” came 14th and 20th in the global ranking. It is important to have


accuracy in sewing operations for the manufacturing of quality prod-


ucts; otherwise, it can impact on the performance of the companies.


Accordingly, robust machinery maintenance is urgently necessary for

the leather goods manufacturing industry, which can regulate the main-


tenance costs at the ground level and conserve the overall equipment


effectiveness at the highest level (Tu, Yam, Tse, & Sun, 2001). For oper-


ation, “scheduled production” is the most important KPI in the category


of operations KPI, whereas timely machinery maintenance was ranked


toward the bottom. However, it does not mean maintenance is not


important because without machinery maintenance, production will be


hampered. For operational excellence, both KPIs can contribute


significantly.


Next, the KPI “Economic” received the third position in the final


ranking, carrying a weight of 0.1683. This KPI is naturally important


for the leather products industry as operational excellence signifi-


cantly depends on economic KPIs. In this category, five sub-KPIs were


considered to guide the operational excellence of the leather products


industry. The analysis revealed that the KPI “return on investment


(ROI)” ranked highest in this category and received the fifth position


in the final rank, whereas the sub-KPI “customer-based profitability”


was ranked the lowest under this category and nineteenth in the final


ranking. “Return on investment,” the main KPI under the economy


heading, is achieved only when capacity is fully utilized with a lesser


number of rejected outputs (Demydyuk, 2012). The KPI “net profit” is


ultimately the main concern regarding profit and loss. But almost as


important is revenue growth, which is only sustainable when a comp-


any's motto is to grow with time. Customer-based profitability is an


important sub-KPI as the services and products are sold by the organi-


zations with scant knowledge, disturbing the customers who pur-


chased the products earlier. A transformation from this product-


centered to a customer-centered environment is visible in the current


environment (Coussement & Van den Poel, 2008). Customer-based


profit should probably be included within net profit as net profit plays


an inherent part in the economic functioning of the organization


(Elzahar, Hussainey, Mazzi, & Tsalavoutas, 2015). “Penalty achieve-


ment rate” was rated a little lower because if the other KPIs are priori-


tized, then penalties can generally be avoided.


Next is the KPI “Quality” got the fourth position in the ranking and


confirmed that without quality, a company's reputation is hindered in


the market, ultimately affecting all the economic factors. Under the


quality KPI, “customer satisfaction” is the leading KPI because the cus-


tomers' standards guide the quality standard. In the present competitive


business environment, customer satisfaction is a progressively signifi-


cant element of an efficient organization (Fornell, Mithas, Morgeson, &


Krishnan, 2006). In order to satisfy customers, a TQM facility should be


maintained within the industry. TQM has become an essential manage-


ment philosophy adopted for enhancing the quality and productivity of


the organizations (Karia & Asaari, 2006). The KPI “Total Quality Man-


agement (TQM) facility” was ranked 11th. Ensuring these KPIs adhere


that would lead to lesser customer complaints. Therefore, the KPI “cus-


tomer complaints rate” received less priority in the rank. Finally, this


would result in a lesser number of rejected defective products. It would


seem that quality-related KPIs are more significant for the performance


improvement of a company.


The environmental KPI was regarded slightly higher than the


social KPI, but not by much. In many factories, they are major


concerns because the surroundings must not be affected by the


industry. Also, both environmental and social KPIs are key points for


satisfying compliance. Thus, if all of the higher ranked KPIs run cor-


rectly, the lower ones are automatically taken care of (Bean &


Geraghty, 2003). Sustainability and sustainable implementation in


businesses can be described as an amalgamation of environmental,


social, and economic performance. Therefore, it becomes important


for businesses to understand the KPIs to be employed to quantify the


environmental, economic, and social aspects (Kocmanová &


Dočekalová, 2014).


Environmental and social KPIs are principle points of compliance


for industry, and these days, compliance has become a vital issue


(Rabhi, 2011). Although these KPIs might come lower down in regard


to productivity improvement, they do affect the industry in the long


run. In the leather products industry, solid waste is a serious concern.


The leather products industry generates an enormous amount of solid


wastes far exceeding the quantum of finished goods. It must be dis-


posed of properly so as not to affect the surrounding environment. A


major focus of any “environmental management system” is the proper


management of solid waste. While being ranked the lowest, social


KPIs are still a vital issue. The most significant sub-KPI of social KPI is


“employee satisfaction.” Employee satisfaction refers to a person's


evaluation of the overall quality of his current mission (Jung &


Yoon, 2015). Employees who are convinced that their jobs are closely


related to improved profit margins and enhanced productivity (Al-


Refaie, 2015).


Further, satisfied employees dedicate their full potential for the


sake of the company. Workers' safety is also important to keep


employees protected from any adverse effects of the industry. Pro-


moting worthy occupational safety practices to workers in the leather


products industry results in various advantages, such as enhance-


ments in productivity, lower costs, and increases in organizational


capability (Tafere, Beyera, & Wami, 2019). When both the above KPIs


are managed effectively, “staff advocacy rate” automatically increases.


Lastly, “maternal facility” does not need any separate priority because


it would be managed under “workers' safety” and “employee satisfac-


tion” (Shamsaei, Pourshahid, & Amyot, 2010).


5.2 | Discussions on the performance index of case
companies


After the assessment of KPIs, we performed some case investigations


for four leather products companies, using the identified KPIs. This


analysis revealed that the case company “X5” had the highest perfor-


mance score of 7.5147, being within the index value rated “good per-


formance level.” Next, the performance of case companies X1 and X3
were valued as “fair performance level” with performance indexes of


6.5330 and 6.6140, respectively. Although companies X1 and X3 have


gone through some ups and downs in recent times, they focused on


achieving a perfect industrial environment throughout the premises,


which further boosted their performance in a short time, even quicker


than X5. Lastly, company X7 received the lowest performance index of

4.5875. Being a small and young company, it struggles to keep its


head within the competition. However, they work hard to build their


foundation, offering both local and export orders to progress their


commitment to quality gradually.


6 | CONCLUSIONS, IMPLICATIONS,
RECOMMENDATIONS AND FUTURE SCOPE


Business organizations are finding it difficult to accomplish opera-


tional excellence within their supply chains. However, manufacturing


firms in the emerging economies context are trying to achieve opera-


tional excellence by being sustainable in the world market. Therefore,


only recent business trends reflect the performance of organizations


in attaining operational excellence in manufacturing firms. To assist


manufacturing firms in achieving operational excellence, they must


develop a framework. In this study, such a framework for assessing


operational excellence in the leather products industry was proposed


using a BWM. A list of 27 KPIs were identified from a literature sur-


vey and using feedback of expert's from the case companies. Finally,


an assessment model was developed using BWM to assess the indi-


vidual KPIs and investigate their performance indexes, which helped


further to comprehend the current functioning of these case compa-


nies. The findings revealed that “Management” KPI received the


highest priority, followed by operations, economic, quality, environ-


mental, and social. When management is strong and disciplined, every


other aspect remains under control. To advance the operational excel-


lence of the leather products industry, management must play the key


role for full capacity utilization, with complete accuracy in product


development, satisfying customers by giving them what they need,


keeping in mind what returns are achieved for the investments made,


ensuring an effective waste management system, and always prioritiz-


ing employees' needs and satisfaction (Lindberg et al., 2015).


The analysis also revealed the following priority order of KPIs:


skilled management facility of capacity utilization > management facil-


ity of production monitoring system > efficient inventory manage-


ment system facility > product marketing management


facility > return on investment (ROI) > customer satisfaction > time


gap between buyer approach and order placement > scheduled pro-


duction (order fulfillment cycle time).


Further, in this study, we examined the case companies' opera-


tional performance to develop a policy for sustainable development of


the leather products industry. The following implications may assist


the leather products industry in advancing their operational


performance:


a. Maximize capacity utilization through skilled management team: For


operational excellence, manufacturing firms need a skilled manage-


ment team to use the capacity to its highest level. Proper utiliza-


tion of resources can help achieve the sustainability of supply


chains as well as profit maximization. Therefore, leather products


manufacturing firms need to develop proper facilities or program-


mable tools to maximize the utilization of resources.


b. Proper management facility of production monitoring system: Indus-


try decision makers need to think about the production monitoring


system for achieving operational excellence. There is no reliable


mechanism available to allow continuous monitoring of all process


conditions and quality of leather products (i.e., leather bags, wallet,


jacket, and ladies' purse) manufacturing (Guţ{t\hskip-0.7ex\char


"B8}"a & Dumitrache, 2015). A robust IT framework can assist


leather products industry to monitor their real-time production.


Therefore, decision makers and the IT department need to work


together to develop better production monitoring systems that


could enhance the performance of the Bangladeshi leather prod-


ucts industry.


c. Develop efficient inventory management system: Real-time monitor-


ing systems must be developed for efficient inventory manage-


ment in order to achieve a good performance score, indicating


operational excellence for their production systems. Therefore,


managers of the leather products industry must need to develop a


better inventory management system considering various types of


inventory control models like production order quantity, economic


order quantity, and probabilistic models.


d. Strong product marketing management facility: A strong marketing


management facility can help to achieve the goals of the supply


chain. Hence, decision makers should pay excess attention to


product marketing management facilities to enhance the perfor-


mance of the leather products industry. Therefore, they may


develop some business strategies to enhance the performance of


the industry.


e. Maximize the return on investment (ROI): Both profit margins and


better quality are important issues for operational excellence and


sustainability of the leather products industry. Decision makers


should establish well-structured supply chain networks for maxi-


mizing the ROI.


f. Better customer satisfaction: Customer satisfaction is an essential


element to success for business organizations. Without considering


quality products, a leather product manufacturing firm cannot


achieve operational excellence. Therefore, better customer satis-


faction can help the leather products industry by providing quality


products to the end consumers.


This study provides a pathway to use KPIs to attain operational


excellence in the manufacturing industry, but mainly for the leather


products industry. However, this study does have some limitations. It


did not consider the supply chain 4.0 aspects, a key tool for achieving


operational excellence in the industry. In the future, an interrogation


of KPIs and supply chain 4.0 could be assessed with statistical valida-


tion. Further, an integrated dynamic tool could be established to


assess the KPIs and the performance indexes of industry supply


chains. The present study could be improved by including more KPIs


by organizing a large-scale survey of manufacturing industries.
