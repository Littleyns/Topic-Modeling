Abstract 


In today’s business environment, the trend towards more product variety and customization is unbroken. Due to this development, the need of 
agile and reconfigurable production systems emerged to cope with various products and product families. To design and optimize production
systems as well as to choose the optimal product matches, product analysis methods are needed. Indeed, most of the known methods aim to 
analyze a product or one product family on the physical level. Different product families, however, may differ largely in terms of the number and 
nature of components. This fact impedes an efficient comparison and choice of appropriate product family combinations for the production
system. A new methodology is proposed to analyze existing products in view of their functional and physical architecture. The aim is to cluster
these products in new assembly oriented product families for the optimization of existing assembly lines and the creation of future reconfigurable 
assembly systems. Based on Datum Flow Chain, the physical structure of the products is analyzed. Functional subassemblies are identified, and 
a functional analysis is performed. Moreover, a hybrid functional and physical architecture graph (HyFPAG) is the output which depicts the 
similarity between product families by providing design support to both, production system planners and product designers. An illustrative
example of a nail-clipper is used to explain the proposed methodology. An industrial case study on two product families of steering columns of 
thyssenkrupp Presta France is then carried out to give a first industrial evaluation of the proposed approach.

1. Introduction 


Due to the fast development in the domain of 
communication and an ongoing trend of digitization and
digitalization, manufacturing enterprises are facing important
challenges in today’s market environments: a continuing
tendency towards reduction of product development times and
shortened product lifecycles. In addition, there is an increasing
demand of customization, being at the same time in a global 
competition with competitors all over the world. This trend, 
which is inducing the development from macro to micro 
markets, results in diminished lot sizes due to augmenting
product varieties (high-volume to low-volume production) [1]. 
To cope with this augmenting variety as well as to be able to
identify possible optimization potentials in the existing
production system, it is important to have a precise knowledge


of the product range and characteristics manufactured and/or 
assembled in this system. In this context, the main challenge in
modelling and analysis is now not only to cope with single 
products, a limited product range or existing product families,
but also to be able to analyze and to compare products to define
new product families. It can be observed that classical existing
product families are regrouped in function of clients or features.
However, assembly oriented product families are hardly to find. 


On the product family level, products differ mainly in two
main characteristics: (i) the number of components and (ii) the
type of components (e.g. mechanical, electrical, electronical). 


Classical methodologies considering mainly single products 
or solitary, already existing product families analyze the
product structure on a physical level (components level) which 
causes difficulties regarding an efficient definition and
comparison of different product families. Addressing this

Abstract 


The number of cyber-attacks on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is constantly increasing. SMEs do not recognize the attacks until the 
damage has occurred. Only then, they fight with measures to increase IT-security and IT-safety. Many studies come to the point that this refers 
to a lack of budget, expertise and awareness of the need for IT-security. There are many compendia with recommendations for action, but they 
are too comprehensive and unspecific to the individual needs of SMEs. In this paper, we present the results of a research activity on the gaps that 
address the challenges faced by SMEs. In addition, we develop a concept for a serious gaming approach that includes an economic perspective 
on IT-security measures and shows how SMEs can derive their own IT-security target state.

1. Introduction 


The continuously widening gap between expert knowledge 
and laypersons, especially with regard to growing IT-security 
requirements, induced by the far-reaching trends of 
digitalization, is creating new challenges. These challenges 
range from the handling of personal data in the private 
environment to so-called cyber-physical systems in the 
industrial context, which are vulnerable to an equally 
increasing number of attackers. Due to the networking within 
the framework of Industry 4.0 and the convergence of 
Information Technology (IT) and Operational Technology 
(OT), which is also known as shopfloor IT, a company offers 
attackers a growing attack surface. [1] 


According to public figures, 53% of SMEs worldwide were 
or are affected by cyber-attacks [2]. Numerous sources assume 
that the dark figure is significantly higher. The Federal Office 
for Security and Information Technology of Germany (BSI) 
classifies the risk situation as high in 2018 based on external 
factors and the state of the art in SMEs [3]. 


However, an economic evaluation of security measures 
against these attacks or potential attacks is not available yet, so 


that the information required for strategic developments is 
neither valid nor meaningful. In order to be able to carry out 
the evaluation, knowledge about the situational behavior of 
companies in the face of various IT-security scenarios must be 
collected and selected measures must be evaluated in terms of 
their effectiveness and economic efficiency. This enables an 
sustainable implementation of IT-security for SMEs.  


To achieve this goal, a research project will develop a 
serious gaming environment as well as a simulation platform 
embedded in a workshop concept and use it to obtain valid data 
from the behavior of the participants for the quantitative 
economic evaluation of IT-security measures. 


2. Background 


The majority of SMEs do not have an IT-security officer and 
often the related tasks are performed on a part-time basis and 
together with other tasks [4]. At the same time, however, 
‘hacker attacks’ in 2019, at 43%, are the greatest subjective risk 
for companies [5]. SMEs are often either unaware that 
information respectively IT-security can be decisive for the 
existence of the company, or they simply lack the expertise and

together with other tasks [4]. At the same time, however, 
‘hacker attacks’ in 2019, at 43%, are the greatest subjective risk

of research. Business games or serious games are becoming 
more and more widespread as a professional method, while at 
the same time the number of efforts to determine the economic 
impact of IT-security is increasing. By combining these two 
research elements, the goal of economic evaluation of IT-
security can be achieved.


3. Research Methodology


To achieve this goal, a two-year research project is planned 
in which the tasks listed below must be completed. This will be 
done in cooperation between RWTH Aachen University and 
the University of Applied Sciences of Aachen in close 
collaboration with associations and its member companies 
from industry. The tasks are:


1. Development of a rough concept [12] of the serious game
environment (including storybook, interaction with the
players, who will be involved, etc.) based on different
requirements, which are determined by the consortium
within the project, considering different target groups. This
ensures that the serious game environment can be
developed in a goal-oriented manner,


2. Description and structuring of relevant IT-security
measures based on a hierarchical approach and
supplementation with typical attack vectors,


3. Evaluation of the identified IT-security measures with
regard to their economic characteristics in order to enable a
realistic modelling,


4. Provision of a serious game environment as minimum
viable product, into which all results from earlier septs in
the project can be integrated. At the same time, an iterative
‘further development by design’ is ensured.


The overall aim of the research project is to develop a 
serious game environment and a simulation platform in form of 
a software application to enable companies to deal 
independently with IT-security in relation to their specific 
situation and to evaluate IT-security measures economically. 
To achieve that, we pursue the following three sub-goals:


 Determination of the actual and target state of the IT-
security level under economic aspects of IT-security,


 Integration of an IT-security assessment into business
processes,


 Sensitization for dealing with IT-security.


In addition to that, the serious game environment is 
developed iteratively. It can be ensured that the requirements 
set is met at an early stage. The associated companies and 
groups of interests play a special role. Due to the possibility of 
repeatedly relying on a large number of companies, the external 
validity and applicability of the serious game environment is 
ensured. The internal validity is guaranteed by the serious game 
concept to be considered as the most suitable.


4. Concept and logic


The concept consists of four elements: modelling of the 
company, derivation of the attack vectors, defense and 
evaluation of the attacks, debriefing of the actions. The content 
of the elements is described below (Fig. 2.)


4.1 Modelling the company 


4.1.1 Structural elements 


Within the modelling of the company, all relevant
structure elements of an enterprise must be represented in 
an abstract form, which have an influence on potential 
attack vectors. Currently, eight categories or layers are 
provided within the modelling (see Fig. 3.): 


 General company information
 Physical elements (e.g. machines)
 IoT devices
 Communication
 Gateways
 Networks
 Cloud
 Usage (People)


To ensure an environment in which a wide range of 
companies are comparable, it is important to address general 
information about the company that takes part in the serious 
game. This information includes size of the company, its 
number of employees and so on. 


The physical layer represents the first category that needs to 
be addressed within the serious game. This category contains 
mainly components, devices and sensors that are difficult to 
protect against physical access on the shopfloor. Furthermore, 
it describes components such as facilities and office areas. On 
this level, information can be gathered by a physical access to 
information systems. As a high number of cyber-attacks have 
their origin within the attacked company itself, it is an 
important aspect. 


IoT-devices represent the second category. The increasing 
number of IoT-devices within manufacturing companies as
well as in our daily life leads to different challenges. The small 
and cheap devices are produced without any security by design 
methodology and have a lack of implementation opportunities 
due to their restricted hardware capacity. They often allow 
direct access from the internet. Before applying IoT-devices to

budget to select and implement the relevant technical, 
organizational and cultural measures, or even to know their 
interrelationships [6]. According to the German Insurance 
Association, successfully attacked SMEs had to shut down 
their operations completely in 43% of cases. Thus shows that 
the IT-security is a critical corporate function.  


In companies, the necessity of the profitability of projects is 
measured by the ROI (Return on Invest). This shows whether 
an investment is worthwhile or not. The return on investment 
of IT-security measures is hard to determine, since the costs of 
a cyber-security incident is difficult to quantify [7]. The topic 
of return on security investment (ROSI) or the economic 
consideration of IT-security measures is therefore currently a 
subject of intense discussion in research and industry.

In the research area of IT-security, several projects were 


carried out with the aim of improving IT-security considering 
the economical perspective of IT-security measures (Fig. 1.). 
An explicit example is the project SIDATE. Within the project 
tools and concepts were developed, which allow a better 
assessment of the existing security level and thus help to 
improve the security of the infrastructures of small and 
medium-sized manufacturing companies. The focus is on the 
applicability and practicability, which can also be used by 
operators with special economic, organizational and personnel 
requirements. Within this project, the economic consideration 
of IT-security measures was partly considered. In other projects 


with a focus on raising awareness of possible cyber-attacks, 
elements of serious gaming were frequently used. In these 
projects, however, no economic consideration of IT-security 
measures were included.  


Serious games are defined as games that use computer 
technologies as well as advanced graphic elements and have as 
their goal the learning or training of employees. In many 
contexts, serious games are also referred to as digital learning 
games, game-based learning, business games, applied games, 
educational games and edutainment games [9]. 


An example of a serious game is developed by the Center 
for Cybersecurity and Cyber Operations of the Naval 
Postgraduate School of the US Armed Forces: CyberCIEGE 
represents the broad mass of serious games on the topic of IT-
security. It was developed to convey network security concepts 
and to increase awareness. It is used by US government 
agencies, universities and community colleges as a training 
tool. The serious games available on the market pursue partly 
different goals. From ‘secure on the internet’ [10] to increase 
user sensitivity, to ‘back-doors and breaches’ [11] to teach 
specific IT-security measures, to company-specific cyber ranks 
in which employees are to be trained on IT-security topics. 


It turns out that the topic of the economic consideration of 
IT-security measures has not been examined with an approach 
from the field of serious gaming (see Fig.1.). Thus, there is a 
research gap in the combination of a serious game with an 
economic evaluation of IT-security measures. The novelty of 
this approach is to combine the economic evaluation of IT-
security with a serious game approach. Both elements are not 
new in themselves, even though they are currently the subject

Respectively the implementation of Industrie 4.0 is possible 
from a top-down approach with the levels of the Maturity 
Index. The Industrie 4.0 Maturity Index is a guideline that 
enables the derivation of an individual implementation strategy 
for Industrie 4.0. As a result of an acatech study carried out in 
2017 by an interdisciplinary consortium of research institutions 
and industrial partners, it helps companies to manage their 
digital transformation [14]. The Maturity Index considers four 
different dimensions: resources (workforce, machinery and 
equipment), information systems, culture and organizational 
structure (see Fig. 4.). As it is shown in the figure, the Maturity 
Index is based on six discrete, consecutive and benefit-oriented 
maturity levels. Each of these maturity levels possesses 
different potential attack vectors and therefore related IT-
security measures. However, in detailing the concept, it must 
be ensured that there are intersections between the described 
levels and the eight categories described above.


Bottom-up it is possible to implement explicit Industrie 4.0 
use cases inside the serious gaming environment. This enables 
companies to determine which use cases have an impact on the 
risk level and which IT-security measures are necessary for 
each use case. E.g., a company wants to implement predictive 
maintenance to a tooling machine along with the support of a 
service provider via cloud. In this case, other IT-security 
measures should take place than with an on-premise solution. 
Several of these specified use cases will found the basis for 
further implementation and work. 


The top-down approach addresses aspects of the overall 
strategy for a digital transformation, from where implications 
on IT-security can be derived. The bottom-up approach helps 
to identify specific IT-security measures for validated use 
cases. Therefore, both the serious game environment and 
simulation platform will be developed with high reliability.


4.2 Derivation of the attack vectors


The modelling of the company is the basis for an 
individualized determination of the attack vectors. The overall 
aim is to identify an optimal trade-off between the level of 
detail of the modelling and the time required for the modelling. 


Within the project, it must therefore be considered if different
detail levels of the modeling are possible.  


These attack vectors, partially mentioned above (see Fig. 
3.), will be a collection of possible scenarios derived from both 
case study analysis or literature review and expert interviews. 
As the attack vectors are part of continuous change and 
development, it is important to implement an iterative process 
to keep them up to date.


The result will be a longlist of attack vectors, which then 
needs to be clustered in a second step. The eight mentioned 
categories, its specification as well as the complexity and 
possible damage of the attack vectors are dimensions of these 
clustering process. E.g., to build the attacking scenarios, it is 
important to know whether a specific attack vector causes a lot 
of damage or not. By modelling the company and attack 
vectors, the risk exposure can be determined, which determines 
how likely an attack is under given conditions. 


4.3 Defence and evaluation of the attacks


Based on the modeling of the company and the attack 
vectors, a quantitative economic evaluation of the IT-security 
measures can be carried out in the serious gaming environment.
The company now decides whether a specific IT-security 
measure should be implemented to prevent various attacking 
scenarios or not. If a company decides to do so, the benefit and 
therefore the ROSI of the IT-security measures rises. At the 
stage where the company does not want to invest in other
measures, the optimal IT-security level is reached. By 
applying these procedure to a wide range of companies, a 
economic quantification will be enabled due to the high 
number of participants and their behavior in the serious game. 


For this purpose, the participant is provided with possible 
attack scenarios in the serious gaming environment. In essence, 
the participant should determine the monetary effects that a 
'successful failure' would have on his enterprise. In order to 
reduce complexity, a specification of monetary effects should 
be provided at this point if required. This determination of the 
risk mitigated is carried out for all possible attack vectors.


Because of this step, a qualitative evaluation of the risk 
mitigated is carried out depending on the attack vector and the 
company characteristics. With the help of well-known IT-
security solution costs, it is possible to deduce whether the 
appropriate IT-security measure is economically reasonable or 
not. Based on the generated data from the studies, a 
determination of target values for IT-security solution costs is 
possible.


In addition, the participant could select the correct IT-
security measure to defend the given attack vector or to prevent 
its risk mitigation. This step serves primarily to sensitize the 
participant in the subsequent debriefing session to show which 
IT-security measure would be the most appropriate for his 
modelled enterprise. 


4.4 Debriefing of the actions 


The focus of the debriefing session is to present the results 
of the economic evaluation of the IT-security measures applied 
by the participating companies. It is demonstrated whether the 
chosen IT-security measures are economically reasonable for

a specific use case, several attack vectors and risks need to be 
evaluated.


Mapping the communication between devices and 
gateways within an organization is essential for determining 
the attack vectors, since increased communication 
significantly increases the impact of a successful attack. As 
a result, some attack vectors are more likely and 
potentially more critical to the affected company. To model 
the communication, the first step is to consolidate the physical 
devices and gateways into main groups. Afterwards the type 
of communication between these main groups can be 
determined.


Typical attack vectors regarding gateways are old software 
versions and missing updates. Once installed, a continuous 
update and patch management is missing in many companies. 
Besides that, the problems occur in earlier stages of the 
process, too. As companies often do not have the specific 
expertise and third party consultancy mandates are expensive
in long-term, gateways are configured in a wrong and not 
sufficient way at the same time. 


The category networks describes two different types of 
networks. The first type is a typical network within an 
company. Movements within this network can due several 
month before the exploit is triggered. Therefore, network 
segmentation is a possible IT-security measure. The second 
type represents networks which include more than one 
company. Aspects such as a vertical integration in a digital 
supply chain leads to interesting questions, e.g. how to ensure 
the trustworthiness of data being shared in these network. 


Many companies follow the paradigm ‘cloud first’. Even if 
a lot of companies see risks and stick to their on-premise 
solutions, the cloud market increases steadily. By using cloud 
services, companies transfer a lot of effort to the service and 
cloud provider. But there are negative side effects, too. By not 
validating the service provider, the company increases its 
probability of being hacked via the cloud. For hackers it is 
much more lucrative to attack a cloud platform than a single 
company, because accessing the cloud platform ebables 
accessing data from all connected companies with a lower 
effort. Cloud providers therefore offer big scale effects for 
hacker groups. 


The usage of IT-systems such as Office-Suite products, 
ERP-systems or Software-as-a-Service applications in the daily 
operation builds the last but highly important category. People 
build the core element of this category. Especially emails 
became the aim of attackers in the last years, e.g. with spear 
phishing or outlook harvesting attacks. Therefore, it is more 
important than ever to implement a continuously awareness 
and usage training for the employees.   


4.1.2 Focus on SMES 


In order to focus on SMEs, especially in the area of 
manufacturing companies, it is important to focus on 
technologies and the influence of Industry 4.0. To implement 
this focus in the modelling of the company two possible 
approaches, both a top-down and a bottom-up approach, are 
considered. The modelling of the influences of Industrie 4.0

Respectively the implementation of Industrie 4.0 is possible 
from a top-down approach with the levels of the Maturity 
Index. The Industrie 4.0 Maturity Index is a guideline that 
enables the derivation of an individual implementation strategy 
for Industrie 4.0. As a result of an acatech study carried out in 
2017 by an interdisciplinary consortium of research institutions 
and industrial partners, it helps companies to manage their 
digital transformation [14]. The Maturity Index considers four 
different dimensions: resources (workforce, machinery and 
equipment), information systems, culture and organizational 
structure (see Fig. 4.). As it is shown in the figure, the Maturity 
Index is based on six discrete, consecutive and benefit-oriented 
maturity levels. Each of these maturity levels possesses 
different potential attack vectors and therefore related IT-
security measures. However, in detailing the concept, it must 
be ensured that there are intersections between the described 
levels and the eight categories described above.


Bottom-up it is possible to implement explicit Industrie 4.0 
use cases inside the serious gaming environment. This enables 
companies to determine which use cases have an impact on the

the given risk mitigated or not. Besides, if sufficient data is 
available, companies can access to comparisons on how similar 
companies have estimated the reduced risk mitigated for 
similar attack vectors. 


During the debriefing, participants are sensitized to the 
correct selection of IT-security measures. It will be discussed 
whether the selection of the IT-security measure is best suited 
for the given attack vector or which IT-security measure would 
be more suitable. Based on the information provided during the 
participation it can be determined whether the most suitable IT-
security measure is economically reasonable for the 
participant. 


Furthermore, it can be discussed which altered aspects of the 
modelling would have caused other attack scenarios. This is 
particularly relevant for companies in order to gain insights into 
how the potential attack vectors are related to the effects of e.g. 
digital transformation. 


A detailed and personal feedback of the participants 
guarantees a continuous development of the serious game 
environment. This enables an increase in the number of 
participants through a permanent development and 
optimization of the serious game environment. Due to this 
procedure, a high number of participants is necessary to 
evaluate the economic aspects of IT-security measures.


5. Discussion


In order to be able to make valid statements about the 
economic profitability of IT-security measures, a sufficiently 
high number of participants is required. The openness of 
companies towards the topic of IT-security is decisive to reach 
this number of participants. Querying the economic dimensions 
of a possible attack represents sensitive company information, 
a high level of data protection has to be guaranteed. In order to 
realize the high number of participants, existing company 
contacts and close cooperation with many associations are 
relied upon.


Furthermore, the modelling of the companies and the 
derivation of attack vectors is a complex task, in which multiple 


challenges can occur. Due to the detailing of these two aspects, 
a modification of the presented concept may be necessary.
