Society 5.0 is the vision of a new human-centered society in the fifth stage launched by Japan. This paper
explores a prospective model of science, technology and innovation (STI) activities in Society 5.0 from an
ecosystem perspective. STI policy review and statistical analysis are conducted in comparison with Germany and
the United States to describe the historical transformation of Japan's STI ecosystem. Major socio-economic risks
on Japan's STI ecosystem can be classified as labor, capital and spatial risks. Shifting from a push-based STI
ecosystem to a pull-based STI ecosystem and increasing the system resilience through value creation for society
are essential to reduce three risks and to revitalize productivity and growth in Society 5.0.


1. Introduction


The Government of Japan has launched the vision of what it calls
“super-smart society”, or “Society 5.0” on April 2016 (CSTI, 2016). It is
defined as a new society in the fifth stage which follows four earlier
stages: the hunting society, the agrarian society, the industrial society
and the information society. It aims to create a human-centered society
in which products and services will be readily provided to satisfy var-
ious potential needs as well as to reduce economic and social gaps so
that all the people live a comfortable and vigorous life.


The vision is based on the recognition of the current global trends.
The pace of technological, economic and social change has been ac-
celerating, and business and communities struggle to keep up with the
speed. Fast progress of information and communications technology
(ICT) in recent years has brought about an unprecedented explosion of
digital data and the emergence and growth of cyberspace. Rapid glo-
balization has expanded various economic and social activities beyond
national borders, and also has been changing the process of creating
new ideas for innovation. It is now recognized that the new ideas are
generated through different sources and significantly contribute to
competitive advantage.


In such the chaotic era of drastic change, Japan looks beyond
Industry 4.0 toward Society 5.0, while paying particular attention to
other countries' policies, including Germany's Industry 4.0 and the
United States' Advanced Manufacturing Partnership. It strives to take
the transformation beyond industry and to build a super-smart society
in which new knowledge and values are continuously created to con-
tribute to economic growth and social welfare.


This paper explores a prospective model of science, technology and
innovation (STI) ecosystem in Society 5.0. The concept of an ecological
approach chosen in this paper was introduced by Moore (1993) to de-
scribe business environments, and is widely adopted to describe STI
environments (Council on Competitiveness, 2005; Adner, 2006; Fukuda
and Watanabe, 2008; Carayannis and Campbell, 2009; Traitler et al.,
2011; Zygiaris, 2013;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, 2015). Better analysis of both the economic and social
impacts of STI requires a deeper understanding of STI ecosystem which
includes the interaction between the actors, their technologies and their
business models, and the dynamics that structure this ecosystem
(Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 1997;
Jackson, 2011). Historical changes in Japan's STI ecosystem is ex-
amined with a focus on productivity and growth in comparison with
two leading countries, Germany and the United States, which take the
lead in the new industrial revolution to discuss a transformation path
for the future.


The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the
brief history of the national STI policies in three countries; Japan,
Germany and the United States. Section 3 assesses changes in Japan's
STI ecosystem over the past two decades compared to the above two
countries. Sections 4 describes the historical transformation of Japan's
STI ecosystem in the post-World War II era. Section 5 then discusses an
expected STI ecosystem for the future. Finally, Section 6 presents a
conclusion.

2. Political background


In the late 1990s, when rapid development of ICT, including mobile
phones and the internet, accelerated globalization of the world
economy, innovation become more important for economic growth
(European Commission, 2013). As interaction between various stake-
holders have become more important for innovation and innovation
systems, STI policy has been reformed in each country.


In the middle 2000s, The United States clearly declared the shift of
the innovation concept from the linear model to systemic model in
which innovation emerges from a complex ecosystem of relationships
and interactions (Council on Competitiveness, 2005). Germany, as well
as Japan, also implemented the national comprehensive policy founded
on the systemic model.


All those countries perceive AI as a key technology for the future
economic growth and social prosperity. While various policy measures
are adopted in each country to strengthen technological advantage and
develop the workforce, there is increased need for data governance.
Japan proposes the creation of a framework for discussing global data
governance among the G20 countries.


2.1. Japan


Japan's national STI policy is guided by the Science and Technology
Basic Plan which has been compiled every five year since 1996, fol-
lowing the enactment of the Science and Technology Basic Law in 1995.
The Basic Law's objective is to switch from catch-up growth to cutting-
edge growth by promoting science and technology through develop-
ment and implementation of well-integrated and well-planned policies
(Government of Japan, 1995; NSF Tokyo Office, 1996).


The Basic Plan identifies important research fields to address social
and economic challenges and the aspirations for systems reform re-
lating to STI rather than prioritized research agenda on a detailed level
(NSF Tokyo Office, 2003; MEXT, 2015). It is drawn up by the Council
for Science, Technology and Innovation (CSTI) in coordination with
related ministries. CSTI was launched in 2014 by the reorganization of
the Council for Science and Technology Policy (CSTP) which was es-
tablished with the January 2001 government reorganization in order to
function as “a control tower to promote science and technology” in
Japan.


The First Basic Plan for the period from 1996 to 2000 (Cabinet
Office, 1996) was adopted by the Cabinet in June 1996. Several key
provisions were intended to bring about long-term improvements in the
national science and technology system. The most important of these
was that the government was committed to invest 17 trillion yen over
the five years of the plan ended on March 31, 2001, aiming to increase
the government investment on research and development (R&D) to the
same level as major European countries and the United States on the
basis of gross domestic product (GDP).


The Second Plan for the five-year period from 2001 to 2005
(Cabinet Office, 2001) and Third Plan for the period from 2006 to
2010(Cabinet Office, 2006) sought to adopt a strategic approach to
government research investments. As a principle means for im-
plementing this objective, four mission-oriented research themes as
principal priority areas for emphasis during its five-year time span, and
four themes as secondary priority areas were identified.


The Fourth Basic Plan for the period from 2011 to 2015 (Cabinet
Office, 2011) emphasized the need for Japan to push innovations in
science and technology. It first announced the STI concept which aims
to shift from discipline-based approach to a problem-oriented approach
in order to address the real challenges such as the aging population, the
high national debt and the devastating effects of the Great East Japan
Earthquake of March 2011. CSTP was reorganized as CSTI to strengthen
its role, and launched two new programs, the Strategic Innovation
Promotion Program (SIP) and the Impulsing Paradigm Change through
Disruptive Technologies Program (ImPACT), designed to improve cross-


ministerial coordination and high-impact innovation.
The Fifth Basic Plan for the period from 2016 to 2020 (Cabinet


Office, 2016a) envisages the creation of Society 5.0. This vision of the
future is defined as a human-centered society in which products and
services will be readily provided to satisfy various potential needs and
also to reduce several gaps such as regional, generational, gender, lin-
guistic ones so that all the people live a comfortable and vigorous life. It
intends to tackle several economic and social challenges by going be-
yond just advanced use of ICT, artificial intelligence (AI) and robots
towards the transformation of society.


The Artificial Intelligence Technology Strategy was released in
March 2017 to promote inter-ministerial strategic research, develop-
ment and implementation of AI as a key technology for creation of
Society 5.0 (Strategic Council for AI Technology, 2017). One of five
pillars of the strategy is ethics and regulation of AI development while
the IT giants known as GAFA have been reported to collect huge
amounts of customer data to improve their business as have the Chinese
giants known as BAT (Lucas, 2017; Shigeta, 2019; Galloway, 2017) to
provide them to the government. With increasing global awareness of
importance of data sharing rules, the government called for launching
to the work to create a global rule, and released the Social Principles of
Human-centric AI in March 2019 (CSTI, 2019).


2.2. Germany


STI policy in Germany is governed by the federal government and
the 16 federal states (OECD, 2016a). After a long period of stagnation
coincident with the German reunification after the fall of the Berlin
Wall in 1989, Germany has revitalized its economy and competitiveness
since the early 2000s (Bastasin, 2013).


The federal policy has been guided by the High-Tech Strategy since
2006 to bring key STI stakeholders together in a common purpose of
developing new technologies. Most programs within the framework
promote partnership between different project partners. Some new in-
struments have been introduced to strengthen cooperation between
enterprises, universities and research institutions.


The High-Tech Strategy in the first phase (2006–2009) was the first
comprehensive national strategy for all its ministries to puts STI policy
front and center in government activities. While it focused on key
technologies to create lead markets, the High-Tech Strategy 2020in the
second phase (2010–2013) intended to overcome major social chal-
lenges through technological innovation (EFI - Commission of Experts
for Research and Innovation, 2015).


The new framework in the third phase started in 2014, the High-
Tech Strategy 2020Action Plan, identified 10 Future Projects as the
critical STI policy objectives to be addressed. One of them is the
“Industrie 4.0” which refers to the technological evolution from em-
bedded system to cyber-physical system. It represents the digital
transformation of manufacturing, leveraging the Internet of Things and
related technologies to realize connected factories, smart decentralized
manufacturing, self-optimizing systems and the digital supply chain in
the cyber-physical environment of the fourth industrial revolution.


The latest High-Tech Strategy 2025released in September 2018 set
out twelve missions, and one of them is “Rolling out AI” which aims to
make Germany one of the world's leading center for research, devel-
opment and application of AI. (Bundesministerium für Bildung und
Forschung (BMBF), 2018). Following the release, the Federal Govern-
ment's Artificial Intelligence strategy, dubbed “AI Made in Germany”,
was announced in November 2018 (The Federal Government, 2018)
which put its focus on the AI technologies as an essential driver pro-
moting smart industrial process in manufacturing and other sector and
thus taking “Industries 4.0” to the next level.


2.3. United States


The United States has reshaped its STI policy in the beginning of the

twenty-first century, facing serious competitive challenges posed by the
globalization (Thota and Munir, 2011). Two reports entitled “Innovate
America” (Council on Competitiveness, 2005) and “Rising Above the
Gathering Storm” (National Academy of SciencesNational Academy of
Engineering& Institute of Medicine, 2007) played a crucial role to de-
velop the America COMPETES Act enacted by the Bush Administration
in 2007. The Act focuses on three primary areas of importance to
maintaining and improving the national innovation capacity: i) in-
creasing research investment, ii) strengthening educational opportu-
nities in science, technology, engineering and mathematics from ele-
mentary through graduate school, and iii) developing an innovation
infrastructure.


The Obama Administration laid out the Strategy for American
Innovation which was first issued in 2009, and updated in 2011 and
2015 (NEC and OSTP, 2011; 2015). The Strategy sought to ensure that
our economic growth is sustained and to bring greater income, higher
quality jobs, and improved health and quality of life to all the nation's
citizens.


One of the federal government's major priorities was to transform
and reinvigorate advanced manufacturing in the United States after a
steep decline in its manufacturing sector in the 2000s (OECD, 2017a).
In July 2011, President Obama launched the Advanced Manufacturing
Partnership (AMP) which aims to bring academia, industry and gov-
ernment together and catalyze development and investment in the
emerging technologies, such as additive manufacturing/3D Printing
technologies, which will create high quality manufacturing jobs and
enhance our global competitiveness. Subsequently, the National Net-
work for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) program was proposed by
the Obama Administration proposed in January 2013 (Exective Office
of President, 2014).


The NNMI is modeled after the German Fraunhofer Institutes, and is
composed of competitively selected, independently managed manu-
facturing innovation institutes (Sargent, 2014; OECD, 2017a). The in-
stitutes serve as regional hubs which provide shared facilities to local
start-ups and small manufacturers to help them scale up new technol-
ogies, accelerate technology transfer to the marketplace and facilitate
the adoption of innovative developments across supply chains. They
also act as ‘teaching factories’ to build workforce skills at multiple levels
and to strengthen business capabilities in large and small companies.
The NNMI has 14 manufacturing innovation institutes at the beginning
of 2017.


The Trump administration unveiled a National Strategic Plan on
Advanced Manufacturing in October 2018 which focuses on developing
new manufacturing technologies, strengthening manufacturing work-
force, and expanding the capabilities of the domestic manufacturing
supply chain (Office of Science and Technology Policy, 2018). In Feb-
ruary 2019, the American AI Initiative was announced to boost the US
AI industry by some measures including promoting sustained R&D in-
vestment, developing the American workforce for AI. (The White
House, 2019).


3. Changes in science, technology and innovation ecosystem


This section analyzes changes in Japan's STI ecosystem over the two
decades using statistical data compared to Germany and the United
States.


3.1. Statistical data analysis


The focus of the analysis is put on productivity and growth since
innovation has been a major force in economic growth which rises the
level and growth rate of productivity in the long run (Ahn, 2002). The
data of growth and productivity was extracted from the Organization
for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) database (OECD,
2017b) which meet the international standards for economy-wide and
industry-level productivity measurement established by the OECD


(Jorgenson, 2011).
The following Cobb-Douglas production function is introduced to


compute marginal productivity of technology:


=Y Z R eµt (1)


where Y is total production, Z is production factors except for stock of
technological knowledge, R is stock of technological knowledge, μ is
rate of technical progress, and α and η are the elasticities of production
factors. Taking logarithm and differentiating totally both sides of
equation yields:


= + +µY/Y (Z/Z) (R/R) (2)


Equation (2) leads to MFP growth rate (MFPG) which is represented
as equation (3):


= = +µMFPG Y/Y (Z/Z) (R/R) (3)


Here, the elasticity α is represented as follows:


= Y/ R R/Y (4)


Thus equation (5) is obtained:


= +µMFPG (R/Y) (E/Y) (5)


where ρ is marginal productivity of technology, and E is expenditure on
R&D since the change of stock of technological knowledge equals ex-
penditure on R&D on the assumption that stock of technological
knowledge is not depreciated.


3.2. Key economic changes


3.2.1. GDP per capita
The compound average growth rate of GDP per capita growth in


Germany had declined from the late 1980s to the early 2000s during the
rapid globalization initiated by ICT development, as shown in Fig. 1.
The growth rate in Japan also declined from the late 1980s to the late
2000s, the five-year period longer than Germany. It recorded a sharp
decrease from the late 1980s to the early 1990s, and a negative rate in
the late 2000s after the slight recovery from the late 1990s to the early
2000s. Contrary to these two countries, The US recorded the highest
rate of 3.1% in the late 1990s followed by the 2.7% in the late 1980s.
After the depression in the late 2000s, every growth rate in three
countries changed to increase in the early 2010s while big data ana-
lytics emerged as a key issue for leading innovation.


3.2.2. Productivity
Total hours worked in Germany and Japan caused the stagnated


productivity growth in the 1990s and the 2000s (Fig. 1.) as the in-
novation process became more interactive. It dropped to negative rates
from the early 1990s to the early 2000s in Germany, from the early
1990s and to the late 2000s in Japan as well as over the 2000s in the
United States.


The decline of multifactor productivity (MFP) is another factor in
stagnation of productivity growth in two countries. Especially in Japan,
both steep falls from the late 1980s to the 1990s and from the early
2000s to the late 2000s have halved the growth rate on a percentage
point basis. Such a clear relationship is not apparent in the United
States while it more than doubled over the two decades from the late
1980s to the early 2000s followed by shrinking by almost two-third in
the latest two decades.


3.2.3. R&D investment
Each country strengthened its investment on R&D in the recent


decade (Fig. 2.). Japan steadily grew the expenditure on R&D from the
late 1980s to the late 2000s. Germany and the United States has in-
creased their expenditure since the early 2000s as the innovation pro-
cess model made the shift from linear to open.

3.2.4. Marginal productivity of technology
Germany continued to decrease its marginal productivity of tech-


nology from the early 1990s to the late 2000s (Fig. 3.). Japan also
dropped its marginal productivity sharply in the late 1980s, and it
turned to negative in the late 2000s. Contrary to these two countries,
the United States increased its marginal productivity from the late
1980s to the early 2000s while the innovation process became more
globally collaborative by means of rapid development of ICT. It


stagnated in the early 2010s whereas two other countries increased as
AI and other technologies were emerged.


3.2.5. Contribution to GDP by economic sectors
Information and communication increased its share in the early


2000s in each country (Fig. 4.) amid rapid technological advances in
this sector. Manufacturing maintained its contribution of almost 20% of
GDP in Germany and Japan, and of 12% in the United States in which
service activities made a large contribution of around 36–38%. Service
activities grew in Japan by 2.5 percentage point over the two decades
while it slightly decreased in Germany and the United States.


3.2.6. Trade in services
Three countries have grown service exports and imports over the


two decades (Fig. 5.) while ICT transforms the process of value creation
where two-way communication between customer and producer en-
hances user participating in product and value co-creation. Germany
recorded the largest growth and more than tripled the exports to di-
minish its trade deficit. Japan also decreased its deficit while its exports
was doubled during the same period. The United States maintained and
increased its trade surplus over the period from the late 1980s to the
early 2010s.


3.2.7. Gross fixed capital formation
The share of gross fixed capital formation in GDP in Germany


slightly declined over the past two decades (Fig. 6.) as products and
services began available through digital channels. Japan apparently
dropped the share from the early 1990s to the early 2010s. The share in
the United States also fell by two percentage point from the early 2000s
to the early 2010s. On the other hand, intellectual property product
grew its share in GDP in each country over the past three decades.


3.2.8. Household final consumption expenditure
The share of household final consumption expenditure in the final


consumption expenditure in Japan continued to fall from the early
1990s to the early 2010s as shown in Fig. 7. Germany also decreased
the share by two percentage point over the past two decades along with
business model transformation to deliver personalized customer ex-
periences and maintain customer engagement. Contrary to these two

countries, the United States increased the share steadily from the early
1990s to the early 2010s.


4. Japan's science, technology and innovation ecosystem
transformation


The above observations indicate the historical transformation of STI
ecosystem in Japan as follows.


4.1. Post-world war II period by the late 1980s


Japan tried hard to catch up with other industrialized countries by
importing advanced technologies after the end of World War II. These


efforts drove the high economic growth from the mid-1950s to the early
1970s and the subsequent stable economic growth from the early 1970s
to the early 1980s. After the three-decade long “economic miracle”,
Japan experienced its “bubble economy” in which stock and estate
prices soared to great heights in the late 1980s (Ohno, 2006). With the
bubble burst in the early 1990s, however, the Japanese economy
plunged into a long recession.


4.2. The 1990s


Japan sharply decreased MPF growth over the 1990s whereas the
United States increased its growth from the early 1990s to the early
2000s. A key factor of this contrast is ICT investment (Fukao et al.,

2006; Colecchia and Schreyer, 2001). The US strong investment in ICT
capital made a great contributed to large capital accumulation in the
business sector and led to the positive effects on economic growth. On
the other hand, Japan suffered low contribution of ICT investment to
economic growth while it increased R&D investment under the First
Science and Technology Basic Plan. Germany also reaped few benefits
from the positive effects of ICT investment on economic growth and
declined MFP growth in the late 1990s.


The low levels of ICT investment caused lower contribution of labor
input to economic growth in the 1990s and the 2000s. Japanese firms
were reluctant to introduce ICT for saving unskilled labor input because
of the high job security in Japan. They also have provided limited
training opportunities for temporary or part-time workers while the
percentage of these workers in total workers has been increased (Fukao
et al., 2014).


In addition, rapid ICT development brought radical changes to the

production and delivery of goods and services and also supported the
emergence of a globalized market (European Commission, 2016).
Businesses are significantly expanded through computer-based logistics
systems that help firms manage complex globalized supply-chains, or
through software that facilitates the organization of business activities
in dispersed locations. These new globalized production chains enable
enterprises to specialize in what they are good at and contract out what
they are not good at.


These changes have enhanced the adoption of modular designs in
many industries in the United States (Baldwin and Clark, 1997;
Sturgeon, 2002). Some major firms, including Hewlett Packard and
IBM, led the way to break up of vertically integrated corporate struc-
tures and to aggregate cast-off activities in suppliers. Contrary to such
efforts by the US firms, Japanese firms struggled to adapt to the new
business environment due to their established corporate structures. The
tight linkages between lead firms and suppliers have been identified as
a source of competitive advantage for Japanese firms (Dyer, 1996;
21PPI, 2015) whereas suppliers are able to work with multiple firms
because of the high degree of product modularity in the new business
environment. Such a mismatch resulted in the dramatic economic
slowdown over the 1990s.


4.3. The 2000s


Rising global trade volumes associated with ICT development
boosted growth in developing countries in the late 1990s and ac-
celerated its growth rates in the 2000s (Cubeddu et al., 2014). Their
rapid growth threatened competitive advantages of developed coun-
tries, and also rose severe global challenges such as climate change,
energy and food security risks, and water crises. These emerging chal-
lenges drove a paradigm shift in national strategies for STI in major
developed countries over the 2000s. As reviewed above, Germany
launched the High-Tech Strategy in 2006, and the United States enacted
the America COMPETES Act in 2007.


Japan also strengthened the approach to problem solving which
encourages to open up the innovation process (Fukuda and Watanabe,
2008). This approach represents the concept of open innovation which
has taken off in the early 2000s (Chesbrough, 2003; Van Der Zee et al.,
2015). The open innovation model is dynamic and non-linear in its
approach, and seeks to leverage both external and internal sources for
innovative opportunities through multiple channels, including alli-
ances, collaborations, spin-offs and outsourcings (Docherty, 2006).


Some Japanese lead firms made efforts to overcome the “Not
Invented Here” syndrome in the early 2000s (21PPI, 2015). Toray In-
dustries, Inc. Launched Project New TORAY21 (Project NT21) in April
2002 to improve the corporate governance, just after falling into the red
in the March 2002 settlement for the first time since its foundation. This
project intended to strengthen the corporate structure and to recover
the lost revenue. On the agenda included promoting R&D innovation
which encouraged leveraging external resources. In the same year,
Kyoto University and five lead companies have established a compre-
hensive and integrative industry-academia partnership for innovation.
This partnership aimed to create new businesses through the research
and development of next-generation innovative technologies in organic
electronic materials and devices.


The government also introduced some measures to catalyze colla-
boration between academia and industry since the role of research
universities have received a lot of attention from many research-in-
tensive firms as sources of new scientific and technological knowledge
and of the skilled technical personnel (Feller, 2009). National research
institutes and national universities were incorporated in 2001 and
2004, and launched their intellectual property offices to enhance col-
laborative activities with industry.


These efforts contributed to recovery of MFP growth in the early
2000s. However, the growth turned into negative in the late 2000s
while Germany and the United States sustained the positive rates


despite the severe economic conditions which led to the bankruptcy of
Lehman Brothers in 2008 and its consequences. Japan had benefited
little from the positive effects of ICT investment on economic growth
since the 1990s as mentioned above, and this experience led to the
continuous decline in gross fixed capital formation over the 2000s.


Furthermore, Japan struggled with the long-term fall in household
consumption and shift in demand from goods and services. These trends
represent a new paradigm shift in production from “making things” to
“making stories”, or from “monozukuri” to “kotozukuri” in Japanese
(Keizai Doyukai, 2013; Ministry of Internal Affairs and
Communications, 2013). Japanese firms provided value-added products
with high standards and quality achieved through their manufacturing
excellence from manufacturers’ perspective. They utilized ICT to avoid
product commoditization and to make their products more attractive
than others over the 1990s. However, a relationship between consumer
and producer was changed as the usage and adaptation of the Internet
by businesses and consumers extremely grew over the 2000s. Any
consumer became a content creator in collaboration with other con-
sumers or producers while they had been a viewer of content provided
by producers (Cormode and Krishnamurthy, 2008). This change re-
quired producers to seek new models of added-value creation for cus-
tomers. Komatsu Ltd., a lead manufacturer of construction and mining
machinery in Japan, created a business model to provide machine data
through its remote monitoring system called KOMTRAX, and to
proactively schedule and perform maintenance at times that work best
for an owner or a maintenance engineer. Despite such advanced efforts,
many Japanese firms strived to establish relationships with customers.


4.4. The 2010s


The STI value chain has continued to expand in the 2010s, and of-
fering an integrated solution for customers by bundling the products
and services is the key to success in innovation. The shift from product-
focused to customer-centric approach accelerates as ICT and its appli-
cations permit a precise segmentation, profiling and targeting of cus-
tomers (Gurău et al., 2003; Priem, 2007; Keizai Doyukai, 2013; MIC,
2013). Martinez et al. (2010) identify the five pillars which form a
supporting foundation necessary for manufacturing organizations to
become product-service providers: embedded product-service culture,
delivery of integrated offering, internal processes and capabilities,
strategic alignment and supplier relationships. Japanese lead manu-
facturing firms take advantage of their vertically integrated structures
and long-term trust relationships with their suppliers to strengthen
their performance. Their recovery leads to improvement of Japanese
economic performance in the early 2010s subsequent to two lost dec-
ades.


The government put Internet of Things (IoT), big data, robotics, and
AI at the heart of its revitalizing strategy. Collaborative activities across
public and private sectors are encouraged to integrate functionality
derived from these technologies into existing manufacturing products.
However, the technologies carry some risk and present policy chal-
lenges along several dimensions including jobs, safety and regulatory
rules. To realize the human-centered Society 5.0, the government pro-
posed setting up international guidelines on AI R&D, and continues to
lead international discussions about frameworks for the development
and utilization of the cutting-edge technologies to protect consumers.


5. Science, technology and innovation ecosystem for the future


5.1. Rise of data-driven innovation


Two lost decades eroded Japan's confidence and competitiveness
(Desvaux et al., 2015). In addition to accelerate the pace of economic
recovery, Japan is eager to prepare to Society 5.0 which is coming
through data-driven innovation. The generation and use of huge vo-
lumes of data are leading from the confluence of several trends,


K. Fukuda International Journal of Production Economics 220 (2020) 107460

including the increasing migration of economic and social activities to
the Internet and the decline in the cost of data collection, storage and
processing. These large data sets, or “big data”, are becoming a core
asset in STI ecosystem which enhances productivity, fosters new in-
dustries and create economic competitive advantages and social welfare
benefits (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,
2015; Arai, 2016).


Data-driven innovation begins to transform all industrial sectors
(Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2015;
Ministry of EconomyTrade and Industry, 2017; MEXT, 2016). In man-
ufacturing, firms are increasingly using sensors mounted on production
machines and delivered products to collect and process data on the
machines' and products’ operation. One of the enablers is the IoT where
sensor equipped machines with connectivity transmit data to other
machines and computer systems, automating many processes and also
gathering vast quantities of new types of data. Benefits of data-driven
innovation in healthcare include new insights into the natural history of
diseases and their diagnosis, prevention and treatment, and greater
opportunity for further development of personalized therapies. Health
data can be used to improve patient care, to understand the burden of
illness and quality of life of the population, and to manage and evaluate
public health interventions, including for health promotion and pre-
vention. In transportation, matching demand and supply in real time
allows shaving peak demand by redistributing it in space, reducing road
congestion. This can save people time and money and reduce pollution
and emissions in cities. (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, 2016b).


Data-driven innovation is described as a sequence of phases from
data collection and generation to data analytics and decision making
(Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2015).
This process is not linear but can be seen as a cycle which involves
feedback loops at several phases of the value creation process. The heart
of the process lies data, and online platforms play an increasingly
central role. Online platforms cover a wide range of activities such as
online marketplaces, communications services, internet search services,
and social media and creative content outlets. They facilitate interac-
tions between producers and consumers to create the community, to
collect and even generate data through these interactions, and to
maximize the total values for their members (Martens, 2016; Van
Alstyne et al., 2016). Such online platforms reshape markets and in-
dustries into interconnected business environment so that industry
boundaries will dramatically blur (Ministry of EconomyTrade and
Industry, 2017; MEXT, 2016).


Data-driven innovation may induce structural change in labor
markets since it enables the automation of an increasing number of
cognitive and manual tasks (Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development, 2015; Ministry of EconomyTrade and Industry,
2017; Takigawa, 2017). The rapid progress in artificial intelligence
enables machines to carry out a broad range of job, and begins to
hollow out of mid-level skills jobs. This trend raises job polarization in
which middle-skill jobs are declining and the workforce is divided into
two groups: highly paid, skilled workers and low-paid, unskilled
workers. Furthermore, rising life expectancy makes most people more
conscious of their lengthening working lives while data-driven in-
novation is changing the way of working (Gratton and Scott, 2016,
2017). In response to the pressures resulting from longer working lives,
individuals are starting to explore different career structures. Working
longer secures a reasonable retirement income, but at the same time,
requires the individual's intangible assets which includes skills and
knowledge, strong mental and physical health, and diverse networks
which support personal change and transitions.


5.2. Socio-economic risks in Japan's science, technology and innovation
ecosystem


Data-driven innovation comes with major economic and social


challenges which most countries will face. Japan needs mitigate the
following three major socio-economic risks to maximize the benefits of
data-driven innovation and revitalize its productivity and growth to-
ward Society 5.0.


5.2.1. Labor risks
According to the United Nations (United Nations Statistics Division,


2017), the population of Japan had shrunk by 0.7 million people in five
years from 2010 to 2015, and is expected to decline by 22.1 million
people to 2050 (Fig. 8.). Its population of working-age from 15 to 64
has been in decline since the early 2000s. It had shrunk by 4.2 million
people in five years from 2010 to 2015, and is estimated to plunge by
almost one-third to 2050. The working-age population of Germany is
expected to fall down slower than Japan from 2015 to 2050 whereas
the United States will continue to increase by 22.3 million over the
same period. It is also a serious agenda for Japan to accelerate progress
towards gender equality. On the report of the Global Gender Gap Index
(World Economic Forum, 2015; 2016), Japan has maintained much
lower positions than Germany and the United States in both rankings by
the global index and the category of economic participation and op-
portunity as shown in Fig. 9. With its workforce shrinking and wide
gender gap, Japan has to rely on productivity as its primary catalyst for
growth.


5.2.2. Capital risks
Significantly less risk money available to entrepreneurs is one of the


problems to be addressed in risk-averse Japan. The venture capital re-
presents a very small percentage of GDP in Japan as well as Germany
and other many countries (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, 2016c). The United States is the exception in which the
venture capital industry is more mature and represents 0.33% of GDP in
2015 (Fig. 10.). Its amount is very huge and accounted for 85% of total
venture capital investments in the OECD countries in 2015. The ratio of
later stage venture capital is much smaller in Japan than in two other
countries. Japanese venture capital is most invested in startups at the
early stage in which the idea has been transformed into a product and is
being produced and sold, but is less invested in startups at the seed
stage in which they seek for funding for the ideas or the expansion and
pre-IPO (initial public offering) stages in which they try to expand the
market share or go public (VEC, 2016). Another problem is huge cor-
porate savings (Cabinet Office, 2016b). The savings of Japanese cor-
poration has increased since the early 2000s and has reached 20 per-
cent of GDP in the early 2010s (Fig. 11.). This ratio is higher than
around 13.0% in Germany and around 10.0% in the United States.


5.2.3. Spatial risks
It is estimated that the working age population aged 15 to 64 will


fall down in each region as shown in Fig. 12 (IPSS, 2013). The rate of
municipalities which more than half the population are not of working-
age will increase in all the regions. Especially in Hokkaido and Tohoku
which are located in the northern part of Japan, the rate will exceed
40% in 2025 and 70% in 2040. Such demographic projections indicate
that economic activities in Japan will be distributed more unevenly and
the regional divide will be widened in the next few decades.


5.3. Managing socio-economic risks


The following three measures are required to effectively tackle the
above socio-economic risks.


5.3.1. Deploying next generation technologies
Deploying next generation technologies contributes to improving


labor productivity. The survey was conducted by the Cabinet Office to
clarify impacts of technology implementation on labor productivity in
Japanese firms, focusing on five technologies consisting of IoT or big
data, AI, robots, 3D printing, and cloud computing (Cabinet Office,


K. Fukuda International Journal of Production Economics 220 (2020) 107460


9






2017). In the survey, an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analysis
was conducted on the respondent firms (n=1466) to determine the
impact of technology implementation on productivity increase
(Table 1). The dependent variable is productivity increase which is
defined as a change rate of nominal value added per regular employee
from the fiscal year 2012 to the fiscal year 2015. The explanatory

variables include technology implementation (coded as 0=none of
five technologies implemented, 1= one or more of five technologies
implemented), the capital to labor ratio, and industry dummy variables.
The causal effect of technology implementation on labor productivity
was also estimated by using a decentralized level of decision-making as
an instrumental variable (IV). The results of both OLS and IV methods
suggest that technology implementation makes a statistically significant


contribution to productivity increase when taking account of the re-
verse causation, that is, a firm with higher productivity is more likely to
implement new technologies.


Increased automation through deploying next generation technol-
ogies will affect jobs in many industries. However, it is predicted that
the pursuit of new growth markets and a projected decline in Japan's
labor force could cushion the net impact on employment (Desvaux

et al., 2015). One big trend is a collaborative robot, or so-called “a
cobot,” which are designed to work alongside human workers, assisting
them with a variety of tasks. Collaborative robots are gaining popu-
larity since sensors and computer power have become so cheap that
they decrease the cost of the robots and make them more available to
businesses of all sizes including small and medium-sized enterprises
(Tobe, 2015; Prodhan, 2016). A significant surge in demand for cobots
having a payload capacity between 5 and 10 kg is observed recent years
as they are the safest robot for a majority of factory automation tasks
and can be substitute for heavier robots. The cobots having this payload
capacity range are provided by some major companies including KUKA
AG in Germany and FANUC Corporation in Japan as well as by many
emerging startups in the United States and Europe including Veo Ro-
botics, Inc. and Osaro, Inc. Such cobots startups are expected to con-
tribute to the rapid market growth in next few years while incumbents
are catching up with the market trend (CB Insights, 2018).


5.3.2. Corporate governance reforms
Organizing for discipline and performance is effective in improving


capital productivity. The corporate governance reform has been per-
formed in Japan to evolve its traditional economic management system
characterized by the union of lifetime employment and seniority-based


workplaces (Cabinet Office, 2016b; Ministry of EconomyTrade and
Industry, 2017). The Corporate Governance Code which took effect in
June 2015 seeks to make companies more transparent and responsive to
shareholders. The Practical Guidelines for Corporate Governance Sys-
tems was released as a supplementary document to the Code in March
2016 which details practical approaches to effective corporate gov-
ernance and productive actions to boost the earnings. These efforts are
expected to encourage a manager to develop a positive mindset and
take investment risks, and then result in higher productivity and prof-
itability in Japanese economy.


5.3.3. Value creation for cities and communities
The gap between urban and rural economies has one of the critical


challenges to be addressed in Japan. Toyama (2015) points out that
Japanese economy is divided into two spheres with different players:
the global sphere with large firms competing for a share of the world
market and the local economic sphere with community-based small and
medium-sized companies putting a focus on customer-facing services. It
is necessary in the global sphere to develop and distribute products and
services globally and at the same time to optimize them for local con-
sumers. However, a different approach is effective in the local sphere,
which starts to innovate for people in local community and then dis-
tribute these innovations globally (Govindarajan and Trimble, 2012).


Despite the difference between the strategic approaches in the
global and local spheres, expectation of creating values for the society is
growing in both spheres while rising inequalities in earnings and in
wealth is a major concern in many countries (OECD, 2017c). Firms are
required to think and align the interests of shareholders and societies
for mutual benefit in the long-term (Porter and Kramer, 2006; Kramer
and Porter, 2011). In Japan, many projects on value creation for cities
and communities have been launched supported by both public and
private funds:


▪ Kashiwa-no-ha Smart City (Mitsui Fudosan, Co., Ltd., 2016): The
Kashiwa-no-ha area, located outside Tokyo, is home to the Uni-
versity of Tokyo, Chiba University, and national research institution
campuses. As part of the Kashiwa-no-ha International Campus Town
Initiative, the goal is to build a city on this foundation which is
integrated with the environment, promotes long and healthy lives,
and cultivates industrial innovation. The project promotes accessi-
bility by public transportation and enhance the environment for
bicycle use by building cycling paths and bicycle sharing systems in
order to reduce the use of automobiles. Preceding initiatives have
been undertaken to visualize energy usage to heighten the sense of
engagement among residents and electricity sharing between dis-
tricts through Japan's first case of distributed power sourcing. Some
guidelines are also adopted which require new buildings to provide
a certain level of environmental performance.


▪ Town of Tamaki, Mie Prefecture (Town of Tamaki, 2016): Tamaki is
one of municipalities coping with the inconvenience of living in

sparsely populated areas in aging Japan. The town introduced a
demand-responsive transport system developed by the University of
Tokyo in 2009 to give senior citizens free rides in minivans. The
system eliminates the need to call an operator, and optimizes dis-
patch and route planning so that new passenger reservations do not
disrupt or delay services to already-booked passengers (OECD,
2016d). The on-demand bus service supported by the system en-
courages elderly residents in Tamaki to go out and participate in
community events, and contribute to reducing medical costs per
users compared to those per non-users.


▪ Agricultural Production Corporation GRA Inc. (Ministry of Internal
Affairs and Communications, 2014 MIC, 2014): GRA was estab-
lished at Town of Yamamoto, Miyagi Prefecture, in July 2011, just
after devastated by the 2011 he Great East Japan Earthquake. The
GRA Group has developed the computer-aided facilities for straw-
berry farming. Their objective was to revitalize the key industry in
Yamamoto through combining the wisdom of farmers with the
precision of technology. The facilities support the management of
cultivation processes and products, and also contribute to building a
strong brand image. Their strawberry-farming system has been im-
plemented to India since 2012 to help the local agricultural industry
in collaboration with the local non-governmental organization.


6. Conclusion


STI ecosystems are subjected to short-term shocks, such as economic
bankruptcy and a technological breakthrough, and are also subjected to
slowly changing long-term stresses, such as demographic changes and
globalization. System resilience enables STI ecosystems to recover its
stable state after short-term shocks and long-term stresses, and plays an
important role in maintaining conditions which sustain STI activities as
a major force in growth and productivity improvement.


Japan's STI ecosystem has been severely affected by rapid ICT de-
velopment in the 1990s which brought the radical changes to the
production and delivery of goods and services and the emergence of a
globalized market, and also caused the changing business environment
which required agility and flexibility. The ecosystem became vulner-
able to these shocks and stresses, and decreased the system resilience
while the process of value creation has shifted from independent to
interactive, from close to open, from stable to dynamic. This system
damage resulted in the dramatic economic slowdown over the decade
in Japan.


In the 2000s, Japan's STI continued to suffer from the shocks and
stresses bought by rapid ICT development and consequences which
include a paradigm shift in production from “making things” to
“making stories”. However, it has gradually recovered the system re-
silience through strengthening the approach to problem solving which
encourages to open up the innovation process, to offer an integrated
solution for customers by bundling the products and services, and the
shift from product-focused to customer-centric approach.


The recovery of the system resilience leads to improvement of
Japanese economic performance in the early 2010s subsequent to two
lost decades. However, Japan's STI ecosystem faces of the next shocks
and stresses as AI and other cutting-edge technologies are emerged.
This recognition encourages Japan to look beyond industry 4.0 toward
Society 5.0 which is coming through data-driven innovation.


Japan's STI ecosystem is shifting from a push-based system to a pull-
based system. Whereas the actors offer efficient solutions to problems to
be addressed in a push-based system, a new push-based ecosystem
brings value source from the inside and outside of the system. The key
functional service of the system is to facilitate value creation for Society
5.0 in which all the people live a comfortable and vigorous life.
Expanding this functional service depends on keeping the resilient STI
ecosystem. The risk mitigation measures mentioned above, such as
deploying next generation technologies, corporate governance reforms,
and value creation for cities and communities, could contribute to


increasing the system resilience. The public and private sectors will
have to work together to create the right environment for growth, fo-
cusing on labor market frameworks, entrepreneurship, competition,
and talent and skills development as well as safety and regulatory of
data sharing. These efforts could maximize the benefits of data-driven
innovation and revitalize its productivity and growth in Society 5.0.


This paper reviews relevant topics to STI activities in three coun-
tries, but provides a balanced overview of topics and essentials for the
future from an ecosystem perspective. Further study is required to un-
derstand historical complex dynamics of STI ecosystem and develop
practical approaches to increase the system resilience.
