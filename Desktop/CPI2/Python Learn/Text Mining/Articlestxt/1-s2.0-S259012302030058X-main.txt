We are witnessing a transition to a digital economy, popularized by academics and practitioners as the Fourth
Industrial Era, also designated as Industry 4.0 (I4.0). Among all the available digital technologies and aiming to
optimize the Architecture Engineering and Construction (AEC) supply chain, the Building Information Modelling
(BIM) is becoming officially mandatory worldwide. Oriented to a zero-waste, zero-ecological footprint and
reduced time to execute the constructions, from the BIM, emerges a new procurement model which will affect
many sectors integrating this supply chain, especially those more traditional and fragmented ones, such as the
Ornamental Stone sector (OS). Addressing this problem through the Service Science perspective, the objective of
this research was to conceptualize an Empirical Framework (EF), to evaluate the impact of the Industry4.0 op-
erations on the Time-to-Deliver the products in a digital marketplace context. By applying this EF to a case study
related to the Ornamental Stone in Portugal, it was found a positive impact of Industry 4.0 operations on the
delivery time in the digital marketplace context.

1. Introduction


Boosted by the integration of Information and Communication
Technologies (ICT), we are witnessing a transition to a digital economy,
popularized by academics and practitioners as the Industry 4.0 (I4.0).


Among the several I4.0 technologies, with yet unpredictable impacts
on the supply chain, the Building Information Modelling (BIM) is
becoming mandatory by several governments [2] in the Architecture
Engineering and Construction (AEC) which will probably require the
shifting in the company’s operations in some sectors [3].


In a simple way, wemay define BIM as a collaborative technology that
combines the virtual simulation with the horizontal and vertical inte-
gration in a consistent and interconnected digital Information and
Communication system [4], and therefore it may be accepted as one of
the I4.0 technologies [5]. Moreover, with the BIM Technology, the AEC
market becomes a digital marketplace [6].


Oriented to a zero-waste, zero-ecological footprint and reduced time
to execute the constructions, from the BIM, emerges a new procurement
model, which will affect all the sectors on AEC supply chain, especially

those more traditional and fragmented ones, such as the Ornamental
Stone sector (OS) [7].


Traditionally the AEC procurement is made after the building design
phase. In the BIM context, the procurement occurs during the building
design phase [8]. In a Standard digital format [9] and publicly tendered
on the Internet [10], the construction products and materials are
pre-designed (standardized) and made available to BIM workstation
operators by their providers in the digital web-libraries [11]. In practical
terms, the BIM Procurement” anticipates the procurement to the building
design phase [12].


Directly employing more than 16.000 people, the Portuguese Orna-
mental Stone (OS) sector is relevant to the national economy, also
because it is one of the main private employer in the interior territories as
well as the second sector in the country on value-added per working hour
[6]. Although this is a typical traditional and fragmented sector, since
2004 we have witnessed in this activity in Portugal, a trend to employ
skills as well as the incorporation of modern and innovative production
technologies, which has guaranteed since then, a consolidated growth in
exports and value-added [13].

The stone is a natural rawmaterial and therefore it has natural defects
and heterogenic characteristics. Thus, to finish each piece of stone, it
must be processed in a singular way, which slows down the
manufacturing process.


In the beginning of the first decade of the XXI century, a prospective
study [14] has identified the lack of flexibility and waste reduction as a
priority, from which has started a lean and flexible R&D movement in-
side the Portuguese OS sector, popularized as Leanstone Hornbook (LH)
[15], integrating Universities, technology companies and OS companies.


The first wave of digital OS technologies development began in 2006
through the Jetstone Mobilizer Project. From the Jetstone has resulted
from several flexible and digital shop-floor floor innovative technologies,
which from that time up to now are been incorporated gradually by some
OS companies [16].


The second wave of digital technology started in 2010 with Inovstone
Mobilizer Project, which had as outputs digital technologies to integrate
the shop-floor resources in the operations of the companies.


The third wave of digital technological developments began in 2017
through the Inovstone4.0 Mobilizer Project. From this Project, has
resulted in industrial solutions oriented to the co-creation of value in the
digital marketplace and with BIM technologies [15].


All these technologies are today the state of the art and from 2006 are
been incorporated gradually by some of the OS companies [5]. Collab-
oratively integrating these technologies and connecting the factory to the
BIM stations, these companies are moving towards the I4.0 Operations
[17]. Moreover, the BIM stations used by the building designers, mostly
architects and engineers, connected in a co-creative way to these type of
stone providers.


Nevertheless, not all the Portuguese OS companies have adopted the
Leanstone technologies and therefore still keep their operations in a
traditional mode which means no digital production machines in the
shop-floor and communications with the market by phone and email
only.


One of the official reasons for the mandatory use of BIM in the AEC
[2] is its contribution to reduce the time to build, which is assessed
through the fourth dimension of the IFC (Industrial Foundation Class)
objects [18] as well as the rework reduction [19]. This official reason to
make BIM mandatory pushes the procurement towards fast delivery time
products [20] becoming a threat to the economic sustainability of the
Portuguese OS sector whose competitiveness is based on products cus-
tomization which slows down the processing time.


As part of the European Program supporting research, development,
dissemination, and financing of practices and digital technologies assis-
ted by Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), and built on the European Parlia-
ment document [21,22], the European Union considers that I4.0
operations may reverse the industrial decline seen in Europe in recent
years. Being aware of what is happening around them, companies man-
agers and managers are realizing that I4.0 may bring new opportunities
regarding the sustainability of their companies [23]. To connect a factory
to the Internet and support production through CPS’s involves risks, from
the investment required to the very maturity of the available digital
production technologies [24]. However, representing more than 20% of
jobs, equivalent to more than 34 million people and generating over
6400 billion euros annually [25], the European industry cannot risk
losing the lead and becoming outdated in this transition stage to the
Fourth Industrial Age.


In BIM AEC context, the customers are mostly architects among other
BIM operators, who search for building components through digital li-
braries, on which providers place their products in IFC format [26]. This
Marketplace model is oriented to standardized products, which means,
that leaves out companies that offer customized products such as the
Portuguese OS, thus becoming a threat to their future [15].


Looking at the BIM, it is a digital technology for designing, procuring
and managing AEC projects and through its global utilization, the Gov-
ernments intend to transform the AEC into the transparent and digital
marketplace [27]. Booted by EU Initiatives, we are witnessing a trend

2

towards the digital production supported by CPS’s, intending to trans-
form the traditional operations to I4.0 operations towards personalized
and collaborative manufacturing.


In this context, the following research question arises: What is the
impact of I4.0 technologies, on the time-to-deliver the products on the
traditional and fragmented sectors in the digital marketplace context?


The Service Science (S|S) is an emerging and multidisciplinary
approach for which the value results from the interactions among service
systems entities, which compute value given the concerns of multiple
stakeholders [28]. Those interactions occur, according to the Service
Science perspective, because there are legitimate expectations in each of
the stakeholders involved, where part of the co-created value is attrib-
uted to it [29]. Addressing this problem through the Service Science
perspective, the objective of this research is, therefore, to conceptualize
an empirical framework (EF), to evaluate the impact of the I4.0 tech-
nologies on the delivery time of the products on traditional and frag-
mented sectors in a digital marketplace context. The empirical context of
this framework will be a case study related to the Portuguese OS sector.


2. Literature review


According to some authors, a scientific discipline is a set of methods
and standards, accepted and used by a community, to develop a Body of
Knowledge that explains and typifies observable phenomena in the world
[30].


Thus, it was necessary to attribute to S|S the conceptual structures,
theories, models and laws that could not only be empirically tested but
also applied to the benefit of society. Probably with this in mind, the
foremost advocates of S|S, considered that S|S must be viewed as a sci-
entific field under construction, for which the Body of Knowledge would
emerge slowly but with a challenge to become truly interdisciplinary
[31].


This led to the construction of S|S Theory, which could support it as a
scientific field, taking into account its interdisciplinarity and considering
the Sustainability of the Planet as a transversal concern, in exchanging
service and assuming the Service-Dominant Logic (SDL) as its philo-
sophical anchor [32].


The First Service Science Principle has been defined as service system
entities dynamically configure four types of resources: people, technol-
ogies, organizations, and information (Stephen Vargo & Akaka, 2009),
since the purpose of economic relations for the SDL mindset is the ex-
change of service among entities aiming for a reciprocal benefit [33], that
is, for SDL exchange service for service [34].


The Second Service Science Principle has been defined as service
system entities compute value given the concerns of multiple stake-
holders [28] since the relationships between s|systems are based on value
propositions, which from the S|S perspective can be understood as a s|
system’s request for another s|system to execute an action. Thus, a value
proposition seems to be the basic relationship among s|systems, in the
form of service exchange or service interactions [28].


The Third Service Science Principle has been defined as the access
rights associated with a customer, and provider resources are reconfig-
ured by mutually agreed to value propositions [28] since, in the tradi-
tional view (G-D Logic) [35], the producer is the main actor who
produces goods and services, and consumers are secondary actors or
passive recipients [34]. According to G-D logic, the producer is the source
of knowledge and creativity, and therefore also the only source of
product innovation [36].


As an emergent discipline whose Body of Knowledge was raised
already in the Digital Age, the S|S Theory provides good support to
address the digital environments, such as the I4.0 operations [37].
Within the building industry, there has been increasing interest to the
building service systems integration, in order to enhance design out-
comes, and to detect or even avoid the service systems’ clashes and
conflicts [38].

3. Research methodology and empirical framework


According to S|S Theory, the impact of innovation on processes must
be assessed through the Innovation Outcomes (IO) (Stephen Vargo &
Akaka, 2009), which results from the evolution of the main stakeholders’
concerns. This means we may introduce the concept of Key Concern In-
dicator (KCI) (Equation 1) as the inverse of Key Performance to evaluate
the Concerns evolution of the main stakeholders.


KCI¼ 1
KPI


(1a)


According to some authors [39], an “empirical framework” can be
defined as a set of interrelated objectives and fundamentals, where the
objectives identify the goals, and the fundamentals are the underlying
concepts that help achieve those goals [40]. In social sciences, a research
methodology can be qualitative, quantitative, mixed sequential explor-
atory, explanatory or convergent parallel [41].


From this range of methodological options, in this research, the mixed
sequential exploratory method was chosen. Therefore, the research starts
with a qualitative data collection and analysis, after which, the results
obtained will be confirmed using a quantitative data analysis [42]. This
strategy intends to develop better measurements with
population-specific samples and confirm if data from some individuals
(in the qualitative phase) can be generalized to the quantitative phase
[40].


According to some authors, the main benefit of the mixed method-
ology is the possibility to collect qualitative and quantitative data [42]
using constructs, variables and concepts to obtain complementary in-
formation leading to greater certainty of results [40]. Thus, following
these principles, in this research, the qualitative data will be observed
from sources such as interviews, visual observations, documents and
records, among others. Similarly, quantitative data will be collected from
measuring instruments, observable checklists, numerical records, among
others [40].


3.1. The empirical context


The procedure for selecting production orders for follow-up and data
collection will be for convenience, as well as the selection of companies.


According to the objectives described above, supported by the Service
Science and guided by the pragmatic paradigm, the empirical EF once
conceptualized has to be confirmed in practical cases [42], as well as the
methodology which will identify the metrics, indicators and outcomes,
taking into account the objectives of this research.


In this sense, two groups of Portuguese OS companies were arranged,
selected objectively and conveniently. It is intended that each group
meets specific criteria, cumulative and, previously specified, based on the
comparison of the Innovation Outcomes: (i) G#T - is a group of ten
Portuguese OS companies still keep their operations in a traditional mode
which means no digital production machines in the shop-floor and
communicate with the market by phone and email only, and (ii) G#4.0 -
is another group of ten companies that since 2004 have been integrating
into their operations the technologies developed from the Mobilizer
Projects as described before and therefore, operate collaboratively with
BIM operators and the related digital marketplace. For these companies,
the production batch procedure, order selection for follow-up and data
collection was of convenience.


Focused on the research question and through the Empirical Frame-
work, this research compares the performance of these two groups of
Ornamental Stone companies by assessing the IO related to the Time-to-
Deliver their products.


Empirical data was collected mainly from observations on the factory
floor, written records and through interviews with the support of a script
of open questions. With this technique, which always implied a face-to-
face situation with the interviewee, a climate of relational approxima-
tion was created which favoured the free expression of knowledge,

3

attitudes and intentions by the interviewee, always recommended in
Social Sciences [43]. Thus, common perception and knowledge were the
basis for the elaboration of a more formalized and general “version of
reality” by social scientists [44].


All these selected companies were interviewed, following Morse’s
(1998) suggestions, namely meeting several criteria of a “good informer”
[45]. For this author, these can generically serve as significant basic se-
lection criteria [46].


The names of these companies, at the request of those responsible for
them, will not be disclosed in this work. However, by agreement with
their managers, there will be no limitations on the entry of academics for
observations, if it is for the same purposes of this research.


The EF conceptualized under the support of the Service Science has
followed the rules and philosophical principles of this emergent scientific
discipline [47], which means that the same rules were followed regard-
less of whether the companies belong to G#T and therefore with a
traditional business mindset or digital-oriented mindset and integrated
the G#4.0.

3.2. Qualitative data collection


The qualitative data represents non-quantifiable concerns such as
feelings, opinions or responses to an unstructured questionnaire repeated
at each one of the 36 steps of the service process Tables, 1,2,3, and 4).


To collect qualitative data related to the four main stakeholders
(customer, supplier, competition and authority), has been used: (i)
qualitative observations – such as shop floor notes related to the execu-
tion of orders, and openly observing the views of respondents; (ii)
qualitative interviews – such as questions asked directly to the stake-
holders’ human resources or by telephone, to obtain the views of re-
spondents; (iii) qualitative documents – such as digital or paper
documents, public or private, such as minutes of meetings, reports, letters
and e-mails, and finally (iv) audio and visual qualitative material – such
as qualitative audio and visual materials, photographs, physical products,
websites, e-mails, text messages, among others.


Thus, throughout the process of value co-creating, whenever it was
found that the qualitative result obtained in a given Step (i), regarding a
Concern (j) from a Stakeholder (k), favours the acceptance of the offer
discussed, the resulting Qualitative Concern Key Indicator (KCIQUAL-j-k-i),
was recorded as “U" (Upwards). Conversely, whenever the qualitative
outcome seems to go against the acceptance of the proposed bid, the
resulting KCIQUAL-j-k-i was recorded as “D" (Down). If at any stage (i) of
the service process, the result cannot be evaluated or becomes irrelevant
according to the interviewer’s interpretation, no data was recorded.


For each one of these four stakeholders, qualitative data maps were
recorded and fulfilled throughout the service process. In the (Tables 1–4)
was recorded the opinion (feelings) of the interviewer (researcher) based
on the concerns of the interviewee (interested party) together with the
observations of the shop floor, recorded in terms of two possible results.


To limit the impact of personal “feeling” on the results of the research,
the data collection had always the presence of both authors of this
research.

3.3. Quantitative data collection


The quantitative information represents the concerns of each stake-
holder, related to the numerical data, such as time, energy, number of
parts and costs, among others, throughout the 36 steps of the service
process [48]. These quantitative data have been collected from direct
measurements on production machines, computers, servers and data-
bases, measurements on the shop floor and direct measurements made
during site visits to the execution of the order (Tables 5 and 6). Quan-
titative data maps were prepared for each participant, filled in as the
service process takes place, for each order monitored and evaluated.

3.4. Customer Key Concern Indicators (KCIC)


For the empirical context of this research, stakeholder “Customer” are
collective entities that use the BIM to design, manage and monitor the
building construction operations, either in private or public sectors.
Mostly architects and engineers using a BIM station, these persons
represent the “resources with rights” resources of the service system

“customer” according to the S|S [49].
The Customer Concerns related to the Delivery-Time are represented


as KCIC and assessed through the Equations 1, 2 and 3 by using the data
collected.

collective entities that manufacture stone products for the construction
industry and sell directly to the end-users.


The Provider Concerns related to the Delivery-Time are represented
as KCIP and assessed through Equations (4)–(10), by using the data
collected.

3.6. Competitors Key Concern Indicators


For the empirical context of this research, the stakeholder “Compet-
itor” are collective entities that manufacture that compete directly or
indirectly with providers, either in terms of products or market
geography.


The Competitor Concerns related to the Delivery-Time are repre-
sented as KCICP and assessed through Equations (11) and (12) and by
using the data collected.

3.8. Innovation Outcomes (IO’s)


As observed in the literature, for S|S, when the interaction between
two service systems evolves the mode of its operation, it generates as
outputs the Innovation Outcomes [29]. Therefore, the IOqual-k and
IOquan-k (Equations (14) and (15)), represent the variation observed in
the KCIqual-k and KCIquan-k indicators, resulting from the innovations
along the service process [50]. For the EF, stakeholders’ concerns will be
qualified and quantified based on the right metrics for each of the
KCIQUAL and KCIQUAN, and so, it is possible to assess each result before
and after the innovation.


IOqualIJK ¼

KCIqualjkiðCurrent StateÞ
(14)


IOquanIJK ¼
½KCIquan jkiðCurrent StateÞ � KCIquan jkiðFuture StateÞ�


KCIquan jkiðCurrent StateÞ
(15)


If IOjki > 0, (i) it means the innovation impact tends to favour
acceptance of the value proposition; (ii) if IOjki < 0, it means the inno-
vation impact goes against acceptance of the value proposition and; (iii)
if IOjki ¼ 0, it means the innovation did not have any impact on the
acceptance of the value proposition.


As a key assumption of the mixed methodological approach, quali-
tative data and quantitative data must provide results that lead to similar
conclusions. In other words, by using the mixed methodology, if the re-
sults of the IOQUAL combined with the IOQUAN results are in the same
direction, they will be robust enough to conclude about the impact of I4.0
operations, on delivery times.


4. Confirmative study | framework empirical application


The qualitative and quantitative data were collected and recorded in
every step of the service process, either for the ten G#T companies and
for the ten G#4.0 companies monitored.


Following the methodological procedures, the data collected has been
used to compute either the indicators KCIqual-K, KCIquan-K and the out-
comes IOqual-K IOquan-K for each one of the main stakeholder (k), (Cus-
tomers, Suppliers, Competitors and Authorities), followed by their
discussion and evolution interpretation.


4.1. Customer qualitative KCI’s and IO’s


The customer concerns are represented by a set of data along every
step of the service process. From these data, the KCIqual-C have been

6

computed either for the G#T and the G#4.0 group of companies.
By using the Equations 1 and 2, we found that the KCIqual-C, have are


been reduced considerably, resulting in a positive IOqual-C (Equation
(13)), when the operations changes from G#T to the G#4.0.


4.2. Analysing in detail the IOqual-C related to customer concerns, we found
that the


KCI indexed to the “Time to Receive the Product” contributes to the
main impact on the delivery time (Table 7). This major gains in terms of
concerns reduction may be justified by the fact that in I4.0 mode (G#4.0
group of companies) the transparency and production efficiency tend to
increase when digital operations are used. Moreover, the permanent
collaboration of the customer during the whole service process in I4.0
mode of operations, puts pushes the provider to become more efficient.


Paradoxically, we found that from the customer perspective, I4.0 does
not increase the flexibility, which at first glance is counter-intuitive since
one of the challenges of I4.0 is to provide production flexibility. The
justification for this result may be related to the fact that all G#T com-
panies, despite manually or traditionally manufacturing but they provide
products customized, which is, in fact, one of their main competitive
advantages currently. Moreover, what the G#4.0 companies are
expecting from the digital operations is to keep their current flexibility
and additionally reduce the delivery time among other benefits.


4.3. Provider qualitative KCI’s and IOs


The provider concerns are represented by a set of data along every
step of the service process. From these data, the KCIqual-P has been
computed either for the G#T and the G#4.0 group of companies.


By using the Equations (4) and (5), we found that the KCIqual-P, have
are been reduced considerably (Table 8), resulting in a positive IOqual-P
(Equation (13)) when the operations change from G#T to the G#4.0.


4.4. Competitor qualitative KCI’s and IO’s


The Competitor concerns are represented by a set of data along every
step of the service process. From these data, the KCIqual-CP have been

By using the Equations (11) and (12), we found that the KCIqual-CP,
have are been reduced considerably (Table 9), resulting in a positive
IOqual-CP when the operations changes from G#T to the G#4.0 (see
Table 10).


4.5. Authority qualitative KCI’s and IO’s


The Authority concerns are represented by a set of data along every
step of the service process. From these data, the KCIqual-A have been
computed either for the G#T and the G#4.0 group of companies.


By using Equation (13), we found that the KCIqual-A, have are been
reduced (Table 9), resulting in a positive IOqual-A when the operations
changes from G#T to the G#4.0.

exploratory mixed methodological approach is that qualitative data and
quantitative data, while providing different types of information, taken
together must confirm the results, this being the main advantage of
mixed methodology.


Observing the IOquan-C, related to the Customer evolution of the
KCIquan-C (Table 11), we found a quantitative gain of 58% in the
PLTCQUAN-C, confirming the qualitative gains of 45% computed on the
previous section.


Observing the IOquan-P related to the Customer evolution of the KCI-
quan-P (Table 12), we found that the most significant gains (1,05 h/m2)
occurred during the first phase of the service process (Marketing Inter-
face Concerns), which appeared to happen as the result of easy and in-
tegrated collaborative operations between the I4.0 provider and the BIM
operator.


Moreover, we also found gains of 0,40 h/m2 in the “Production Cycle
Time Concerns”, of 0,33 h/m2 in the “Production Occupation Concerns”,
0,29 h/m2 in the “Production Layout Balance Concerns”, and 0,07 h/m2
in the “Logistics Capability Concerns”. These average quantitative gains
of 0,44h/m2, confirm the qualitative average gains of 74% found in the
previous section, according to the provider perspective (Chart 1).


5. Conclusions


Supported by the Service Science Body of Knowledge, in this research
we have found a possible answer about the impact of I4.0 operations, on
the time to deliver the products, of the traditional and fragmented sectors
in Digital Marketplace context.


For this assessment propose, an empirical framework (EF) was
conceptualized under the Service Science perspective and applied to a
case study related to the Portuguese Ornamental Stone sector. The case
study has involved twenty stone companies split into two groups of ten,
all of them, directly involved in the negotiation, production and delivery
of the orders monitored during this empirical research: (i) ten companies
operating traditionally, here designated as G#T operations context and,
(ii) ten other companies are using digital technologies since 2005 in their
operations and collaboratively work today with the BIM marketplace,
here designated as G#4.0 operations. During the empirical research,
orders’ follow-up, qualitative and quantitative data were collected, and
the normative nature of the ornamental stone was also observed in all

7

steps of the service process.
For Service Science perspective, each stakeholder expects and makes


a different assessment of the value of the proposals. Thus, for the EF
conceptualized, the concerns for stakeholders were defined in terms of
Key Concern Indicators (KCI) with which it was possible to measure the
concerns qualitatively and quantitatively and their evolution in the
shifting context, through qualitative and quantitative Innovation Out-
comes (IO), as defined by Service Science.


� From the Customers’ perspective, we found an average qualitative
customers’ concerns relief of 45%, confirmed by a quantitative
average relief of 58%.


� From the Competitors’ perspective, we found an average qualitative
gain of 71%.


� From the Authorities perspective, we found an average qualitative
gain of 62%.


� From the Providers’ perspective, we found an average qualitative gain
of 74%, confirmed by a quantitative average relief of 0,44h/m2.


From these results, we may conclude that for the traditional and
fragmented sectors in the digital marketplace context, may reduce the
time to deliver their products if they shift the operations to Industry 4.0.
Without considering the important investment component required to
purchase these technologies, since the impact of the I4.0 on their
response to the threats arising from the digital procurement is technically
positive, it is recommendable to the traditional and fragmented com-
panies to integrate these technologies on their operations. We may also
conclude that the empirical framework, conceptualized according to
Service Science Theory was appropriate for the research problem
addressed in this research, allowing the combination of qualitative and
quantitative data in an exploratory way, and enabling robust conclusions
to be drawn about the response of stone companies in different opera-
tional contexts, resulting in a research contribution of this work to
practice.


Although the proposed objectives have been broadly achieved, there
were several difficulties to overcome during this research, which led to
some limitations. Monitoring the entire sequence of events from the
discussion of orders to delivery of the products to customers was another
difficulty found in this research since a great amount of data occurred
simultaneously and in different geographical locations. The difficulty in
identifying competitors who were “competing” for the same orders was
perhaps the most difficult task during the data collection process since
directly asking potential competitors if they were competing for the

orders monitored would mean passing on information from the providers
with whom the researcher was committed to confidentiality. Ornamental
Stones are natural raw materials and therefore their natural variability
cannot be avoided. To minimize this unavoidable situation, orders using
the same stone type were selected, but even so, the physical-chemical
characteristics may not have been the same in all the orders moni-
tored, resulting in limited reliability of some of the data collected.
Finally, another limitation is related to the state-of-the-art BIM software
releases available in the market [51].
