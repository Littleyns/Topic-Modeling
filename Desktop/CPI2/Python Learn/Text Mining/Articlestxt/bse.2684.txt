Abstract


Despite the increasing interest in green innovation literature, little is known on how


and under what conditions firms' knowledge transfer activities affect green innova-


tion. There is lack of research that on how particular organizational capabilities are


seen more useful and how it influences on green innovation performance. To address


this research gap, we examine a mediation model in which we explore whether a


firm's knowledge acquisition capability and investment in environmental manage-


ment mediate the impact of buyer-driven knowledge transfer activities on green


product innovation and green process innovation. On the basis of an analysis of a


sample of 239 manufacturing firms, we find that buyer-driven knowledge activities


have a greater positive impact on green product innovation than green process inno-


vation. Investment in environmental management fully mediates the relationship


between buyer-driven knowledge transfer activities and green process innovation,


and knowledge acquisition capability partially mediates the relationship between


buyer-driven knowledge transfer activities and green product innovation. The current


study provides evidence that internal competencies and the role of buyers in knowl-


edge transfer are critical for explaining the green product innovation and green pro-


cess innovation. Our results suggest that buyer involvement pushes firms to develop


resource acquisition capability to enhance green product innovation. Our results also


highlight the importance of investment in environmental management for overcom-


ing the environmental challenges in the manufacturing firms.

1 | INTRODUCTION


Green innovation is a highly prevalent phenomenon that provides


firms with the opportunity to reduce their negative impact on the


environment. It enables the development of product and production


processes that are less harmful to the natural environment (Huang &


Li, 2017). As a consequence of environmental concerns, the


manufacturing industry has geared its efforts towards the


implementation of green innovation for reducing energy, pollution,


recycling of ease, and utilization of remanufactured materials


(Dangelico, Pujari, & Pontrandolfo, 2017). The adoption and integra-


tion of green innovation have contributed to creating more revenue


opportunities and reducing environmental impact, among multina-


tional enterprises such as Unilever, Ikea, Nike, Whole Foods, and Tesla


(Williams, 2015). Green product innovation (GPdI) and green process


innovation (GPcI) have provided abundant opportunities to firms for

mobilizing resources to safeguard the natural environment and


encourage prosperity. Evidence suggests that GPdI and GPcI have the


potential to tackle environmental-related problems (Chen, 2008). As


such, both GPdI and GPcI are increasingly important phenomena that


have the potential to make a distinct contribution to environmental


sustainability.


However, despite the relevance of green innovation as an enabler


of environmental sustainability, the identification of investment


decisions in technology and environmental management practices in


relation to green innovation has received little attention in the litera-


ture (Guoyou, Saixing, Chiming, Haitao, & Hailiang, 2013). Moreover,


although previous studies recognize the role of customer and supplier


collaboration (Hofman, Blome, Schleper, & Subramanian, 2020) and


managerial concern (Tang, Walsh, Lerner, Fitza, & Li, 2018) in green


innovation, there is little evidence on the role of firm competencies to


develop and create GPdI (Chen, 2008). Likewise, relatively very little


is known about the extent to which internal firm internal capabilities


influence on GPdI and GPcI (Melander, 2017).


Recent studies highlighted the importance of absorptive capacity


in the adoption of external knowledge for GPdI (Zhang, Liang, Feng,


Yuan, & Jiang, 2020). Similarly, the role of customer pressure and


buyer involvement as drivers of GPdI and GPcI has recently been


noted (Walker et al., 2014; Zhang & Zhu, 2019). Still, a much-debated


question is whether foreign buyer involvement can enhance GPdI and


GPcI (Guoyou et al., 2013). While extant research has investigated the


antecedents of green innovation, including learning and capabilities


(Albort-morant, Leal-millán, & Cepeda-carrión, 2016) and customer


pressure and organizational learning (Zhang & Zhu, 2019), few empiri-


cal research studies have broadened the scope to consider specific


dimensions of buyer involvement, such as buyer-driven knowledge


transfer activities, especially in conjunction with absorptive capacity


for the GPdI and GPcI (Dangelico, 2016). Therefore, empirical


research on the role of buyer knowledge affects firms' GPdI, and GPcI


still needs to be investigated (Guoyou et al., 2013).


To address the identified research gaps, this study aims to exam-


ine a mediation model in which we explore whether a firm's knowl-


edge acquisition capability (KAC) and investment in environmental


management (IEM) mediate the impact of buyer-driven knowledge


transfer activities (BDKTAs) on GPdI and GPcI. Given the potential


benefits of GPdI and GPcI to reduce firms' environmental impact, this


study undertakes to understand how firm capabilities are affected by


external knowledge (Melander, 2017). We hypothesize that BDKTAs


reflected in their effect on KAC and IEM, consequently effects on


GPdI and GPcI. The above linkage is in line with a mediation model


wherein KAC and IEM serve mediators between BDKTAs and GPdI


and GPcI. This research addresses the following research questions:


(1) What effect do BDKTAs have on green product and process inno-


vation? (2) How firms choose specific internal capabilities to respond


to BDKTAs and enhance green product and process innovation?


In addressing our research questions and testing the hypotheses,


we used partial least square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM).


A sample of 239 manufacturing firms in Pakistan was targeted as our


sample for two main reasons. First, Pakistan, as an emerging global


manufacturer, plays an essential role in international markets. Second,


manufacturing firms in Pakistan have been accelerating their green


innovation because foreign customers have demanded more stringent


requirements for green innovation.


This study makes contributions to green innovation research by


describing how KAC and IEM can be used to predict GPdI and GPcI.


First, we expand the finding grounded in absorptive capacity.


According to Zahra and George (2002), the extent to which firm


resources are assimilated and exploited depends considerably on prior


related knowledge, which can support a firm in applying knowledge to


strengthen GPdI (Song, Yang, Zeng, & Feng, 2020). Here, we extracted


a viewpoint that GPdI has a relationship with BDKTAs. In this vein,


our results suggest that KAC channels the role of BDKTAs in enhanc-


ing GPdI. Second, our research contributes to the relative lack of


empirical evidence on the nature of the link between KAC and GPcI


(Melander, 2018). We advance the knowledge on the green innova-


tion by explicating the role of IEM as a linking pin between KAC


and GPcI.


Further, our result shows that internal investment in the environ-


ment enhances the firm GPcI. Although previous research has


suggested that external knowledge adoption is associated with


improved firm GPdI and GPcI (Zhao, Feng, & Shi, 2018), little or no


research has examined the influence of BDKTAs on GPdI and GPcI.


We emphasize that BDKTAs may expand the base of knowledge,


expertise, and resources form, which firm can enhance their internal


capability to process resources and affectively enhance GPdI


and GPcI.


The study is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the litera-


ture review and the conceptual framework. Section 3 describes the


research methodology, sample, and measures taken for this study.


Section 4 presents the data analysis and results. Section 5 discusses


the results, findings, conclusion, and finally, presents research implica-


tions, future research, and limitations.


2 | HYPOTHESES DEVELOPMENT


One of the basic characteristics that allow firms to reduce global


warming is generating green products and process innovation (Arnold,


2017). Green innovation consists of two main activities. GPdI entails


the generation of advanced products involving less harmful material,


improved packaging, and the use of recycling and remanufactured


parts and components. GPcI involves the firm propensity to improve


the production process, saving and prevent pollution, and use less


energy consumption (Chen & Chen, 2008).


In addition to internal research and development for knowledge


creations, the sources of knowledge outside the firms have been shown


to impact product and process innovation (Frenz & Ietto-gillies, 2009).


Forés and Camisón (2016) found that a firm's innovation performance


relies on external and internal knowledge sources to reduce environ-


mental impact and improve energy efficiency. While, Arvanitis, Lokshin,


Mohnen, and Wörter (2015) have identified that customer knowledge


is important for the firms pursuing innovation. Many scholars have


2 AWAN ET AL.






reported that external knowledge resources positively contribute to


supplier innovation performance improvements (Xie, Zou, & Qi, 2018).


Likewise, Ter, Criscuolo, and Salter (2017) believe that external knowl-


edge sources are essential for innovation performance.


Interorganizational knowledge transfer is a fundamental source


of different types of innovations (Gölgeci, Ferraris, Arslan, &


Tarba, 2019; Tsai, 2001). Though knowledge transfer is typically recip-


rocal, buyers or suppliers may be the driving force behind it. In this


regard, BDKTAs have received particular attention as a means of


supplier development and innovative performance (Kim, Hur, &


Schoenherr, 2015). BDKTAs denote buyers' initiatives to support their


suppliers through interorganizational knowledge transfer. BDKTAs


provide an opportunity for enhancing the firm's development and


performance (Kim et al., 2015). We expect these opportunities


provided by BDKTAs could be extended to green innovation.


Relationship with buyers is considered a crucial means of knowl-


edge transfer and development (Saliola & Zanfei, 2009). External


knowledge acquisition from key partners, that is, buyers, may have a


significant impact on the development and the generation of novel


ideas Liao and Marsillac (2015). Existing literature on green innovation


usually states that adsorptive capacity that leverages external


knowledge sources is beneficial for the integration of knowledge


(Rixiao, Juanru, Yajiong, & Huigang, 2020). Laursen and Salter (2006)


also show that the firm's external knowledge sources are significant in


shaping a firm's propensity for green innovation. This suggests that


the generation of new insights from key buyers could help firms to


successfully improve and design environment friendly packaging and


the use of cleaner production technologies to save energy and water


resources. Thus, we expect the following:


Hypothesis 1. Buyer-driven knowledge transfer activities are


positively related to green product innovation.


Hypothesis 2. Buyer-driven knowledge transfer activities are


positively related to green process innovation.


Buyer-driven knowledge is an important means through which


the firm brings improvements in the products and processes. That


said, buyer-driven knowledge needs to be internalized and utilized


through the acquirer firms' own capabilities. As a strategic capability


related to absorptive capacity, KAC refers to the extent to which firms


are able to systemize the process of extracting, structuring, and orga-


nizing external information (Chen, 2004). Knowledge acquisition has


been linked with absorptive capacity and specific investment (Li,


Cui, & Liu, 2017). Given the importance and nature of external knowl-


edge acquisition, previous research has suggested that knowledge


acquisition does not always lead to improve innovation performance


(Su, Tsang, & Peng, 2009). Contrary to this notion, Zhang, Shu, Jiang,


and Malter (2010) suggested that acquisition of knowledge may


improve the prospects for innovation.


The theoretical lens of absorptive capacity was widely used in


previous research on improving the green innovation performance


(Carlo, Lyytinen, & Rose, 2012; Liao, Wu, Hu, & Tsuei, 2009). The


firms can develop absorptive capacity by implementing a knowledge


acquisition strategy or through external sources (Cohen &


Levinthal, 1990; Forés & Camisón, 2016). In absorptive capacity litera-


ture, a firm can create cooperative strategies for knowledge acquisi-


tion and captured additional value by transforming them across the


firm (Mariano & Walter, 2015). Absorptive capacity can help firms to


acquire knowledge (Li et al., 2017). However, empirically, literature


generally supports the view that firms' internal capabilities are essen-


tial to enhance green innovation (Li, 2015).


Furthermore, KAC is argued to facilitate innovation performance


(Lee, Johnson, & Grewal, 2008). Previous research has recognized that


knowledge acquisition may a substantial impact on innovation (Liao &


Marsillac, 2015). We posit that firms with higher KAC are flexible to


accumulate and renew available knowledge, reduce environmental


impact, and improve energy efficiency through the use of recycling


approaches and prevent pollution from the manufacturing process.


Combining our arguments derived from absorptive capacity, we sug-


gest that there is a mediation relationship between KAC between


BDKTAs and GPdI. When partners provide expertise, capabilities to


develop new products and information, a firm can shape this knowl-


edge that can stimulate to development of innovative green products.


We argue that KAC may mediate the impact of BDKTAs on GPdI.


Thus, we posit the following:


Hypothesis 3. Knowledge acquisition capability mediates the effect


of buyer-driven knowledge transfer activities on green product


innovation.


As a result of greenhouse gas emissions, many firms have adopted


environmentally responsible practices into their operations and pro-


grams (Awan, 2019). Many of these environmentally responsible prac-


tices entail substantial investments with important implications for


the investing firms. Such environmental investments are reflected in


the level of resources invested in environmental initiatives and the


form of those investments across different types of environmental


technologies/processes (Klassen & Vachon, 2003). As such, IEM


represents increasing levels of investment in environmental technolo-


gies and the shift away from mere pollution control towards the sig-


nificant reduction of ecological footprint, which requires the overhaul


of existing production paradigms and major product and process inno-


vations (Klassen & Vachon, 2003).


The growth of IEM has been recognized among researchers and


practitioners (Power, Klassen, Kull, & Simpson, 2015). This is in line


with Busch, Bauer, and Orlitzky (2016), who adopt the perspective of


sustainable development: Responsible social investment is the


attempt to express, and possibly promote, specific ethical values have


a great positive effect on sustainable performance. Buyer firm support


to suppliers is associated with on-site supplier consulting, supplier


evaluation, and working collaboratively on new product development.


Export manufacturing firms in a developing country are likely to


have participated in joint decision making and development of


technology. Empirical evidence suggests that environmental invest-


ments encourage firms to protect the natural environment


AWAN ET AL. 3






(Chatzitheodorou, Skouloudis, Evangelinos, & Nikolaou, 2019) and are


a critical source of product and process innovation (Womack &


Jones, 2005). IEM programs are strategically crucial for the develop-


ment of infrastructure and improvement of the production process


(Pagell, Krumwiede, & Sheu, 2007).


According to Claro, Neto, and Oliveira Claro (2013), sustainable


investment refers to investment made in economic, environmental, and


social dimensions. Previous research examined that investment in envi-


ronmental programs may bring more relevance to support clean produc-


tion (Ortas, Burritt, & Moneva, 2013). Power et al. (2015) suggested


that IEM enabled firms to shift the production process towards waste


reduction. This study describes IEM as an investment aimed to solve


effectively social and environmental challenges and create a long-term


sustainable value creation for most of the people and society. Specifi-


cally, the buyer promotes manufacturers to develop infrastructure as


well as cooperation for joint problem solving and process improvement


for investment decisions in the advanced recycling process, health, and


safety issues. In turn, we expect IEM channels the influence of BDKTAs


on GPcI. As such, we seek to explain how BDKTAs promote firms' IEM,


which may generate novel ideas and solutions for the implementation


of GPcI. This suggests that IEM may mediate the relationship between


BDKTAs and GPcI. Therefore, we propose the following:


Hypothesis 4. Investment in environmental management mediates


the effect of buyer-driven knowledge transfer activities on


green process innovation.


Figure 1 summarizes the formulated hypotheses, generated on


the current literature, in a conceptual framework.


3 | RESEARCH METHODOLOGY


3.1 | Data collection


The empirical analysis is based on data collected through a survey


questionnaire of senior managers from different manufacturing firms,


such as sports goods manufacturers, surgical equipment manufac-


turers, leather goods, textiles, and other industrial firms. Manufac-


turers from the developing country were chosen because they are


likely to deal with different types of buyers. We pilot tested question-


naires to reduce item complexity and minimize ambiguity. Finally, the


final draft questionnaire was then pretested to 17 randomly selected


firms, and these firms were excluded from the final survey. We ran-


domly identified manufacturers' firms located in different parts of the


country from a list obtained from the chamber of commerce and


industry. We sent questionnaires to 650 firms to senior managers.


The survey was conducted in a span of 3 months, from March to May


2017. A cover letter was attached, explaining the purpose of the sur-


vey and ensure respondents' confidentiality. We received 257 useable


returns, out of which 18 responses could not be included due to miss-


ing values in the final data analysis, thus resulting in 239 valid


response and a response rate of 36.1%. This response rate is adequate


for self-administered questionnaires, where response rates generally


vary between 30 to 45% (Zhao, Feng, & Shi, 2018).


The respondents were selected using a simple random sampling


method. Pakistan is an interesting context for studying the supplier's


involvement with buyers related to the development of green prod-


ucts. Pakistan is situated in the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor


and is increasingly regarded as a major emerging economy. Likewise,


firms in Pakistan are increasingly becoming more integrated into


global supply chains with key lead firms that support their develop-


ment and increasing knowledge flow between buyers and suppliers


(Bhutta, Rana, & Asad, 2007). On the other hand, the country faces


pressing sustainability challenges that require major GPdI and GPcI


(Ali et al., 2019; Lund-Thomsen, Nadvi, Chan, Khara, & Xue, 2012).


Thus, Pakistan was deemed a proper context for testing our research


hypotheses.


The survey was targeted at the seminar managers of the sample


industry. The demographic characteristics of the sample are presented


in (Table A1), suggested that they account for a broad range of indus-


tries. We also examined the convergent validity of the subject mea-


sures. We incorporated control variables into our data analysis. We


used industry type, firm age, and employee experience because it

could likely act as a source of variation on green process and product


innovation outcomes. Firm size was measured with the number of


employees. To avoid multicollinearity in testing the hypotheses, we


used a log of the number of employees. Previous studies provide evi-


dence that firm age will assist the firm to gain more knowledge on


innovation from the external environment and to identify new oppor-


tunities (Zhang & Zhu, 2019), so we controlled the firm age by taking


a log of a number of years a firm is in the industry. The t-test result is


insignificant, suggesting no significant differences between firm age,


firm size, and industry type. We find nonresponse bias by comparing


late and early respondents regarding industry type and size of the


firm. The findings show no statistical difference between the two


groups at a .05 level of significance. Furthermore, the result of equal-


ity of variance also supports at P > .05, indicating the assumption of


the equality of variance between late respondents, and early has not


been violated (Armstrong & Overton, 1977).


3.2 | Common method variance


We assess the common method variance (CMV) following (Podsakoff,


MacKenzie, Lee, & Podsakoff, 2003) approach. We measured all our


variables on a 7-point Likert scale. This helps to reduce the possibility


of respondents' specific answer patterns (Zhang, Ma, Wang, Li, &


Huo, 2016). Our survey questionnaires consist of multiple items, and


there is a low possibility of bias occurred at the construct level that


measures at the item level. Second, we employed Harmon's one-


factor test. The results show that a single factor catches at most 4.7%


of the variance. The result suggests that CMV is not prevalent in the


chosen variables. Third, the involvement of the mediation effect as


the focus of the study, it is unlikely that respondents theorized the


proposed relationships while responding to the survey questionnaires


(Brockner, Siegel, Daly, Tyler, & Martin, 1997). We also performed


principal component analysis on all the factors; results revealed that


all items loaded on their corresponding variable indicate the absence


of CMB (Podsakoff & Organ, 1986).


3.3 | Measures and scale development


Multiple-item scales were used to operationalize the key variables in


this study (Table A2). We drew all the measure items and scales from


the prior research studies and modified within the research context.


To operationalize the scale of measures, we followed the process rec-


ommended by Churchill (1979).


3.3.1 | Buyer-driven knowledge transfer activities


A scale of BDKTAs is measured by the extent to which the firm has


been involved with its buyers from the last 3 years. The BDKTAs is


measured as the extent to which the supplier has received support


from different buyers over the past 3 years. We adapted the scales


items from (Krause & Ellram, 1997; Modi & Mabert, 2007). We used


the BDKTAs scale, which has been used frequently in prior research


(Awan, Khattak, Rabbani, & Dhir, 2020; Kim et al., 2015).


3.3.2 | Green product and process innovation


We used 7-point Likert scale items and asked respondents to indicate


the extent to which green product/process innovation improved from


the last 3 years. Adapted from Chen (2008) and Chen, Lai, and


Wen (2006), “green product innovation” (GPdI) and “green process


innovation” (GPcI) were measured with four items. Following previous


studies, GPdI and GPdI are measured on a 7-point Likert scale.


3.3.3 | Knowledge acquisition capabilities


Knowledge acquisition capabilities (KAC) is measured to the extent to


which the firm has been involved with buyers and acquired knowl-


edge resources over 3 years. We drew these items and measures from


prior research. These were measured using the 4-item scales adapted


by Lynn, Skov, and Abel (1999) following context adaptions.


3.3.4 | Investment in environmental management


IEM consists of the production process improvement and information


on customers' needs on innovation issues. IEM was operationalized


form the work of Pagell et al. (2007). IEM is measured with four items:


investment in functional and process, safety practices, recycling of


materials, and waste management. IEM is measured to what extent the


firm has invested resources in programs over the period of 3 years on a


7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (to a great extent).


3.4 | Results and analysis


Table 1 depicts the descriptive statistics analysis, which provides the


magnitude of correlations between the dependent and independent


variables. We tested the hypothesized model using smart PLS (PLS


3.0) (Ringle, Wende, & Becker, 2015). PLS is a well-established tech-


nique in management researchers (Henseler, Hubona, & Ray, 2016).


This technique provides better results in predictive and explanatory


research. Factor loading of all items and average variance extracted


(AVE) up above the suggested criteria support convergent validity


(Fornell & Larcker, 1981). Our results meet the criteria of discriminant


validity, as AVE is greater than the corresponding square multiple cor-


relations between the measures of the constructs.


The discriminant and construct validity are evaluated following


criteria described by Fornell and Larcker (1981). Table 2 reports the


overall model assessment. We analyze the significant effect sizes of


the relationship between the construct by considering “Cohen's effect


size“ (f2). We use Stone-Geisser's Q² evaluation criterion for the


AWAN ET AL. 5






cross-validated predictive relevance of the PLS path model (Hair &


Hult, 2016). The results reported in Table 2 reveal that all composite


reliability values exceeded 0.70 (Nunnally & Bernstein, 1994). The


R-square value ranges of all construct illustrate by the model are


24.7% for knowledge acquisition and 20.4% for sustainable invest-


ment. The coefficient of determination (R2) measures predictive accu-


racy and indicates the construct reliability (Hair & Hult, 2016).


The strength of the exogenous variable is measured by the


effect size, where values 0.289, 0.327 and 0.256 indicate relatively


medium influence, respectively (Cohen, 1992). To detect an effect


size, at a .05 level of significance, requires a minimum of a sample


of 92 respondents. The value of Q2 is an appropriate criterion for


determining predictive relevance for the constructs (Henseler


et al., 2014). We observed that the blindfold technique produces


value Q2 > 0 for KAC, IEM, and SP at 0.012, 0.123, and 0.317,


respectively. The result highlighted that the model has a powerful


predictive capacity in connection to the endogenous constructs


(Hair & Hult, 2016). Table 3 depicts the analysis of effect size.


Further, we used Heterotrait–Monotrait (HTMT) ratios to deter-


mine the discriminant validity. Following, HTMT ratios are all less


than the cut of score 0.84 (Henseler, Ringle, & Sarstedt, 2015).


The HTMT rations are below 0.90, indicating the discriminant


reliability of the construct.


4 | RESULT ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSION


We employed PLS with a bootstrapping procedure to obtain path


coefficients. The results show a significant positive relationship


between BDKTAs and GPdI (β = .239, t = 8.56, P = .05). Thus, H1


receives supports. The impact of BDKTAs on GPcI is positive and


significant (β = .272, t = .092, P = .05); H2 is supported. The findings,

therefore, suggest that BDKTAs will probably allow enhancing green


innovation in product recycling, remanufacturing and reuse of mate-


rial, and the use of cleaner production technologies to improve energy


efficiency and save water and pollution sources. We suggest that


green innovation is achieved when buyer-driven knowledge practices


are part of the firm overall strategy. Participatory approaches are of


clear importance. We used Baron and Kenny's (1986)) approach to


test the mediation hypotheses. Further, to assess whether there is a


partial or full mediation occurred, we consider Preacher and


Hayes' (2008)) and MacKinnon, Fairchild, and Fritz's (2007)) guidelines


to test the full or partial mediation.


Hypothesis 3 predicts that KAC mediates between BDKTAs and


GPdI, as Table 4 showed. The total effect of BDKTAs on GPdI is posi-


tive and significant (β = .239, P = .05), satisfying the (Baron &


Kenny, 1986) Condition 1. The results show a significant relationship


exist between BDKTAs and KAC (β = .248, P < .05). The findings


satisfying Baron and Kenny's (1986) condition 2. Moreover, KAC is


positively associated with GPdI (β = .181, P < .05). Consistent with the


expectations, we find a statistically significant relationship between


the effects of BDKTAs on KAC, as shown in Table 4. The result of


Preacher and Hayes (2008) test at 95% confidence interval


(CI) (0.0012, 0.0554) was significant. The result indicated that the


direct effect (c0) remains consistent after introducing mediating vari-


ables. The findings indicate a positive association between KAC and


GPdI. Most importantly, when mediation was introduced in the model,


the findings provide evidence that partial mediation has occurred.


Therefore, H3 is supported. Our findings are also consistent with Liao


and Marsillac (2015), who found that resource acquisition influences


GPcI. This suggests that a firm may benefit from BDKTAs in its effort


to pursue GPdI. Hypothesis 4 predicts that IEM mediates the effects


of BDKTAs on GPcI. The total effect of BDKTAs on GPcI is positive


and significant (β = .153, P = .05; Table 4). Furthermore, as shown in


Table 4, after introducing the IEM as a mediator between BDKTAs


and GPcI, the direct effect is reduced and insignificant at 95% CI


(−0.0854, 0.1357), a full mediation concluded. The findings are consis-


tent with recent findings that investment decisions are positively


associated with the improvement of GPcI (Silva, Gomes, &


Sarkis, 2019). Our results highlight the importance of IEM for over-


coming the environmental challenges in the manufacturing firms.


5 | DISCUSSION


Green innovation is fast becoming an imperative and instrumental


source of environmental sustainability. Firms are compelled to


enhance their green innovation activities and outcomes to address


pressing environmental challenges and alleviate their environmental


footprint. However, green innovation may be a challenging


knowledge-intensive undertaking with many unknowns and compli-


cated features. There is a lack of research on how particular knowl-


edge resources are seen more useful and how it influences on green


innovation performance. Therefore, a better understanding of


enablers of key dimensions of green innovation, namely, green prod-


uct and process innovation, is essential.


In this study, we investigated the effect of BDKTAs on GPdI and


GPcI through resource acquisition capability (KAC) and IEM. First, the


current study provides evidence that internal competencies and the


role of buyers in knowledge transfer are critical for explaining the


GPdI and GPcI. Second, manufacturing firms need to develop an


absorptive capacity that enables them to assimilate knowledge from


the buyers. This study, therefore, theoretically and empirically sub-


stantiates that BDKTAs do affect KAC and IEM. Third, consistent with

the literature, this study provides evidence that IEM indirectly


improves process innovation, which provides distinct evidence to sup-


port the importance of BDKTAs for GPcI. Fourth, the findings suggest


that KAC is a critical enabler of GPdI because the role of buyers in


knowledge transfer activities can support the absorption of knowl-


edge required for developing new green products.


In short, the finding implies that green innovation activities


primarily require KAC to manage effectively external and existing


knowledge resources as well as IEM to manage both green product


and process innovation. We, accordingly, conclude that BDKTAs, that


is, research and development, participating in employee training and


skills, on-site visits, and joint problem solving, enhance the ability of


suppliers to make investments in waste reduction, pollution preven-


tion, and recycling of materials to pursue GPcI.


5.1 | Theoretical implications


The results of this research showed that KAC and IEM positively


explain a firm's GPdI and GPcI, respectively. The findings of this study


offer the following theoretical contributions to research on the


absorptive capacity that is widely considered a critical source for


knowledge assimilation and processing and apply it in a way to


strengthen GPdI (Albort-Morant et al., 2016). First, we expand the


findings grounded in absorptive capacity. According to Zahra and


George (2002), the extent to which firm resources are assimilated and


exploited depends considerably on prior related knowledge, which


can support a firm in applying knowledge to strengthen GPdI (Song


et al., 2020). We advance the absorptive capacity research by propos-


ing a conceptualization of firm internal knowledge-related capabilities


(i.e., KAC) in relation to GPdI. We extract a viewpoint that GPdI has a


relationship with resource acquisition.


Our results suggest that BDKTAs enable firms to develop KAC to


enhance GPdI. Given the widely accepted notion that buyer involve-


ment is key to GPdI, our study illustrates the importance of the role of


buyer knowledge in the development of absorptive capacity and sub-


sequent improvement of GPdI. Here, our results are in line with the


previous studies that provide evidence that through buyers' involve-


ment in knowledge transfer and better absorptive capacity, a supplier


firm can better pursue GPdI (Zhang et al., 2020).


Second, our research contributes to the relative lack of empirical


evidence that tests the role of internal capabilities in the linkage


between BDKTAs and green innovation (Melander, 2018). Although


previous research has suggested that external knowledge adoption is


associated with improved firm GPdI and GPcI (Zhao, Feng, &


Shi, 2018), little or no research has examined the influence of BDKTAs


on GPdI and GPcI. Accordingly, this study broadens our understanding


of the influence of BDKTAs on firms GPdI and GPcI.


Third, our findings contribute to green innovation literature by


bringing to the fore of understanding the environmental investment


strategy for firm GPcI and environmental sustainability (Cubas-Diaz &


Martinez Sedano, 2018). A few research efforts have investigated the


environmental investment impact on green performance outcomes


(Wu & Li, 2020). Here, our findings advance the extant research by


revealing how IEM facilitates the role of BDKTAs in GPdI (Zhao,


Feng, & Shi, 2018). The results suggest that the impact of BDKTAs on


green process innovation is mediated by the investment in environ-


mental management. Specifically, the study shows how investment in


environmental management is used to achieve green process


innovation.


5.2 | Managerial implications


This study also has implications for managers. First, our results show


the importance of a firm's involvement with its buyers and supply


chain partners in facilitating green innovation (Zhao et al., 2018). Man-


ufacturers should start with a focus on assimilation and creation of


knowledge resources, as beneficial forces behind innovations, to


enhance their GPdI and GPcI. The buyer knowledge transfer activities


may encourage supplier firms to explore novel and useful ideas (Awan


et al., 2020).


Second, we find that the more buyer involvement in a firm's


research and development and training initiatives, the better it is for


its GPcI. Likewise, we find that firms that invest more in environmen-


tal management are in a better position to leverage knowledge oppor-


tunities and support their GPcI. Thus, managers of the firms should be


made aware of the importance of environmental investment


(Cubas-Diaz & Martinez Sedano, 2018), which could boost GPcI, as


driven by BDKTAs. According to the results obtained, IEM is essential


for GPcI, which is essential to achieve goals and targets of firm sus-


tainability objectives.


Finally, our results show that knowledge acquisition and invest-


ment in the environment require buyer collaboration to achieve


the targets of decreasing emissions in manufacturing and strengthen


the ability of firms to reduce their environmental impact. Thus, with


the help of external changes agents, a firm is more effective in stimu-


lating investment if actively involved in search of resources and the


implementation of change initiatives for steering more pathways


(Hoppmann, Sakhel, & Richert, 2018). According to the findings, KAC,


such as acquired knowledge in the production process, social initia-


tives to develop new products, cleaner production processes, and


shared ownership vision, could reduce toxic materials and decrease


material consumptions and retrieval components from the end of life


products. Hence, managers should focus on external knowledge


resources and better leveraging knowledge transfer activities initiated


by their key buyers that are central to the development of their com-


petences in the pursuit of green innovation.


5.3 | Limitations and future research


This study is coupled with some limitations. First, one limitation of this


study is collected data from different manufacturing firms. Future


researchers could target survey questionnaires to multiple respon-


dents in a single firm. Second, this study particularly focuses on the


8 AWAN ET AL.






role of buyers in a particular context, that is, green innovation. Future


research studies should explore the influence of the top management


with a focus on social and managerial capital perspective on a firm's


environmental investment strategy on firm green innovations. Future


research could assess the mechanism through which firm


sustainability-orientation capability, green absorptive capacity, and


research and investment decision affect firm sustainable innovation


and financial performance. Our research has primarily collected data


from a developing country. Future research can replicate this model


and investigate the effect of broader involvement of third-tier sup-


pliers and green absorptive capacity on the firm implementation of cir-


cular economy initiatives. Green innovation is increasingly attracting


the attention of scholars and practitioners; yet, circular economy ini-


tiatives have not become a priority for sustainable product design in


the global industries. Scholars are realizing the urgency of actions for


circular economy initiatives aiming to reduce the adverse impacts of


climate change on society and increase business performance. Invest-


ment in sustainable product design is one of the effective and sustain-


able approaches to deal with the rapidly increasing climate issues to


support ongoing circular economy initiatives. Future research could


investigate how big data management capabilities affect on the circu-


lar economy performance in the perspective of industry4.0. Third,


because our study focuses on the cross-sectional method, we col-


lected data only from key informants, and a single point of time con-


strains our capacity to establish causality. Further research could


validate the findings by using alternative research design and data


collection.


Our study examines the impact of internal organizational capabili-


ties on green products and innovation. Circular economy initiatives


and their effects on innovative product development have been a hot


subject of researchers in the field of innovation management litera-


ture. Future research may investigate how digital transformation


capabilities may impact the organization's readiness for change and its


impact on innovation performance and circular economy performance.


There is a lack of studies on how industry 4.0 tools (for example, big


data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence) impact on innovation


performance. Our study documented that BDKTAs is essential for


GPdI. Future research may examine how team design thinking and


sharing economy influence environmental performance, as well as


how team agile team innovation process moderates the impact of


strategic orientation on sustainable business model design.


Finally, despite the progress made in explaining the importance of


the external source of knowledge transfer practices, an in-depth


understanding of firm internal capabilities and external networks of


existing partners is still limited (Laursen & Salter, 2006). Thus, future


research can delve deeper into the interplay between internal and


external sources of knowledge transfer in support of environmental


sustainability.
