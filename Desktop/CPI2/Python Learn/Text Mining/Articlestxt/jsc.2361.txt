Abstract


Industry 4.0 is a relevant subject both in academia and practice. Organizations need


systems for managing technologies and to understand how they can be essential for


business strategy. The requirements of software development include points that


must be discussed at a strategic level to create institutional value. Systematics that


integrate technology, and theory will influence the organization's strategic decisions.


Keywords: industry 4.0, software development, systematic proposal, technology

1 | INTRODUCTION


Smart industry and industry 4.0 are crucial keywords for the develop-


ments in manufacturing systems (Longo, Nicoletti, & Padovano, 2017).


The capabilities of digital solutions/tools have opened new opportuni-


ties and created ambitious challenges for manufacturing systems. In


recent years, these technological advances have motivated the indus-


tries, companies, and even governments to seek an improved alignment


between strategic objectives and technology management through the


application of structured and flexible approaches using techniques such


as technology road-mapping (TRM) (Carvalho, Fleury, & Lopes, 2013).


The basic principle of industry 4.0 is the core of the so-called


Internet of things and manufacturing interfaces (R. Lopez, 2014):


Products in progress and production machines that will collect and


share data in real-time. This technology leads to a shift from central-


ized plant control systems to intelligent decentralization (Shrouf, Ordi-


eres, & Miragliotta, 2014). According to the same author, this


approach allows the machines to adapt to changes and behavior, auto


reconfiguring, showing the ability of systems to perceive information


and obtain results, besides storing knowledge gained from experience.


That is intelligent production at systems and processes level, with


adequate engineering and quick installations in the future


(Kagermann, Wahlster, & Helbig, 2013).


Industry 4.0 offers new and innovative ways for organizations to


manage and monitor their operations intelligently and seamlessly using


the maximum of embedded technology, sensors, and connections. Based


on research found in Weyer, Schmitt, Ohmer, and Gorecky (2015) and


Stock and Selinger (2016), but as highlighted in Qin, Liu, and Grosve-


nor (2016), the technology roadmap for the realization of Industry 4.0 is


still unclear and the gap analysis between current manufacturing systems


and industry requirements 4.0 shows that there is still a long way to go.


TRM is intended to help understand how technology and business


knowledge combine to provide strategic support, innovation, and hence


the operational process in the enterprise in the context of the external


and internal environment (Blismas, Wakefield, & Hauser, 2010; Kim


et al., 2009). Roadmapping is a long-term planning instrument that allows


establishing strategic goals and estimating the potential of new technolo-


gies, products, and services (Vishnevskiy, Karasev, & Meissner, 2016). It


is concerned with identifying technological trends as well as the most


important (key) technologies (Phaal, Farrukh, & Probert, 2001, 2004).


TRM is a growing technique widely used for strategic planning and align-


ment of technology with general business objectives. TRM's are widely


used in several diverse fields in products, technology, industry, enter-


prises, and national levels (P. Bloem, Schlichtkrull, et al., 2018; S. L.


Bloem, Vasconcellos, Guedes, Guedes, & Costa, 2018). An increasing


number of published articles on the subject indicate that there is more


considerable attention to TRM among academics, industry, and govern-


ment researchers (Amer & Daim, 2010). However, there is a growing


need for new models and innovations. With the use of these newJEL classification code: L21.

approaches and tools in conjunction with the TRM, one can increase its


impact on the company, develop new capabilities, and better prepare the


organization for the changes imposed by innovation, technology, and


globalization (Zhang et al., 2016). The research question: How would a


TRM system for software development in industry 4.0 be?


The study seeks to propose a TRM for the development of soft-


ware in the industry 4.0. The methodological approach adopted was


the bibliographic review and the case study. The approach of the


study will be guided by the term “systematic” for the descriptions of


how the general requirements should be addressed, which are


described in the literature as a model, structure (NBR ISO


31000, 2009), systematic or process (Goldberg & Weber, 1998) and


strategy for techniques or tools that support the analysis, being judged


more appropriate for the context researched. The research will also use


the term technology road-mapping or TRM because according to


Willyard and McClees (1987) the term technology was used by the


name of TRM in its broader context in which it means the application


of science to problem-solving of capacity development, market, compe-


tition, and performance. The research adopts the terms TRM to men-


tion the method, road-mapping for its application process and roadmap


to the result in the form of a map. The article is structured as follows:


The first section presents the research, its objectives, and its justifica-


tions; section two is dedicated to the literature review on industry 4.0,


software development and TRM; section three contemplates materials


and methods; section four presents the analysis of results and, finally,


section five presents the conclusions and direction for future research.


2 | LITERATURE REVIEW


2.1 | Industry 4.0


Industry 4.0 is an additional stage of development in the organization


and management of the entire value chain process involved in the


manufacturing industry. It may be called the fourth industrial revolution


(Schlick, Stephan, Loskyll, & Lappe, 2012). Industry 4.0 is widely used in


Europe, particularly in the manufacturing sector of Germany. In general,


other related terms are also used to refer to it, such as Internet of things,


Internet of everything or industrial Internet (Mahidhar & Schatsky, 2013).


These terms will be used in the search for articles. All these terms and


concepts have in common the recognition that the traditional methods


of manufacture and production are in full digital transformation


(Openshaw et al., 2014). Industrial processes have increasingly adopted


modern information technology (IT), but recent trends go beyond the


simple automation of production that, since the early 1970s, was driven


by developments in electronics and IT (Longo et al., 2017).


The widespread adoption by the manufacturing industry and the tra-


ditional operations of information and communication technology are


increasingly intertwined in the boundaries between the real world and


the virtual world in the well-known Cyber Physical Production Systems,


which are the nucleus of new distributed control and automation sys-


tems, or the production system of the near future (Keeley, 2013). CPPSs


are online networks of social machines that are organized in a similar


way to social networks. They connect IT with mechanical and electronic


components that communicate with each other over a network. Radio-


frequency identification technology, which has been used since 1999,


was a very early form of this technology (Shrouf et al., 2014).


Intelligent machines continuously share information about current


inventory levels, problems or failures, and changes in orders or levels of


demand (Mahidhar & Schatsky, 2013). Processes and deadlines are coor-


dinated to increase efficiency and optimizing production times, capacity


utilization, and quality in development, production, marketing, and pro-


curement (Schlick et al., 2012). CPPSs are not only network machines


among themselves, but they also create an intelligent network of


machines, properties, systems, intelligent products, and the complete


product lifecycle (Keeley, 2013). Sensors and control elements allow


machines to be linked to plants, fleets, networks, and humans. Intelligent


networks of this type are the basis of intelligent factories, and they sup-


port industry 4.0 (Cotteleer, Holdowsky, &Mahto, 2013). Qin et al. (2016)


propose a categorical and hierarchical framework, where Industry 4.0 is


achievable through a continuous and incremental process of evolution,


whose main dimensions are automation and intelligence.


Central to industry 4.0 is its interface with other intelligent infra-


structures, such as smart mobility, smart networking, intelligent logis-


tics, and intelligent houses and buildings (Openshaw et al., 2014).


Links to commercial and social networks—the business web and the


social web—also play an increasingly important role in digital transfor-


mation for the industry 4.0 (Mahidhar & Schatsky, 2013). All these


new networks and interfaces offered by the industry 4.0 within an


internet of things, services, data, and people mean that manufacturing


is subject to enormous changes in the future (Cotteleer et al., 2013).


This trend is still in its infancy in some industrial enterprises and


industrial sectors, but in others, the transformation to industry 4.0 is


already underway. The traditional industrial economies hope that this


fourth industrial revolution will bring many advantages, such as


improved global competitiveness (Openshaw et al., 2014).


Moore's law (Déchamps & Niels, 2018; Moore, 1965) states that


the capacity of microchips, bandwidth, and computers doubles every


18 months, representing exponential growth—also applies to other tech-


nological developments. 3D printing, sensor technology, artificial intelli-


gence, robotics, drones, and nanotechnology are just a few examples of


exponentially increasing technologies that are radically changing indus-


trial processes, accelerating them and making them more flexible (Longo


et al., 2017). These technologies are not new. However, the massive


increase in computing power and cost reduction, coupled with miniaturi-


zation, make them suitable for industrial use (Hall, Gu, & Guo, 2018).


2.2 | Software development and industry 4.0


The software industry is directly linked to industry 4.0 because it


derives all the techniques and solutions that the technological organi-


zation needs (Mineo et al., 2016). Industry solutions techniques 4.0


(Keeley, 2013; Mahidhar & Schatsky, 2013; Openshaw et al., 2014):


Vertical network: IT integration, data analysis and management,


cloud-based applications, and operational efficiency 2.0. Horizontal

integration: business model optimization, intelligent supply chain,


intelligent logistics, IT security management, new taxation models,


and the new management of the intellectual property. Engineering


across the value chain: the “ten kinds of innovation,” efficient manage-


ment of innovation, efficient management of the life cycle. Exponen-


tial Technologies: corporate business and organizational learning.


Industry 4.0 is well conceptualized and transparent in its foundations,


it is a complicated process due to the diversity of systems and given


the multiplicity of available/conceivable solutions (Longo et al., 2017).


In this context of intelligent data management, software, which is all


the documentation and configuration data required for the applica-


tion/program to run error-free, is an innovative industry tool. Soft-


ware engineers are involved in the development of software products,


such as database, word processors, project management tools, also


covering complex areas such as air-traffic control systems, systems,


websites, e-commerce (Sommerville, 2011).


Software development should be a set of organized activities used


to define, develop, test, and maintain software (Lamounier, 2014).


These activities result in a product that reflects the way the whole pro-


cess was conducted. Each software has a development cycle, no matter


its size and how many people are working on it, all applications go


through the same steps (Bezerra, 2015). A process must be appropriate


to the application domain and the specific project. Processes must be


defined on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the specifications


of the application, the technology to be adopted in its construction, the


organization in which the product will be deployed, and who will


develop (Coser, Carvalho, & Kovaleski, 2006). According to the litera-


ture of Wazlawick (2013) and Pressman, Maxim, and Bruce (2016) the


software development process can be divided into seven phases:


design, requirements gathering, requirements analysis, design, imple-


mentation, testing, and deployment. For software development, other


related terms such as cloud application, IT security, and data manage-


ment can be found in theory (Keeley, 2013; Openshaw et al., 2014).


These terms will also be used in the search for articles search.


The risks/challenges of software integration and new technologies


identified are (Blanco-Novoa, Fernández-Caramés, Fraga-Lamas, &


Vilar-Montesinos, 2018; Bologa et al., 2017; Giorgio, Romero, Onori, &


Wang, 2017; Martinez et al., 2017; Penas, Plateaux, Patalano, &


Hammadia, 2017; Teles, Vianna Jr., & Le Roux, 2018; Wang, Zhang, Liu,


Li, & Tang, 2017): lack of systems compatibility, labor replacement, the


impact of consumer relations, the structure of big data, security and


robustness of information systems (legislation), expansion of Internet


services and communication, and diffusion of the new technological


scenario for students and researchers. With innovations allied to new


market needs, new tools and models are needed, especially when the


business is connected to technology/software (Shmuelli & Ronen,


2017). One approach that makes this connection is the TRM.


2.3 | Technology roadmapping


A TRM connects technologies with the strategic objectives of a com-


pany and, therefore, supports the acquisition of necessary


technologies before the needs. It is a powerful tool for strategic plan-


ning and technology management. As technology is changing rapidly


and competition in the market is fierce, the role of a TRM is becoming


increasingly important (Choi, Kim, Yoon, Kim, & Lee, 2013). According


to Phaal et al. (2001, 2004), TRM assists the development and imple-


mentation of integrated business strategies, products, and technology


plans, providing companies with the information, processes, and tools


needed to understand these strategies. Roadmaps and the road-


mapping process can broaden the horizons of planning, identify possi-


ble threats and opportunities in the business environment. There is a


wide variety of maps. This fact occurs due to the absence of a stan-


dard process for its elaboration (Phaal et al., 2001, 2004). Kappel


(2001) developed a taxonomy as a proposal to characterize and


understand map variations. In it, there are four significant areas of


application for the map: science-technology, industry, product-tech-


nology, and product. According to Albright and Kappel (2003), the


TRM of products is used by companies to define their evolution plan,


linking the business strategy, evolution of characteristics, and costs of


the product with the technologies necessary to reach the strategic


objectives. TRMs, for product planning, is the most common type and


are related to the insertion of technology into manufactured products


(Phaal et al., 2001).


The TRM tends to have its areas of the application linked to compa-


nies with technological capacity and a member of large networks of


chains, such as the automobile industry (Andrade, Monti, & Silva, 2009),


energy industry (Amer & Daim, 2010; Hillegas-Elting, Yu, Oliver, Daim, &


Estep, 2016), wind energy (Amer, Daim, & Jetter, 2016), pharmacy


(Tierney, Hermina, & Walsh, 2013), among others. Studies (Garcia &


Bray, 2007) suggest that the roadmap can be represented on two levels:


industrial or corporate. Some organizations use TRM internally as an


aspect of their technology planning (corporate TRM) (Vishnevskiy,


Karasev, & Meissner, 2015). However, at the industrial level, the TRM


involves multiple organizations, either individually or in a consortium


(industrial TRM) (Loureiro, 2010). Little is found in the literature on the


use of the tool in smaller companies, even having an inventive and tech-


nological character, such as software companies. Trends are already


being observed in these sectors, as can be seen in innovation support


research by Ho and O'Sullivan (2017) and in developing countries by


Ghazinoory, Dastranj, Saghafi, Kulshreshtha, and Hasanzadeh (2017).


Phaal et al. (2001) present the main model of TRM, T-plan, the approach


is developed to support managers who are committed to developing


and communicating their product and business technology planning.


The conventional T-plan encompasses four seminars. The first three


focus on the three key layers of the map (market/business, product/ser-


vice, and technology). The fourth seminar joins these three tiers on a


time basis to construct the chart/data table: (a) Seminar 1: identification


of the market and business drivers and the performance dimensions of


the product; (b) Seminar 2: the creation of product characteristics con-


ceptions; (c) Seminar 3: identification of options for technological solu-


tions; (d) Seminar 4: mapping of milestones, product, and evolution of


technology, among other approaches and adaptations.


TRM is a useful tool because it links innovation and technology to


organizational strategy (Ghazinoory et al., 2017). The combination of


DE OLIVEIRA VALÉRIO ET AL. 519






other management techniques with TRM can reduce knowledge gaps


and further improve management decisions (Zhang et al., 2016). As


pointed out by Carvalho et al. (2013), there are only limited research


papers on hybrid procedures. The tools that can be integrated with


the TRM include SWOT analysis, Delphi method, five competition


forces, value proposition, competitive characteristics matrix, percep-


tual map, hierarchical process analysis (AHP), technology development


envelope (Fenwick, Daim, & Gerdsri, 2009), (QFD) (Lee, Phaal, & Lee,


2013), portfolio management (Phaal, Farrukh, & Probert, 2006) and


technology management tools (Probert & Radnor, 2003). Regardless


of how it is used, TRM has been adapting to new global trends and


becoming more complex (Vishnevskiy et al., 2015).


3 | MATERIALS AND METHODS


In order to propose a systematic mapping technology for the develop-


ment of software in industry 4.0, descriptive research was carried out


systematically (Gressler, 2004). Regarding the nature of the research,


the qualitative approach was used. In the present study, a biblio-


graphic review was performed to find the general requirements that


will compose the systematic and then a case study, employing a nov-


elist, for validation of the same. The bibliometric research data was


acquired from articles between 2013 and 2020. The articles were col-


lected through databases: ISI Web of Science, Science Direct, and


SCOPUS. It is justified the choices to be considered the best mecha-


nisms of academic search to facilitate the searches by scientific con-


tent, considering the criteria of specificity by area, scientific language,


credibility, reliability, and responsibility (Buchinger, Cavalcanti, &


Hounsell, 2014). The data collection period was March of 2018. The


keywords of the survey are industry 4.0 and software development.


In order to maintain the comprehensiveness and legitimacy of the


research, other related terms or derivations, already explained in the


literature review, concerning keywords were also used. They were, for


industry 4.0, the Internet of things, the Internet of everything and


industrial Internet, and for software development, cloud application,


IT security, and data management.


The collected data was examined through the technique of con-


tent analysis, where systematic procedures and objectives are used to


describe the messages, aiming at the inference of knowledge regard-


ing the conditions of production. Three steps were performed: pre-


analysis, the analytical description, and the interpretation of the data


(Bardin, 2011). Finally, a case study was carried out to adapt the pro-


posed systemic approach. Industry experts 4.0 in the academic and/or


practical areas were interviewed, from the considerations about the


systematic, one can determine and adapt its stages. The case study


was chosen because it is a qualitative method that consists of a way


to deepen an individual unit. It serves to answer questions that the


researcher does not have much control over the phenomenon studied.


It is a tool used to understand the form and motives that led to a deci-


sion. According to Yin (2015), the case study is a research strategy


that comprises a method that covers everything in specific


approaches of data collection and analysis. This study may help in the


search for new theories and questions that will serve as the basis for


future investigations. It has as one of the most important sources of


information, interviews. Through them, the interviewee will express


their opinion on a specific subject, using their interpretations


(Yin, 2015).


4 | ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS


The TRM directs future actions and relates to the company as a whole.


Innovations and technologies need to be managed to gain strategic


learning and development (Ghazinoory et al., 2017). With the use of


new approaches and tools in conjunction with the TRM, one can


expand its impact to the company, develop new capabilities, and better


prepare the organization for the changes imposed by innovation, tech-


nology, and globalization. The construction of systematics will be done


by combining the general requirements of software development


within industry 4.0, which are necessary for the full development and


creation of the value of the organization that will use this new system.


The basis of this new system comes from the alignment that both TRM


and industry 4.0 have with strategic planning, future development


approaches, and intelligence networks. With the bibliometric and biblio-


graphic studies on the subject, one can make this relation of the TRM


with methodologies linked to high technology, cutting-edge innovation,


and connection tools. A bibliographic review was carried out between


the years 2013 and 2018, with 43 articles identified, referring to indus-


try 4.0 and software development. From the analysis, the general indus-


try requirements 4.0 adapted to the context of software development


are (Keeley, 2013; Mahidhar & Schatsky, 2013; Openshaw et al., 2014)


found in Tables 1–5.


Regarding the general requirements, it is essential to comment on


current risk thinking, which includes the possibility of opportunity risk,


which could have a beneficial effect in achieving the long-term organi-


zational goals, that is, in future planning. The risks as opportunities are


linked to technological opportunities, innovation, and strategy since


management involves the identification and management of all


sources of uncertainty that originate and shape perceptions of threats


and opportunities within organizations. These influence decision mak-


ing and the company's future.


The embedded software in the context of the modularity related


to the development of systems is discussed. Parnas (1972) mentions


that it brings modularity by dividing a system into independent parts


known as modules, which can be modified individually without addi-


tional information from others. The modules are indeed independent,


the modification or addition of new modules does not interfere in the


system (or language) as a whole, contributing to agility and practicality


in the development or maintenance processes (Oliveira, 2017).


P. Bloem, Schlichtkrull, et al. (2018) and S. L. Bloem, Vasconcellos,


et al. (2018) stress the importance of learning and management of inno-


vation and the new and integrated methodologies, such as big data,


augmented and virtual reality, and clouds, which are considered as the


pillars of the new industrial revolution. The tools that make technology


management are essential because they can anticipate technological


520 DE OLIVEIRA VALÉRIO ET AL.






trends, contributing to decision making, resource allocation, risk analy-


sis, and the definition of technologies and skills to be developed.


Software development allied to industry 4.0 come across the


problems of integration, or even losses from software development in


an unstable and transforming environment. The modern industrializa-


tion goes through some significant challenges that are explained in


the systematics. Industry 4.0 will substantially increase the technologi-


cal complexity of value-adding processes (F. Lopez et al., 2017). Mas-


tering this degree of complexity requires adequate software tools to


design and build the proper installations and systems, and of course,


also to operate them (Prause & Weigand, 2016). It can be seen that


industry 4.0 in several areas, such as software development, has been


gaining prominence in the organizational environment and is growing


in studies and research. As one of the top priorities of industrial devel-


opment, industry 4.0 is described as the pursuit of academic and busi-


ness practice (Mueller et al., 2017). However, much still can be


explained in the fields of technology, allied to strategy. One of the


tools that can help acquisition of knowledge and innovation is


the TRM. Aligned with the T plan model, there are the steps of the


systematics:

4.1 | Stage 1: Preparation


In Stage 1, the opportunity analysis is carried out as to the require-

operational efficiency and optimization of the business model. Opera-


tional efficiency analysis and optimization of business models must be


made in the planning phase, as they determine the direction of the


other phases.


The risks/challenges are discussed, including understanding the


functioning of the sensors and the lack of compatibility between the sys-


tems (Penas et al., 2017), labor replacement, and the highly automated


factories (Teles et al., 2018). The risks of lack of compatibility between

systems and the challenge of replacing labor should be discussed at this


planning stage because they are significant and complex challenges with


risks to bring complications to the organizational strategy.


4.2 | Stage 2: Workshops


The workshops are held in an integrated and complementary way.


It stands out because this stage is the moment to connect the


actions and to delimit the most significant challenges. It is the


moment for the discussion and consolidation of the ideas of inte-


gration and the effective management of the innovation and tech-


nologies reached or aimed. During these steps of the workshops


phase, the general requirements that can be discussed and analyzed


are disclosed. The study provides a basis for discussion, with the


following requirements being considered for analysis of the current


situation and the future planning of information technology. In par-


ticular, the issue of IT integration and IT security management, new


interfaces, and data are discussed. New intellectual property man-


agement, data analysis, management, and cloud-based applications;


integrated and intelligent management are analyzed with particular


attention to smart logistics, smart supply chain, and life cycle


management.


The general requirements related to information technology dem-


onstrate how the organization is involved with technology and how it


intends to modernize and manage these future transformations that


should occur at all levels of the company, be it on the cloud-based


Internet, or the security involved in the IT operations and the different


and necessary ways to innovate in several areas creating the difference.


The risks/challenges to be discussed are those regarding security and


robustness of information systems, such as transmission failures in


machine-to-machine communication, protecting the organization's


know-how (Sha et al., 2018), more reliable transactions (Bologa et al.,


2017), information security, intellectual and cultural property rights


concerning the data generated (Wang et al., 2017), the need for expan-


sion of mobile and fixed Internet services with adequate bandwidth for


new data traffic (Martinez et al., 2017). Discharge of telecommunica-


tions services—aimed at increasing electronic commerce as a necessary


platform for the new competitive environment (Martinez et al., 2017).


The general requirements for data analysis and management


should be analyzed in this step, where the team needs to organize and


be concerned about the quantity and quality of the data found. Proper


administration of the extensive database collected for the understand-


ing of the other stages should occur, such as 6Cs of the “big data” or


large and complex data structure (Wang et al., 2017). An extensive


database needs complete data management, so there are risks related


to data loss, loss of part of the information, or even lack of under-


standing of data. Knowledge about connection, cyber, content, com-


munity, cloud, and customization are required.


All the general requirements related to integrated and intelligent


management are discussed at this stage because they are directed to


the factors of production. In order to have a competitive technological


product or service, one must be concerned with its life cycle, logistics,


and all the layers of the supply chain, as well as how to manage the


new intellectual property conditions. This concern is justified because


it is a stable and innovative environment, which needs specific capaci-


ties and care to face the constant change in the technological sce-


nario. The possible risks/challenges should be discussed at this stage


concerning the impact of extremely exclusive consumer and product


relationships (Determine how customer dissatisfaction and possible


discards should be regulated) (Giorgio et al., 2017). The challenge of


managing customer dissatisfaction and managing exclusive products is


related to the capacity and organization of production management


and strategic management, so the importance of understanding con-


sumer relations and avoiding the risks of dissatisfaction.


4.3 | Stage 3: Execution


In the final stage of the systematics, corporate business requirements


and organizational learning is discussed and analyzed. Organizational

study.


Advantages


and


tendencies


The advantages come from the technological


development that business and knowledge brings


to the organization. They address active learning


and new forms of study that integrate and


contribute to the development of the industry.


This movement of science allied with practice


tends to break down barriers within and outside


technological organizations.

learning and the idea of an expanded corporate business, such as, for


example, the incentive for startups, puts the company in a proactive


position about the challenges of the industry. Showing that the organi-


zation is willing to develop in an innovative environment and with learn-


ing in all processes and changes. Systematics should always be under


review, even after the end of the process, so that all the information


gathered is devoted to strategic business. Finally, the challenge of being


open to the academic community and researchers should be further dis-


cussed, and these can bring significant advances in processes, structures,


models, and approaches, whether in management, technology, innova-


tion, or the value chain. The risks/challenges should be discussed at this


stage as to the need to disseminate the new technological scenario for


students, who will be responsible for the implementation and mainte-


nance of technologies applied in new factories and service companies.


Bring the community of technology researchers to the discussion forum


(Teles et al., 2018). The systematics can be identified in Figure 1.


The aim is to demonstrate how a systematic approach to business


needs can be developed, adding the general innovative and techno-


logical requirements that were worked during the research. The sys-


tematics does not seek to be prescriptive but, as a generalist proposal,


are open for change and adaptation and based on discussions during


the process. The analysis should be focused on the alignment


between what was identified and the company's strategy (Pillkahn,


2008). It is vital that the team members keep the expected results in


mind at the end of each stage, not just to keep the focus on the rele-


vant points, but to ensure that, at the end of the whole process, the


team has the blocks and levels for integration. It is desirable to check


the system periodically in order to monitor the changes and assess


the achievement and progress toward the goals.


4.4 | Analysis of specialists


The proposed theoretical systematics was constructed based on


the literature review on the themes. The systematics has been sub-


jected to expert analysis to verify its practical suitability for busi-


ness environments. The practical adaptation of the systematics was


carried out with three specialists who develop activities related to


the concepts of industry 4.0, both in the academic and/or business


spheres. The experts' analysis used a questionnaire as a means of


collecting data, and it was validated through a pilot test. In the pilot


test, the specialist was asked to analyze the questionnaire consider-


ing their questions (Table 6). The specialists indicated small changes


in the format and recommended it as a means of collecting the data


in electronic forms, to facilitate the fulfillment by the respondents.


The questions were the following: “What is your critical opinion


about systematics? Would you add or remove a requirement?


Which element is the most important and/or most relevant?


Because?” The specialists were selected according to their aca-


demic background and experience in industry 4.0, and the engi-


neering area. The leading specialists were selected on the platform

neering), and subject (industry 4.0). Table 7 shows the data.


Four waves of research submissions were performed. Table 8


shows the time, the number of specialists, and responses.


The fourth wave was sent to try to reduce the error variation, but


there was no response, therefore, interrupting the sending. For the tri-


als, carried out in the period from March to April 2019, have the


description of the specialists (Table 9).


The specialist 2 considered all the essential requirements without


removing any of them. However, the same specialist emphasized the


important parts of each step and added comments on it. In the dimen-


sion of the opportunity analysis, he advised to consider the infrastruc-


ture risk, since it is often the case of innovative technology, but the


infrastructure requires high investment to make the initiative via-


ble. An example is a mobility that uses tablets for operational effi-


ciency and requires Wi-Fi in the manufacturing environment.


Usually, Wi-Fi capability, when available, does not meet the need.

technology policies that block and/or delay project progress too


much. It was also appointed to stage the operations technology


(OT) issues, aiming the gap between information technology activi-


ties to higher levels of the automation pyramid without experience


at lower levels. This procedure causes a huge gap and relevant


stops of productive processes. A simple upgrade of a patch


(a program that updates or fixes software) from the operating sys-


tem can stop the production of a factory. One of the points consid-


ered relevant is the IT regulation issue.


The dimension of integratedmanagement was indicated to talk about


the point of integration between information technology and business,


eliminating the previous structure that focuses only on corporate financial


systems and operates in a stratified way between routine services and


innovation projects. A recent structure envisions an area focused on busi-


ness (enhancing the role of the analyst and/or business manager) and a


product line area, which has experts for various solutions that support the


business. Cybersecurity was placed as another relevant point. It should


not be confused or embedded in the approach to regulation, but rather in


internal policies and procedures that modernize information technology


and focus on IT and OT integration. Cloud storage should be placed on


the constraints of cybersecurity. Most productive machine vendors have


already included in their portfolio predictive maintenance with applica-


tions running in the cloud. The point is data collection in the manufactur-


ing environment and sending it to the external cloud (local or somewhere


in the world). This result can be done directly using the firewall and VPN,


yet out of many information technology policies, constituting yet another


roadblock to advance the industry 4.0 projects.


Regarding the specialist 3, the proposal and requirements are


adequate and coherent. He proposed that in the IT tables, new data


interface and management could be better detailed, referring to how


and what will be done at all three levels. It was suggested the descrip-


tion of more technologies in the workshop stage and improvements in


the texts to indicate how, where, and by whom the information man-


agement will be carried out, for example. Besides, all five require-


ments are essential because of the waterfall interdependence


between them. However, if an execution had to be chosen as the


most important, it would be the last one.


Regarding the specialist 4, all requirements are important, highlight-


ing the steps of information technology and analysis of opportunities.


On the step of new interfaces and data, emphasis must be given in


terms of big data and cloud storage. The specialist did not indicate to


withdraw any requirement. However, each step should be explained in


all its concepts. After incorporating the suggestions of specialists, the


systematics was consolidated in the tables with the suggested changes.


The systematic practice maintained the requirement structure.


5 | CONCLUSION


The study sought a TRM for software development in the industry


4.0. Through the bibliographic review, the general requirements for


industry 4.0 in the context of software development were found to


be the following. IT integration, data analysis and management, cloud-


based applications and operational efficiency 2.0, optimization of the


business model, intelligent supply chain and logistics, IT security man-


agement, new intellectual property management, life cycle manage-


ment, corporate business, and organizational learning. In addition, to


the principal risks/challenges of software integration and new tech-


nologies such as lack of systems compatibility, labor replacement, the


impact of consumer relations, “big data” structure, security, and


robustness of information systems (legislation). From the general


requirements, it was possible to find the differential that would guide


the systematic proposal. Based on the concepts of management and


engineering, it is possible to propose the system, which modifies the


TRM, through current and future state protocols of the company dur-


ing three stages, where the general industry requirements 4.0 and the


potential risks/challenges are discussed.


The research brought light to the study of the different and more


updated aspects of software development in the context of industry 4.0


in integration with other essential approaches related to the new way of


managing innovations and strategies. The study develops technical and


academic knowledge in these areas, which are relevant for technological


and organizational development. The study seeks to delve deeper into


industry 4.0, which needs to be appropriately interpreted and applied in


software development organizations. The results of the research sought


to demonstrate the relevance of management and its opportunities to


deal with issues and challenges that the new software industry brings


about. Innovation management is reflected in the company's decision-


making, which will opt for more significant and better means and tools


to adapt its strategic vision in the long term. The study contributes to


knowledge about the new ways of managing the technologies, adapting


to technological changes, creating organizational value.


The study summarizes the research challenges that must be faced


by researchers in the field. It also shows the practical implications that


the theme has in common with universities, business, research, and


development, the growth of industrialization, interconnection, among


others. Showing industry 4.0 as necessary and challenging for soft-


ware advancements, so the importance of studying and understanding


the specificities of issues related to best practices and strategic deci-


sion making. This article contributes to knowledge about industry 4.0.


The work could update previous studies and advance knowledge,


bringing knowledge about new and different approaches.
