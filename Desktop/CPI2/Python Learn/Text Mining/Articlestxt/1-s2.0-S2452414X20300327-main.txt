COVID-19 is accelerating industrial information integration (III) for sustainable epidemic prevention and in-
novation design. It is important to emphasize that this interaction makes it reciprocal. To prevent COVID-19, the
III of industrial sectors should be strengthened to encourage innovation for sustainable epidemic prevention.
Accordingly, we studied the overall dynamic change trend of industrial sectors’ information integration net-
works (IIN), the characteristics of individual IIN, and their influence on IIN performance. In the study, the
gravity model and social network analysis were used to determine the variables of industrial sectors’ information
distance and quality, and to construct the IIN of industrial sectors. The results show that the overall relevance of
the IIN of industrial sectors is low, and the network density fluctuates, with high network efficiency and poor
stability. Two-way, strong correlation between industrial sectors is relatively low. The spillover effect of in-
dustrial sectors in the upstream of the industrial chain is poor, and it is difficult to have a strong information
integration driving effect on the downstream industrial sectors. The interplate linkage of the IIN of industrial
sectors is insufficient. Compared with point centrality and closeness, improvement of the betweenness centrality
of industrial sectors can significantly improve IIN performance.


1. Introduction


The unexpected novel coronavirus of late 2019 has shattered many
people's plans. China has actively respond to control COVID-19. At
present, the disease has been effectively controlled in China. However,
as of June 1, 2020, the global spread of coronavirus is still very serious,
and the whole human race faces a serious test. There is no doubt that
COVID-19 causes damage to material production and a threat to human
life and health [1]. COVID-19 is an emergent public health event, and
its infectivity and danger will have a great impact on the development
of industrial information networks in the long term. On the one hand,
COVID-19 is accelerating industrial sectors’ information integration for
sustainable innovation design and epidemic prevention [2]. On the
other hand, industrial sectors’ information integration provides an ef-
ficient operational platform for COVID-19 prevention and control [3].
In terms of information networks in epidemic prevention, an informa-
tion network based on scientific development and technology innova-
tion could be a useful weapon in the fight against diseases [4]. China
has made full use of its achievements in terms of scientific and


technology innovation in recent years to coordinate the country's re-
search efforts [5]. At the same time, China has provided strong scien-
tific and technological support for the prevention and control of the
epidemic through clinical information network cooperation. For ex-
ample, government departments accelerated the development and ap-
plication of a science and technology network, and launched 83
emergency response projects. In terms of industrial sectors’ information
integration engineering, new technologies such as big data and artificial
intelligence were made full use of to study and judge epidemic trends
and conduct epidemiological investigations [6]. Databases built during
outbreaks are used to predict the risk of outbreaks in different regions.
5 G video real-time communication platforms and Internet of Things
technologies are used to solve the problem of real-time interaction
between epidemiological investigation teams and high-level experts
thousands of kilometers away. Information integration tools such as
health codes, a communication big data travel card, and epidemic maps
have been easy ways for the public to prevent infection [7].


There is no doubt that industrial information integration (III) has
played an important role in the response to COVID-19. III is the

foundation of the new era of information and communication tech-
nology [8]. In 2005, Xu first put forward the concept of III engineering
[9], and information integration has been widely used in various fields
of industrial sectors. III is a new concept proposed by the integrated
application of emerging information technologies such as 5 G, Internet
of Things, big data, cloud computing, wireless communication network,
and artificial intelligence in the field of modern industry [10]. The new
concept is a very important subject in the industrialization and in-
formatization process, which focuses on the digital and information
transformation of industrial sectors [11]. Supply chain management
can be used to demonstrate the advantages of III during an emergency
response [12]. Supply chains based on III have played a huge role in
delivering epidemic prevention supplies in response to COVID-19. The
representative industrial Internet of Things is the typical product of III.
The Industrial Internet of Things can help enterprises to aggregate and
analyze data from sensors to maximize machine efficiency for in-
tegrated manufacturing systems and intelligently connected healthcare
systems [12]. The medical Internet of things, based on Industry 4.0, has
played a key role in healthcare systems [13]. For example, the medical
Internet of Things technology has been gradually applied to health
identification, diagnosis and treatment, hospital informatization, health
management, and other population and health fields. The application is
based on communication, electronics, biology, medicine, and other
information technologies.


In addition, the epidemic or medical areas application based on III
has gradually attracted the attention of some scholars. For example,
Agarwal and Searls developed a lightweight method for the drug in-
dustry [14]. Subsequently, Wong et al. used multiresolution analysis to
study combining process and spectral data [15]. Schaewe et al. studied
the application of an image dynamic process to brain monitoring [16].
Xu et al. developed a data access approach in an Internet of Things-
based information system for medical services [17]. Horner and Cullen
established a database for industrial sector workers with Medicare data
[18]. Chen reviewed the literature on III from 37 research cate-
gories, and determined that information and communication tech-
nology is an important factor that causes III to be useful to the medical
service field [19]. Da Silva et al. developed a program to integrate
technology with medical devices [20]. Ibrahim and Singhal proposed a
platform system for reliably retrieving medical information from re-
mote suppliers on demand [21]. Farhad et al. and Deckmyn et al. de-
veloped a matched antenna and substrate-integrated compact antenna
array, respectively, for industrial, scientific, and medical use [22,23].
Goursaud and Gorce concluded that III is a key technology to support
digital cities, healthcare, and the monitoring of the elderly [24]. Xu
et al. proposed a circularly polarized antenna for biomedical applica-
tions [25]. Namee et al. developed an emergency platform to monitor
defibrillator cabinets in medical services [26]. Saadi et al. proposed


integrating data mining technology into medical decision support [27].
Wei et al. conducted a survey on geographic visual display techniques
in epidemiology [28]. Chen continued to conduct a survey on III in
2016‒2019, and noted that research on the pharmaceutical industrial
sector mainly concentrated on the practical application of III [29].
Based on the above analysis, III is gradually being used to meet people's
medical service needs, such as genomic data, surface electro-
myography, and so on [30,31]. However, research on the project
management of the pharmaceutical industry based on III is rare. The
development of the pharmaceutical industry chain is not only based on
R&D, production, and marketing, but also is closely related to other
industrial sectors [13]. For example, big data analysis and cognitive
systems are used to obtain data from wearable devices, which will
improve the R&D efficiency of the pharmaceutical sector. Pharmaceu-
tical enterprises can take advantage of the advancement of the Internet
of Things to access real-time information during drug sales to improve
the visibility of monitoring.


COVID-19 is accelerating III for sustainable epidemic prevention
and innovation design. At the same time, COVID-19 epidemic preven-
tion and control has exposed deficiencies in the industrial sectors’ in-
formation integration networks (IIN) and public health emergency
management systems. Major public security incidents involving human
safety require large capacity and high-channel information and com-
munication technologies to provide safe and efficient medical services
[32]. It has been difficult to establish a cooperative sharing mechanism
in data sharing, so it is difficult to share and integrate clinical, basic,
and public health data. Project management in the pharmaceutical in-
dustry is based on III, which is an important way to prevent and control
infectious diseases. Together with other industrial sectors, it forms a set
of technologies and concepts based on medical services [33]. The global
spread of COVID-19 has led to high requirements for III in various
countries. Intelligent medical care based on the deep integration of
robotics, big data, and the medical industry involves not only the basic
medical industry, but also network suppliers, system integrators, radio
equipment suppliers, telecom operators, advanced instrument manu-
facturing, and other related industrial sectors [34]. Based on the above
analysis, the framework of III, applied to the prevention and control of
infectious diseases such as COVID-19, is shown in Fig. 1.


The development of III is characterized by scientific and technolo-
gical innovation and cross-integration. The advancement of industrial
technology and medical technology, and the R&D and application of
intelligent medical treatment and artificial intelligence, are closely re-
lated to the technological innovation and cross-integration of III [35].
The innovation development driven by ecological sharing is the key
driving force for the leap-forward development and cross-border in-
tegration of III. Collaborative innovation based on III can not only
provide a strong guarantee for epidemic prevention, but also can

provide preventive measures against other emergencies [36]. Innova-
tion based on III is a development mode and industrial organization
form to prevent and control pandemics [37]. The innovation can not
only produce a chain reaction in related industrial sections, but also can
provide an effective information supply for other sectors and produce a
spiral III effect [38]. At the same time, intersector information in-
tegration provides the foundation for the innovation, and intersector
IIN provides the innovation path [39]. As far as research on industrial
sectors’ information networks is concerned, many scholars have ana-
lyzed it from many aspects. Jin et al. pointed out that technology-in-
tensive manufacturing and materials have become active sectors for
innovation information interaction [40]. Feng believes that network
density can enhance technological, economic, and social self-reinfor-
cing mechanisms [41]. Fang et al. [42] constructed an industrial sectors
information network to analyze its structural characteristics. Hang [43]
revealed the network structure characteristics of technology informa-
tion spillovers. Li et al. [44] used network topology analysis to em-
pirically test the mechanism of sector networks. However, these studies
have the following shortcomings. With the incidence matrix con-
structed by a vector autoregressive model, it is difficult to present the
development and preciseness of the industrial sectors’ IIN [45]. More-
over, it is impossible to accurately build the industrial sectors’ IIN
through the keyword search method.


Therefore, we believe that, to make up for the lack of existing re-
search, it is important to study the characteristics of industrial sectors’
IIN and analyze the influence of characteristic factors on IIN perfor-
mance, rather than to study the influence mechanism unilaterally. To
make up for the deficiency, this study not only constructs a correlation
matrix based on the sector information distance variable and the
gravity model, but also studies the industrial sectors’ IIN characteristics.
In addition, the panel regression model is used to analyze the influence
of IIN characteristics on IIN performance. Hence, the research on in-
dustrial sectors’ IIN has important significance to improve the efficiency
and quality of III innovation for COVID-19 prevention and control.


The purpose of this study is to manage the level and mechanism of
IIN of the industrial sectors based on innovation linkage to promote III
and respond to COVID-19. The contributions of this study are as fol-
lows. It reveals the level and mechanism of China's III. In addition, it
provides theoretical and practical support for improving the govern-
ance level of public health practices from the perspective of industrial
linkage.


The study includes the following sections. The study methods and
data are presented in Section 2. Section 3 implements the empirical
study from four aspects. Section 4 discusses the results of the study. In
Section 5, the conclusions and limitations of the study are presented.


2. Study design


2.1. Determination of IIN association


The gravity model is a spatial interaction capability model used to
analyze and predict the spatial interaction capability. Many problems,
such as the spatial flow of innovation elements [46,47,48], industrial
agglomeration [49], and knowledge diffusion [50], have been studied
extensively by modifying the coefficients and parameters of the gravity
model. For intersector innovation information flow, different strategies
exist in the same supply chain, with the product as the link. The het-
erogeneity of knowledge lends the IIN great attraction [51,52]. The
existence of sector information distance enhances the information
barrier and impedes the information flow among the network subjects
[53]. The gravity model not only considers the information relationship
through an input‒output table, but also enriches the information
quality of industrial sectors. The model accurately constructs the in-
dustrial sectors’ IIN and describes the dynamic evolution process of the
network. Referring to the setting and analogy of quality and distance
used by Liu [45] and Yu et al. [54], the study takes innovation


information output as the quality variable affecting the information
integration attraction. The III correlation matrix can be established as
follows:

where Yij is the attraction relationship; E and P are the innovation in-
formation output and input; K is the contribution rate; and Dij describes
the sector information distance [55,56].


The input‒output table is used to calculate the sector information
distance. The input‒output table can be expressed as follows:

sition [57], and can be expressed as follows:

2.2. IIN characteristics


(1) At the overall level, we pay attention to the network char-
acteristics of the III network. In this study, network density, network
grade, and network efficiency are the key factors. The higher the den-
sity, the more connected the IINs are. Network hierarchy refers to the
extent to which industrial sectors can be reached asymmetrically. The
position of each sector in the network varies greatly, and more in-
dustrial sectors are in subordinate and marginal positions. The lower
the network efficiency, the more paths there are to reach each other. In
the overall network, the higher the resistance to industrial sectors’
changes, the smoother the flow of information integration between
industrial sectors. The network density can be expressed as follows:

at the individual level. The study mainly investigates the individual
level of industrial sectors’ IIN in terms of point centrality, betweenness
centrality, and closeness. The centrality of a point is closely related to
the center of the network. Absolute centrality calculates the absolute
value of the number of connections to a node. Relative centrality is the
ratio of absolute centrality to the maximum possible degree. Mediation
centrality is the position of a network mediation bridge. The more other
nodes can be reached through this node, the stronger the control ability
of this node. Closeness is concerned with the shortest distance between
the point pairs. The closer to the center they are, the shorter the dis-
tance is between nodes and other nodes. This is more efficient in the
process of information transmission [58]. The added mediation center
can be expressed as follows:

(3) The individual network characteristics in the industrial sectors’
IIN are expressed in different plates, and the connection between plates
and the role of different plates in the network are analyzed. The study
divides plates into four categories according to the number of sending
and receiving relations of each plate [59]. The first type is the main
beneficiary plate, which mainly shows that the number of relations to
receive other plates is greater than the number of relations to send to
other plates. The second type is the main spillover plate, which is
characterized by more relations sent to the outside than the other
plates, and is more active inside. The third type is a bidirectional
spillover plate, which is mainly manifested by sending out relations to
the plate, and is more balanced compared with the inside of the plate.
The fourth type is the broker plate, which has the same number of re-
ceiving relations as sending relations. The division of the four types of
plates is relative.


Based on the above three dimensions, the structure of the study is as
in Fig. 2.


2.3. Data source


The data in the study are from industrial sectors. To make the


calculated sector information distance consistent with the national
economy industry classification 2017, we selected five industrial sec-
tors from mining, 30 industrial sectors from manufacturing, and three
industrial sectors from the power, heat, gas, and water production and
supply industrial sectors, totaling 38 industrial sectors. The network
quality data were taken from the yearbooks produced from 2013 to
2018. The sector information distance data were calculated according
to the basic flow table of the 2017 national input‒output table in 2019.


3. Empirical study


3.1. Overall network characteristics


The study constructed the industrial sectors’ IIN. The mapped in-
dustrial sectors’ information integration directed network re shown in
Fig. 3. To more clearly and intuitively represent the information in-
tegration between various industrial sectors, the node size represents
the point centrality. Fig. 4 depicts the dynamic change of the overall
network correlation density of the sample during the investigation
period. Fig. 5 describes the variation trend of overall network efficiency
and network hierarchy.


3.2. Individual network characteristics


The index is used to explore the information integration among
various industrial sectors from a micro perspective, and can effectively
demonstrate the impact of various industrial sectors on the overall

industrial sectors’ IIN. Based on the three dimensions, we made an in-
depth study of the position and role of various industrial sectors. The
measurement results of 2018 are shown in Table 1.


3.3. Block model


To systematically analyze the characteristics of 38 industrial sectors’
IIN in China, the iterative integration method was used for cluster
analysis, and it was divided into four plates. The information overflow
between plates is shown in Table 2 and Fig. 6.


3.4. The effect of the network characteristics on network performance


The study focused on how these characteristics can affect the IIN
performance of industrial sectors. The performance of individual net-
work characteristics determines the performance of overall network
characteristics. We focused more directly on the effect of individual
characteristics on IIN performance. The inherent information barriers in
some industrial sectors may block information integration in other in-
dustrial sectors. Blind pursuit of information integration is likely to lead
to the waste of resources and the rise of the marginal cost of innovation.
Hence, it is more meaningful to reveal the effect mechanism of the
individual characteristics on the current IIN performance, as shown in
Table 3.


4. Results and discussion


4.1. Analysis of the overall network characteristics


As can be seen from Fig. 3, there are no isolated points in the 38


industrial sectors as a whole, which indicates obvious IIN character-
istics. However, the information correlation between different in-
dustrial sectors is relatively heterogeneous. The correlation number gap
between industrial sectors is obvious. In Fig. 4, the overall industrial
sectors’ IIN is a weak correlation and shows a fluctuating trend. The
industrial sectors’ IIN involves 38 industrial sectors and the maximum
number of possible associations is 1406. However, the maximum
number of associations in 2012 and 2015 was only 261. From the
overall trend, the density of the industrial sectors’ IIN shows a trend of
first increasing and then decreasing. In 2018, it reached its lowest level,
at only 0.1807, with the IIN network showing a loose correlation. As
can be seen from Fig. 5, the network hierarchy showed a downward
trend and remained stable for the past three years. This shows that the
rigid hierarchy of industrial sectors has gradually broken down. Each
industrial sector attaches more and more importance to integrated in-
formation, and the information linkage effect between industrial sectors
is becoming stronger and stronger. More subordinate and marginal
industrial sectors are gradually integrated into the information net-
work. Except for 2015, network efficiency has generally presented an
upward trend, with a maximum of 0.5263 in 2018. The redundant lines
of information correlation between industrial sectors in China are
gradually reduced and the stability of the structure is reduced some-
what. The ability of the IIN to resist risks has decreased; it is vulnerable
to the collapse of the network caused by the instability of intersector
information correlations.


It is found from the dynamic changing trend of the whole network
that the overall relevance of the industrial sectors’ IIN is not high. To
adapt to the new normal of economic development, China made pro-
found adjustments to its industrial policy in 2015 and 2016, which were
transition years for the 12th and 13th five-year plans. For the key areas
of development, the industrial sectors’ development focused on the
information and communications technology sector, the high-end
equipment manufacturing sector, and the green sector. Cutting over-
capacity was the first of five structural reform tasks for 2016.
Government departments were determined to close down backward
production capacity and actively adjust the industrial sectors’ structure,
which is in the process of optimization and upgrading. Most industrial
sectors that manufacture primary products are gradually changing to
manufacture intermediate products and final products. A series of
measures led to a turning point in industrial sectors’ IIN in 2015 and
2016.


During COVID-19, the domestic economy grew rapidly. Online en-
tertainment, remote work, online education, online medical, fresh e-
commerce, and other models have ushered in instant and explosive
growth. Like a catalyst, the epidemic has accelerated the transmission
speed of communication information, forcing people's living and
working habits to move faster. In the future, digital technology will
permeate all walks of life, giving birth to the digital economy, a new
economic form. The commercial use of 5 G, in particular, will accelerate
the digital development of traditional industrial sectors such as energy,
medical care, and education. The COVID-19 outbreak could lead to a
more diversified and resilient global industrial or supply chain.
Although a complete industrial system and complete infrastructure
have laid the foundation for the development of China's global in-
dustrial chain, it is still difficult to restore the chain in the whole in-
dustrial sector. One of the most important reasons is that the efficiency
and quality of sharing information in response to pandemics such as
COVID-19 is not sufficient for the industrial sectors’ response. The role
of leading enterprises should be brought into full play to promote in-
dustrial chain collaboration based on information and communications
technology. In the context of industrial coordination, the industrial
sectors should not only enhance the emergency response and co-
ordination ability in the industrial chain and supply chain, but also
establish a digital supply chain warning system to identify risks as soon
as possible and make preparations. In addition, we should strengthen
information and communications technology innovation to improve the

information integration level for ensuring epidemic prevention.


4.2. Analysis of the individual network characteristics


In Table 1, the poor performance of individual centrality in various
industrial sectors is the main reason for the poor overall performance of
the industrial sectors’ IIN. The performance of degree centers shows
that the number one railway, shipping, aerospace, and other transpor-
tation equipment manufacturing industry was very different from the
number one water production and supply industry. The top three
railway, shipping, aerospace, and other transport equipment manu-
facturers showed a serious imbalance between point of entry and point
of exit. Especially upstream C31 of the industrial sectors’ chain, this
could bring about more innovation information spillover to the down-
stream industrial sectors. However, its point-out degree is only 1, while
the point-in degree is 15. The power, heat, gas, and water production


and supply industrial sectors (D44‒46) were the worst performing.
However, the strong information relationship accounts for a relatively
high proportion, indicating that the related industrial sectors can
achieve better two-way information spillover. As can be seen from the
proportion of strong information relationship, except for D46, the
proportion of strong information relationships in most other industrial
sectors is relatively low. That is to say, the information relationship
between most industrial sectors is one-way. III among industrial sectors
is weak, and the driving effect of industrial sectors’ information in-
tegration is poor.


With the rapid development of 5 G technology, the manufacturing
sector needs to be incorporated into other industrial sectors through
information and communications technology. However, in fourth place,
its points-out degree is only two above the point-in degree. Of the 38
industrial sectors, only 14 are information-related. The two-way strong
information correlation ratio accounts for only 42.857%, indicating

that China still faces many obstacles to achieve the goal of intelligent
manufacturing through information and communications technology. It
can be seen from the performance of betweenness centrality that C37,
C39, and C31 rank as the top three, indicating that these industrial
sectors are in the position of intermediary bridges in the IIN. By con-
trast, a total of five of the 38 industrial sectors had a betweenness
centrality of 0. They are oil and gas extraction, agricultural and sideline
food processing, and water production and supply, indicating that these
five industrial sectors are on the edge of the IIN. The mean value of
closeness is 45.531, and there are 19 industrial sectors above the mean
value. This accounts for half of the total amount, which indicates that
the information distance distribution between the IIN is relatively ba-
lanced, and the length of the accessible path between different in-
dustrial sectors does not differ much. The number one, C39, was most
closely correlated with information integration in other industrial sec-
tors.


According to the three aspects of individual network characteristics,
C37, C31, C39, C30, and other industrial sectors are at the IIN core. The
electricity, heat, gas, and water production and supply sectors were the
worst performing, at the edge of the integration network. The perfor-
mance of the pharmaceutical manufacturing sector, with high and
equal point-in and -out degrees, is better than that of most industrial
sectors. The betweenness centrality and closeness are both above
average, which indicates that China can quickly successfully and re-
spond to a new epidemic outbreak. Generally speaking, the level of the


industrial sectors’ IIN is not high in China, and the mode of strong in-
formation correlation between industrial sectors is relatively low. This
results in the poor effect of industrial sectors’ IIN.


In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, tools based on information
and communication technologies such as health codes are used to
prevent the spread of the epidemic. Supply chains in key fields such as
next-generation information technology, high-end equipment manu-
facturing, and new materials have been greatly affected. On the one
hand, the field of next-generation information technology has achieved
rapid development. Platforms such as Douyin, Kuaishou, and Bilibili
have become effective channels for spreading information such as
epidemic science and prevention and control education. On the other
hand, the information technology-related manufacturing sector is fa-
cing difficulties. Affected by the epidemic, some export-oriented en-
terprises face risks such as delivery difficulties and contract defaults. On
the one hand, new products are used to meet the demand for epidemic
prevention materials, such as treatment drugs, protective equipment,
and testing reagents. On the other hand, the basic research capacity is
weak, and there are cross-industry data barriers and other prominent
problems. The leading enterprises in information and communications
technology have not been negatively affected by the epidemic, and
indeed have made contributions to epidemic prevention and control
work. Enterprises such as Xuzhou Heavy Industry participated in the
construction of Wuhan Huoshenshan and Raytheon Hospitals to help
with epidemic prevention and control. Government departments need

to strengthen policy support for those information areas that can pro-
mote the role of industrial association and industrial clusters. The aim
of these measures is to form more influential industrial sectors’ IIN to
prevent and control infectious diseases like COVID-19.


4.3. Analysis of the block model


The clustering results show that plate I has a total of 11 members:
B6, B7, B8, B9, C22, C23, C25, C26, C32, C43, and D44. Plate II
members (a total of 10) are B10, C16, C20, C28, C29, C33, C39, C40,
C41, and D45. Plate III members (a total of 14) are C13, C14, C15, C17,
C19, C18, C21, C24, C27, C30, C35, C36, C37, and D46. Plate IV
members (a total of three) are C31 microcomputer, C34, and C38.


As can be seen from Table 2 and Fig. 6, the information spillover
effect between plates is weak, and most of the information correlation
exists within plates. Plate I only interacts with plate II, receiving 15
information resources. Plate II has 9 information resources as both the
receiving and the issue number. The mining industrial sector is almost
all located in this sector, and most industrial sectors are in the upstream
of the industrial chain. The other plates are all correlated with each
other in terms of information. The internal information relationship in
plate II is 34 information resources, and the other plates received by the
plate II correspond to 37 information resources. This indicates a strong
bidirectional information spillover. The major industrial sectors are the
materials and information technology sectors, which are the main
driving force of the industrial sectors’ IIN. The number of sending re-
lationships in plate III was 14 information resources, which was sig-
nificantly more than the number of receiving relationships. It has the
largest number of members, mainly in the pharmaceutical sector and
equipment manufacturing sector. The number of plate IV received re-
lationship was 29 information resources, but its information overflow
relationship was for only 10 information resources. This is less than the
number of relations received from other plates, in line with the main
beneficiary plate characteristics.


According to industrial planning, the key industrial sectors to be
focused on in the future include the information revolution, intelligent
manufacturing, biotechnology, green manufacturing, and other im-
portant industrial sectors that generate momentum for industrial sec-
tors’ information integration. As can be seen from Fig. 6, computer,
communications, and other electronic equipment manufacturing; au-
tomobile manufacturing; medicine manufacturing; special equipment
manufacturing; and instrument manufacturing are all located in the
information overflow sectors. However, compared to the number of
internal information relationships, the information spillover effect to
the outside of the plate is not good. The inter plate information in-
tegration effect still needs to be strengthened.


In response to COVID-19, III tools such as artificial intelligence, big
data, industrial Internet, and cloud computing are playing a role in
virus research, prevention and control measures, vaccine development,
and epidemic information dissemination. Practical input and digital
integration, through the development of digital platforms and specia-
lized applications, open digital infrastructure, and algorithmic cap-
abilities, provide a solid foundation for the fight against the epidemic.
However, there are still some deficiencies in core technologies and in-
dustrial systems, such as weak safety awareness, insufficient technology
innovation, and incomplete system construction. To address these
shortcomings, an open, innovation-driven 5 G technology system
should be applied to the innovation of technology, products, and
business models, and serve the governance of public health practices. In
addition, a 5 G technology system should be embedded into other in-
dustrial sectors to realize information linkage in industrial fields like
technology, business, products, etc. Government departments should
take the lead in using online and cloud-based technologies and pro-
viding more favorable policies in terms of investment proportion and
credit support.


4.4. Analysis of the effect of the network characteristics on network
performance


In Table 3, although point centrality and closeness have significant
positive effects on IIN performance in terms of random effects, the
Hausman test supports a fixed effect.


According to Model 1, the point centrality has a positive effect on
IIN performance, but the result is not significant. The point centrality of
industrial sectors may have a positive effect on IIN performance.
However, the unreasonable information connection mode of the in-
tegration network creates a serious imbalance. The industrial sectors in
the upstream of the industrial chain have no significant effect on the
industrial sectors’ information integration of the downstream sectors.
However, the positive relationship indicates that the industrial sectors
can try to establish more information technology-related channels with
upstream and downstream and related industrial sectors. Doing so can
enhance the point centrality and balance the relationship between the
degree of input and the degree of output to enhance the linkage effect of
information integration between industrial sectors.


According to Model 2, the betweenness centrality has a positive
influence on the IIN performance, and the result has significance above
5%. The betweenness centrality can positively improve the IIN perfor-
mance. The industrial sectors on the edge of the IIN need to actively
expand the upstream and downstream business and improve their po-
sition as an information bridge in the industrial chain. The industrial
sector needs to improve the performance of its own industry indirectly
through the IIN of adjacent industrial sectors.


According to Model 3, the closeness to the center has a positive
effect on IIN performance, but it also fails to pass the significance test in
the fixed-effects model. This suggests that an increase in closeness may
increase the IIN performance. The improvement of closeness can
shorten the information integration distance of various industrial sec-
tors and eliminate the cost of information technology convergence.
However, due to the large industry barriers between various industrial
sectors in the current IIN, the information integration effect of in-
dustrial sectors is not ideal. More marginal industrial sectors is why the
fixed effects model is not significant.


As a sudden exogenous shock, the outbreak and spread of COVID-19
has caused widespread concern and significantly reduced the scale of
various production activities. To a large extent, COVID-19 restricts the
development of industrial sectors’ information integration activities.
There is no doubt that the COVID-19 epidemic is an important test of
China's industrial sectors’ information integration capacity. The fol-
lowing measures should be taken to solve the above problems. How the
industrial system supports the development of the social security
system and biosafety system should be explored to make up for the
shortcomings in the existing industrial sectors’ IIN. Information tech-
nology innovation and entrepreneurship should be strengthened to
explore new forms of industrial sector information integration.
Industrial sectors’ IIN should be strengthened to establish the industrial
sector and health sector collaboration mechanism. A tolerant and open
institutional system and policy environment should be improved to
encourage technology innovation such as the Internet of Things, big
data, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing. Policies such as
priority review, patent compensation, and data protection for drug
trials should be formulated to speed up the development of new drugs
for epidemics such as COVID-19.


5. Conclusions and implications


To respond to COVID-19, it is essential to promote industrial sectors’
information integration. The study introduced the idea of the gravity
mode to study the sector information distance variable and construct
the industrial sectors’ IIN. The overall trend, individual characteristics,
and block model of the industrial sectors’ IIN were analyzed. On this
basis, we further studied the influence of the current state of the

network characteristics on the IIN performance. The study has im-
portant significance. The study is helpful to grasp the changing laws
and trends of information integration within industrial sectors and re-
spond to changes in COVID-19 prevention and control. The study pro-
vides a basis for industrial sectors’ IIN governance, and improves IIN
performance. In addition, this study not only helps to clarify the un-
derlying mechanism by which COVID-19 affects industrial sectors’ in-
formation integration, but also has important practical significance for
improving the level of IIN for public health governance.


The results of this study are as follows. (i) The overall density of
industrial sectors’ IIN fluctuates. It has shown a downward trend in the
past two years and reached its lowest level in 2018. The network effi-
ciency presents a slow rising trend, and the overall IIN stability is poor.
Although the rigid hierarchy of industrial sectors is gradually breaking
down, the overall closeness of the information integration network
needs to be strengthened. (ii) The railway, shipbuilding, aerospace, and
other transportation equipment manufacturing sector, as well as the
computers, communications, and other electronic equipment manu-
facturing sector are at the heart of the industrial sectors’ IIN. Electricity,
heat, gas, and water production and supply sector have the worst per-
formance in three dimensions in the edge of the network. Most in-
dustrial sectors have a one-way, weak information correlation, and the
effect of industrial sectors’ information integration is not obvious. The
information spillover effect of industrial sectors in the upstream of the
industrial chain is poor, and it is difficult to have a strong effect on the
downstream industry. (iii) Most of the plates belong to the interplate
effect. The information linkage effect is poor, especially for the first
plate, with only a plate II information overflow relationship. Plate II is
at the core of the industrial sectors’ IIN, while the network with plate III
provides information overflow to the main engine. (iv) The individual
betweenness centrality has a significant positive effect on the IIN per-
formance. Although point centrality and closeness have positive effects
on the network performance, they are not significant.


The implications for the development of industrial sectors’ IIN and
their response to public health events such as COVID-19 are as follows.


While focusing on the development of key areas, we should also
clearly recognize the loose structure of the industrial sectors’ IIN. The
government should actively explore new channels of industrial sectors’
information integration, and set up an information integration platform
through multiple pathways. In addition, the government should not
only promote the information integration of the upstream industry
through the downstream industry, but also force the downstream in-
dustry to improve the industrial sectors’ IIN via two-way strong corre-
lations. The information linkage effect within and between plates
should be taken seriously to improve policy development. The gov-
ernment should act on the main information spillover sector and the
two-way information spillover sector by formulating targeted industrial
policies. In particular, the government should actively strengthen the
information bridge function and promote the development of industrial
sectors’ IIN.


In the context of industrial sectors’ coordination, the industrial
sectors should not only enhance emergency response and coordination
in the industrial chain and supply chain, but should also establish a
digital supply chain warning system based on emergencies and identify
risks. Tools based on information and communication technologies such
as health codes should be widely used to prevent the spread of the
epidemic. The government should provide more favorable policies in
terms of investment proportion and credit support for effective pre-
vention and control of epidemics such as COVID-19. A tolerant and
open institutional system and policy environment would encourage
technology innovation such as the Internet of Things, big data, artificial
intelligence, and cloud computing. In addition, policies such as priority
review, patent compensation, and data protection for drug trials should
be formulated to speed up the development of new drugs for epidemics
such as COVID-19.


Although this study has made some important contributions, it also


has some shortcomings. The improvement of this industrial sectors’ IIN
is not explored in depth in the study. How the IIN can be optimized
should be the focus of future research on epidemic prevention and
control. In addition, the networks in different countries and between
countries should be studied through the fuzzy set method.
