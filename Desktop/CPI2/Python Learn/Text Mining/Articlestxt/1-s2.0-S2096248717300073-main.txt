We address the rise of the knowledge society, reviewing the major contributors to its
conceptualization from Karl Marx onward. Synthesizing their ideas, we characterize the
current state and direction of the knowledge society, its connection to related ideas of
digital economy, e-government, and others, and detail implications for business and other
organizations, and for society at large.

1. Introduction


The concerns of corporate executives, policy makers, and students planning careers turn increasingly to the knowledge
economy. What does it mean? What are its imperatives for organizations? Is it the far future, the near future, or is it already
here?


This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the historical roots and recent debates around the knowledge society
and digital economy. Based on a review of some key contributions to the field, it derives the contours of today's knowledge-
based activities and their implications for business, not-for-profit enterprises, and society more broadly.


There is as yet no theory of the knowledge society. The paper is motivated not by a gap in theory, then, but by the gap
between the pace of technological and social change on the one hand, and the pace of business and policy adaptation on the
other hand. Further motivation comes from the varying accuracy of past predictions about the knowledge society, and current
disagreements among pundits. We thus trace the development of thought on the knowledge society and the knowledge
economy, believing that understanding their historical trajectories can lead to a better apprehension of their future, and
hence more effective action.

We find roots of the idea of a knowledge society in the 1858 writings of Karl Marx, and we recap key writings from then
through the present. From Marx, we move forward in time to Schumpeter (1930s and 1940s); Masuda's 1980 view of the
knowledge society in Japan; Drucker's 1993 Post-Capitalist Society; Soete (2000); Conceiç~ao, Gibson, Heitor, and Sirilli (2001);
later researchers addressing global and regional implications of the knowledge revolution; and, finally, recent additions from
the trade press. Based on this literature review, we summarize the current status and new directions of the knowledge
economy, and draw implications for management and policy.


Pertinent writings refer to knowledge society, digital society, post-capitalist society, digitalization, digital transformation,
or industry 4.0. The knowledge society encompasses more than the knowledge economy or the digital economy, including
such things as e-government, online education, digital medicine, and online volunteer work, e.g., the SETI project and protein
folding.1 Post-capitalist society, as we shall see when reviewing Peter Drucker's work, means acknowledging that knowledge
is a true factor of production in today's world, and that knowledge workers hold the economy's reins as much as or more so
than capitalist investors. Industry 4.0 refers to the increased digitalization of manufacturing, especially including robotics.
Later in this paper, we draw an “organization chart” of these concepts, showing how our analysis reveals their inter-
relationships.


Table 1, contrasting the old economy with that which is and is to come, suggests the profound changes that have arisen
from the rise of digitalization and knowledge, regardless of what that transition is called. The changes will disrupt markets
and society in ways more radical than any “disruptive technologies” (as we usually call them) can do. Progress toward the
digital society is marked by punctuations and hiccups, and opposed by powerful entrenched interests, but is inexorable.


As for whether the digital economy is here yet, Table 2 (reproduced from an IBM website) shows that it certainly is. In-
formation and communication technologies, combined with Moore's Law, have produced the networks of alliances that blur
industry boundaries.


Tett (2016) cites a McKinsey study claiming “digitization influences up to 98% of the US economy,” due to the high
penetration of the Internet and smartphones. “The annual growth rate of e-commerce is dependably robust, vacillating
between 15 and 17 percent since 2010.” Corporations’ most popular digital transformation tools as of 2016 are cloud
computing and storage, big data analytics, social media, and mobile apps.2 These statements, powerful though they are,
reflect the narrow view of IT service vendors and consultants. They do not reflect the sociological, organizational, and market
changes that truly characterize the knowledge society.


We turn now to examining how it got this way. Adam Smith (1720e1790) referred to “new layers of specialists who are
men of speculation and who made important contributions to the production of economically useful knowledge” (Parry,
2016). In this early juxtaposition of “knowledge” and “economy,” Smith was referring to entrepreneurs and investors
knowing where to put their funds. This was a very different usage than that which concerns us at present. Knowledge now
resides in workers and consumers.

2. Karl Marx (1858)


AlthoughMarx'sDas Kapital is most commonly remembered for its insistence that the rise of the proletarian laborerwould
destroy capitalism, Karl Marx (1818e1883) held a parallel, seldom cited theory (Marx,1858; see also; Fuchs, 2016) to the effect
that knowledgewould “blow [capitalism] sky-high.” In his Grundrisse (1858), Marx was the first to write that “knowledge has
become a direct force of production,” an observation that Frederick Taylor would first put into practice 40e50 years later.

Capital itself is the moving contradiction, [in] that it presses to reduce labour time to a minimum, while it posits
labour time … as sole measure and source of wealth …. On the one side, then, it calls to life all the powers of
science and of nature, as of social combination and of social intercourse, in order to make the creation of wealth
independent (relatively) of the labour time employed on it. On the other side, it wants to use labour time as the
measuring rod for the giant social forces thereby created, and to confine them within the limits required to
maintain the already created value as value. Forces of production and social relationsdtwo different sides of the
development of the social individualdappear to capital as mere means, and are merely means for it to produce
on its limited foundation. In fact, however, they are the material conditions to blow this foundation sky-high.

How remarkable that Marx not only anticipated the rise of knowledge as a factor of production, but connected it to “social
relations.” Today, factory automation, self-driving vehicles, ATMs, etc. minimize the use of labor, for exactly the reasons Marx
adduced, and leverage online social networks for advertising and pricing. As Marx foresaw in broad outline, however, or-
dinary people use “social knowledge” to fight back, via TripAdvisor reviews, online access to restaurant health inspection
reports, video recording of police actions, and so on (see Campbell & David, 2016; Milan, 2016).


Marx was not clear on whether he referred to knowledge for creating machines or knowledge for using machines (the
latter being Taylor's emphasis). Either way, Marx's was an impressive bit of foresight.

3. Joseph Schumpeter (1943)


Schumpeter, as is well-known, put forward innovation as the driver of the economy. Innovation, of course, requires
knowledge. All historical industrial revolutions and Kondratieff waves, however, have been driven by innovation. Schum-
peter's work is pertinent to the knowledge revolution first because Schumpeter (1943), like Marx, emphasized sociological
forces: “Economic life goes on in a social and natural environment which changes and by its change alters the data of eco-
nomic action”; and second because Schumpeter anticipated social knowledge not just as a factor of production, but as a driver
of change in the means of production.

4. Yoneji Masuda (1980)


Yoneji Masuda (1905e1995) was a pioneer of computerization in Japan. Beginning with Japan's first computer white paper
in the mid-1960s, he developed the “Plan for Information Society: A National Goal toward the Year 2000.” Following is an
extract from one of his best-known books, The Information Society as Post-Industrial Society, published in English in 1980
(Masuda, 1980).

We see that human history has accepted three types of society: hunting, agriculture and industry. It is important
to note that the rapid innovation of the social technology system is often the driving force that brings about these
social transformations.


The transformation of society is the result of innovation that has focused on productivity. Current social tech-
nology innovation does not care about the productivity of material products, but information productivity. At the
same time, it is also expected to bring about fundamental changes in human values, ideological trends, social
politics and economic structure.

[In] industrial societies, the dynamism of the invention of the steam engine rapidly increased material pro-
ductivity, making the mass production of goods and services and the rapid transport of goods possible.


In the information society, an ‘information revolution’ resulting from development of the computer will rapidly
expand information productive power, and make possible the mass production of cognitive, systematised in-
formation, technology and knowledge.

This too was extraordinary foresight. Only now have Western economists begun to question their focus on material
productivity (Turner, 2016).


Masuda also believed that in the information society, (1) information, the axis of socio-economic development, will be
produced by the information utility company, the computer-based public infrastructure; (2) user-generated information will
increase and information will accumulate, and cumulative information will be expanded through synergistic production and
sharing; and (3) the economy will shift from a structured exchange economy to a synergistic economy.


In the industrial society, Masudawrote, social activities were enterprises, economic groupsdwhether in the private sector,
the public enterprise, or the third sector of government ownership with private management. In the information society, the
most important issue of social activity will be voluntary communities, a socio-economic group that can be broadly divided
into local communities and information communities.


Masuda further wrote that the spirit of the information society is also the spirit of the revival of emancipating the human
mind, which morally means respect for basic human rights, emphasizing personal dignity and brotherly love to correct the
spirit of inequality. The spirit of the information society will be the spirit of globalism, the coexistence of harmony between
man and nature, including moral self-discipline and social contribution.

5. Peter Drucker (1993)


Aswe try to divine the direction of the knowledge economydand the eventual digital societydwe can do no better than to
revisit the later work of Schumpeter's prot�eg�e, the late business historian Peter Drucker (1909e2005).


In particular, his Post-Capitalist Society (1993) inspires and informs the present essay. Although Drucker disingenuously
maintained Post-Capitalist Society was not a work of foresight,3 it is instructive to catalog, from today's standpoint which
trends he thought important in 1992 did accelerate, and which fizzled. Drucker's brilliance could bring to light the forces
underlying socio-economic evolution, but could not always foresee how the forces would play out.


In this section, we will note what Drucker got right, in terms of forecasts, and what he failed to anticipate. Using this
information and his further insights, we assess aspects of the state of the digital/knowledge economy/society and its many
remaining maturation challenges.

5.1. Drucker's thesis


In Post Capitalist Society (1993), Peter Drucker writes that historically, both in West and East, knowledge had always been
seen as effete, something pursued by society's upper crust, quite unconnected to daily work.


Then, almost overnight, it came to be applied to doing …. Beginning after 1700dand within an incredibly short fifty
yearsdtechnology was invented. The very word is a manifesto in that it combines “techn,” that is, the mystery of a craft
skill, with “logy,” [knowledge].


Drucker is implying that craft does not become knowledge until it is made communicable, and is communicated.4 He
credits operations research pioneer Frederick Taylor for being first to systematically apply knowledge to work processes, and
communicate his findings. “The application of knowledge to work created developed economies by setting off the produc-
tivity explosion of the last hundred years,” Drucker writes (1993).


Drucker placed the modern beginning of the knowledge society in the post-World War II years, citing the technological
advances of the war years and the determination of the postwar Japanese government to collect knowledge as a resour-
cedmaking that country the first non-Western nation in modern times to become a “great economic power.” Yet as a trigger
for the knowledge economy, Drucker (1993) writes,


My own candidate would be the American G.I. Bill of Rights after World War II, which gave every returning American
soldier themoney to attend a universitydsomething that would havemade absolutely no sense only thirty years earlier, at
the end of World War I. The G.I. Bill of Rightsdand the enthusiastic response to it on the part of America's

cker (1993) wrote that Post-Capitalist Society is “a book that is not prediction but description, a book that is not futuristic but a call to action here and


id and Foray (2002) agree with Drucker that knowledge is possessed by a community. Grant (1996) disagrees, saying knowledge is “residing within
ividual.” Grant goes on to say, however, that there is difficulty even in defining “knowledge.” He defers to the great philosophers on that question.






F. Phillips et al. / International Journal of Innovation Studies 1 (2017) 175e191 179

veteransdsignaled the shift to the knowledge society. Future historians may well consider it the most important event of
the 20th century. We are clearly still in the middle of this transformation.


Although in Drucker's (1993) words “the last of the mutations that created the Megastate, the Cold War State, was a
response to technology,” the knowledge economy ultimately weakened the nation-state (see also Phillips & Linstone, 2016).
Drucker chastises conservative economists for believing we can go back to strong nation-states, and political scientists and
constitutional lawyers for hitching political theory too tightly to the idea of the nation-state.


What replaces the state, Drucker maintained, is the relationship between knowledge workers and organizations. An or-
ganization needs knowledge workers to carry out its mission and turn a profit; knowledge workers need organizations as
platforms to practice their knowledge. “Developed countries are fast becoming pluralist societies of organizations,” Drucker
(1993) states, and as a result, non-economic valuesd“redemption, self-renewal, spiritual growth, goodness, and virtuedare
likely to be seen again as existential rather than social goals or political prescriptions”.


In traditional work, “the worker is servant to the machine,” e.g., the clock or the speed of the assembly line. However,
according to Drucker (1993), “In knowledge work and in most service work, the machine (if any) is a servant to the worker.”
Althoughmany of us feel computers too often tell us what to do, Drucker's distinction is a cogent one: “Knowledge is now fast
becoming the sole factor of production, sidelining both capital and labor”.


“How knowledge behaves as an economic resource,” Drucker (1993) goes on, “we do not yet fully understand.” This is as
true now as in 1993. At least we do know that “the knowledge-based economy does not behave the way existing theory
assumes an economy to behave …. High-tech industry does not follow the supply-demand equations of classical, neo-
classical, and Keynesian economics”.


Why is all this “post-capitalist”? First, it is because of the new primacy of knowledge as a factor of production, and second
because the biggest investors in today's enterprises are pension funds. These are not the traditional independent capitalists
who take personal risk with stakes or loans from others; pension fund managers are employees of the fund, having different
risk and agency profiles from their capitalist forerunners. Drucker believed the age structure of developed countries implies
pension funds will become the “universal ownership mode” in these countries.


“It is no longer even possible to make huge profits by controlling money,” Drucker (1993) writesd“The same forces which
destroyed Marxism as an ideology and Communism as a social system are … also making Capitalism obsolescent.”

5.2. Where Drucker nailed it


In line with what Phillips (2008) called “bounded futures,” Drucker noted that “What is unlikely is easier to forecast than
what is likely.” However, he did make a number of accurate forecasts, as well as astute perceptions of 1993 that remain true
today:


▪ “The developed countries will be inundated by a human flood of Third World immigrants.”
▪ “A … severe problem is the diversion of the scarcest resourcesdtrained engineers and scientistsdto economically un-
productive defense work. In the United States, 70 percent of all money spent on research and development is spent on
defense work.”


▪ “The United States has spent enormous sums of money on technology transfer from defense research to civilian products.
The results have been close to zero.”


▪ “GATT (the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade), while clearly meant to impose transnationalism in … foreign trade,
has rarely prevailed against national interests.”

5.3. Yet Drucker failed to anticipate


Drucker (1993) wrote that rich people “have become celebrities, [but] economically, they have almost ceased to matter….
And such talk of money as there is, is about the ‘excessive salaries’ and bonuses of these hired hands [i.e., managers], who
themselves own little or nothing.” On the contrary, disparities of both income and wealth result from and bedevil today's
knowledge economy.


Drucker similarly did not anticipate today's extreme political polarization, runaway “free trade” agreements (Phillips,
2004), the gig economy destroying pensions, the boom in artificial intelligence, or increased government surveillance, all
of which do much to shape life today. Nor did Drucker foresee the crash of the Japanese economy, later in the 1990s.


“The institutions of capitalismwill survive,”Drucker (1993) wrote, “although some, such as banks, may play quite different
roles.” Much as we might wish for banks to play a better-citizen role, the banks post-crash seem to be back to business as
usual.5

5 Not (directly) because they control money, but because of their excessive influence over governments.






F. Phillips et al. / International Journal of Innovation Studies 1 (2017) 175e191180

Another astute Drucker (1993) distinction, “Technology's impacts are predictable in principle; technology developments
are not,” is perhaps broadly true, but incremental developments are predictable, and “in principle” is not good enoughdas we
suddenly realize when a new technology evinces a completely off-the-wall 2nd- or 3rd-order impact.


Finally, Drucker believed that prior to the 1700s, knowledge may have been used in one specific application, but was never
developed into general principles that could find application elsewhere. We might add that our ancestors had no under-
standing that there could be general principles. The Celts and ancient Egyptians, for example, were splendid engineers, but
there is no evidence that they developed science.

6. Luc Soete (2000)


Soete (2000) discussed the cultural and social challenges of digital society. He pointed out that the digital economy cannot
be limited to issues of electronic commerce, as ease of communication and access to information and data are essential
ingredients of social interaction and democratic expression as well as of economic activities.


Written only four years after the launch of the World Wide Web, Soete's prescient paper argued that:


� Commerce will have to consider the particular features and relative merits of physical versus electronic communication
and exchange including money exchange. The development of markets in cyberspace thus requires substantial human
intervention.


� The three essential conditions for the exchange of material goodsdexcludability, rivalry, and transparencyddo not hold in
the exchange of a pure information item.


� Property rights safeguards such as encryption and watermarks will be a central focus of most policy documents on e-
commerce. Without these rules creating excludability, Soete wrote, no optimal level of production can be achieved and
little indication can be obtained of the sort of products that are wanted by potential buyers.


� Because e-commerce reaches a global customer base, it will increasingly raise issues about competition policy to deal with
the “winner takes all'' feature of many digital, non-rivalry goods.


� Issues of open standards, compatibility, universal access, inter-connectivity, democratic control, privacy, and new legal and
moral issues of collective responsibility will increasingly influence existing competition rules. New questions about data
protection and consumer privacy will have to be addressed, with the emergence of new intermediaries competing for
access to customer data.


� Continuous upgrading and versioning of goods and services will raise new policy issues, and many other directly policy-
relevant issues going beyond traditional economic policy concerns (e.g., the question of who “owns” purchased software).


� The real growth of electronic commerce will not lie in the simple substitution of physical commerce by electronic com-
merce. Rather, it will lie in what he called “e-exchange,” i.e., the opportunities offered by electronic networks for new
forms of exchange and communication across businesses, between businesses and consumers, and between consumers to
generate value out of such new forms of exchange.


� In the short term, the information highways are likely to significantly reduce costs due to the ease of electronic access and
the available databases on products and suppliers. Transaction costs are thus likely to fall and existing intermediary costs
decline (This indeed happened; Satell (2015) noted, “So, in effect, the Coasean model has been turned on its head.
Technology has minimized transaction costs, while organizational costs have become a heavy burden.”).


Soete predicted the growth of Internet-enabled outsourcing, with electronic exchange likely to lead to substantial reor-
ganization of markets with the value chain shifting across business, and the activities that are not part of the core
manufacturing or service production of the firm now carried out more efficiently outside of the firm, in specialized
companies.


The digital revolution, Soete wrote, will allow not just internal re-engineering processes in the public sector, but also new
forms of outsourcing and public-private partnerships. Many areas dominated by public authorities and public service pro-
viders such as education, health, culture, media, social services, immigration, police, libraries, and other local services, he
added, are typically bound by the geographical limits of the country, province, region, or townwithinwhich they operate and
are administered. This constrains the growth of their online user bases, compared to the global reach of e-commerce sites.


While the information revolution contributes to increased efficiency in economic production and distribution (and, we
add, disposal/recycling), it creates in the first instance increased consumer satisfaction, increased welfare, and freedom of
communication and exchange. It is in this sense that the information society takes on its true value, for leisure, household, and
other so-called “non-work” activities.


Soete argues that easy access to these new “immaterial” goods and services represents the newwealth of the 21st century.
Typically (or, rather, ideally), these are goods and services that in their consumption do not lead to the sort of happiness
paradox (first identified in the 1960s by Tibor Scitovsky (1992)) that is characteristic of traditional material consumption.


Seventeen years later, all but one of Soete's predictions have eventuated. Even the one exceptiondpolicies attempting to
bestow exclusivity on informational goods (the third bulleted item above)dis still practiced, but has become widely scorned,
seen as incumbent firms' digging in their heels in resistance to information's tendency to zero marginal cost.

7. Pedro Conceiç~ao, David Gibson, Manuel Heitor, and Georgio Sirilli (2001)


Conceiç~ao et al. (2001) discussed the emergence of the learning society in tandem with the knowledge economy. They
proposed that in a learning society, individuals, firms, and organizations are not merely consumers but actively and
continuously seek to nurture, manage, and harvest their knowledge assets.


In this respect, innovation and learning are not limited to immediate technical advances or their applications (including
information and communication technologies, ICTs). Changes in the regulatory framework of an industry, shifts in consumers’
tastes, demographic makeovers, or even alterations of global geopolitics are considered innovations that affect the devel-
opment of a learning society. Consequently, the digital economy and the learning society should be viewed through theo-
retical lenses that accommodate the broader understanding of innovation and learning. The “techno-economic paradigm”
(Freeman & Perez, 1986) is one such framework, duly addressing the limitations of the traditional economic viewpoints.


Techno-economic paradigms (TEPs) mainly form by organizing the economic activity around a set of core technologies.
When the potential of existing technologies exhaust (or disruptive innovations occur), technical advances and entrepre-
neurial activities lead to new techno-economic paradigms. A set of core technologies is selected by the market, and the
development and diffusion of most products and services hinge on that set of core technologies.


Freeman, Clark, and Soete (1982) identified major techno-economic paradigms: early mechanization in the 1700s, steam
engine and railways around the mid-1800s, electrical and heavy engineering from the end of the 1800s to the 1940s, Fordist
mass production from the 1930se1980s, and, finally, ICTs from the 1970s onwards.


The new digital economy and the learning society exist in the current (fifth) techno-economic paradigm, in which
innovation and learning practices are largely reliant on electronics, computers, telecommunications networks, and the
Internet. An array of opportunities has opened up in all areas of living, business, education, research, healthcare, travel, and
farming, and there is no apparent end to its potential.


The current ICT-based TEP brought radical changes to the modern firm, for instance, newer business models, improved
ways of working without constraints of time and space, and new media/modes of collaboration. All that is on top of the
productivity gains appropriable through process and incremental innovations. The digital product/services/apps innovations
in the current ICT-based techno-economic paradigm have brought unprecedented higher returns, hence the new digital
economy.


Large variations in the productivity/growth/income of different countries/regions essentially indicate differences in their
ability to innovate within the current TEP based on ICTs. In the neo-Schumpeterian tradition, the notions of technological
trajectories (Dosi, 1982) and national innovation systems (Freeman, 1982, 1987; Lundvall, 1992; Nelson, 1991) provide an
explanation. A national innovation system is typically a snapshot of diverse types of innovation actors in a country, their
interactions, and the institutional conditions within which they innovate. Technological trajectories on the other hand depict
evolutionary progression of the technological capabilities and assets of an organization or country. Therefore, based on the
path-dependencies carved by their unique historical and other contextual conditions, a country (region or firms therein) can
only learn (accumulate knowledge) and make progress around specific technological trajectories within the prevalent
techno-economic paradigm.


Technology policy plays a large role in shaping the conditions to move up the existing or new technological trajectories,
and to foster economic progress within the current TEP.


Because the process efficiency potential of ICTs have been to a large extent exhausted during the early period of the current
TEP, there is an increasing need to focus on nurturing a learning society with competencies in economics, management,
engineering, and technology. The digital economy has to shift to a learning economy based on innovations by a maximum
number of members of the learning society.


Therefore, public policy that leaves everything (or most) to the markets to shape the new digital economy would not be
helpful for successful economic progress. In fact, the role of policy should be to actively leverage the potential of ICTs for
transformation of information to knowledge and its sharing within and across borders to support learning, knowledge
accumulation, and innovation at individual and collective levels. In this regard, education and research agendas supporting
the quality of human resources and activities oriented toward the generation and diffusion of knowledge should be top
priorities of technology policy.


Successful technology policy for the current TEP should specifically entail:


� Targeting growth of knowledge-based industries.
� Developing social capital well-versed in ICTs, through education and research programs.
� Successfully commercializing scientific R&D outputs in the form of technical and organizational innovations.
� Measuring and monitoring the development of innovation and learning society in an appropriate way.


These authors conclude that to foster a peaceful future, technology policy in the current TEP should also focus on building
institutions and supporting conditions for learning and knowledge accumulation at the global level (knowledge society at
global level).

Cluster theorists and economic geographers (e.g., Lundvall, 1992; see also; Phillips, 2017) emphasize that regional eco-
nomic development, and productivity within the firm, are now served by deliberate sharing of knowledge as well as by
accidental knowledge spillover and face-to-face transfer of tacit knowledge (Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995).

8. Robert Ayres and Eric Williams (2004)


Ayres and Williams (2004) valuably recapitulated the information/communication technology (ICT) developments and
technology policy developments that underpinned knowledge society early in the new century. They emphasized the “huge
amount of misdirected investment” resulting from the untested business models of Internet startups, from the dotcom crash
of the late 1990s, from the spate of doomed mergers, and from the Netscape vs. Microsoft browser bundling lawsuit, which
broke new legal grounddthe law not being prepared for the digital future.


Ayres and Williams (2004) forecast that although the “use of cell phones for communicating text, pictures, and video is a
rapidly expanding area, it seems unlikely that these applications will have a macroeconomic impact.” They did turn out to
have a profound social impact, however, and ultimately economic impact via m-commerce, GPS-driven transportation effi-
ciencies, etc. (Of course, as Ayres and Williams note, these applications depended on cellular networks changing over from
analog to digital, which in the U.S. did not happen until the 1990s. The same decade saw the inception of HDTV, digital
television.)


Indeed, the Ayres and Williams paper, when departing from ICT technicalities, did address the knowledge society more
than the digital economy, focusing on such changes as telework. They were pessimistic about the ability of telework tech-
nology to handle group tasks. Today, Google Docs, Google Hangouts, and many other facilities from multiple vendors have
solved that problem more or less adequately.


They pointed out that digital society preceded digital economy in a sense, with the U.S. Census Bureau adopting electronic
computers in the 1950sdand the military before thatdwhile business adoption did not take off until the late 1950s.


In 2003, “Most business users of computers were, and still are, companies in the service sectors” (Ayres&Williams, 2004).
This has changed, as Industry 4.0 places networked robots on the manufacturing floors of America and other countries.


A spot-on forecast by Ayres and Williams was that music would be downloadable as individual songs, rather than as
bundled albums, for about a dollar each. Like Soete, they foresaw the privacy issues that plague Internet commerce today.


Ayres and Williams note the convergence of computing and telecommunications technologies that began in the 1960s,
and document the simultaneous drops in bandwidth prices and increases in video compression ratios that today have given
us streaming Netflix.


Although in pre-World Wide Web and pre-big data times, servers were connected only to LANs (local-area networks) and
the demand for servers was limited (Phillips, 1992), by 2003, an incipient “cloud” was driving 50 percent annual increases in
server capacity demand (Ayres & Williams, 2004). Likewise, demanded bandwidth per user was doubling every two years
(Ayres & Williams, 2004). As our appetite for cat videos seems insatiable, and as the Internet of Things takes off, bandwidth
demand seems poised for continued increasesdperhaps beyond the capacity of the Internet that now exists.


Progress of the digital society was perhaps slowed, but also perhaps ultimately of higher quality, due to standards wars
(HDTV vs. HD-MAC, and CDMA2000 vs.W-CDMA) and a U.S. Federal Communications Commission that “was concernedmore
with assuring competition than with encouraging innovation” (Ayres & Williams, 2004). Today, especially following the
surprise 2016 U.S. presidential election outcome, Internet domain name authority and net neutrality debates present similar
challenges.

9. Regional views


9.1. Asia


Guest-editing a special issue of Technological Forecasting & Social Change, Sung (2009) noted that the “OECD officially
acknowledges the digital economy as a new way of conducting business, and recognizes that digital economy has the po-
tential to radically alter economic activities and the social environment.” The digital economy, he says, “allows regional
businesses and economies to be less local andmore global in keeping with long-term trends towardmarket liberalization and
reduced trade barriers”.


Sung's 2009 special issue focused on Asian countries' leveraging of digitization and the knowledge economy in order to
overcome the East-West economic gap left over from traditional economies. He summarizes the findings of contributors to
the special issue:


� In terms of patents won, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, China, and India have leveraged ICT to become
“much larger forces in the world economy”.


� In Taiwan's IC design industry, human capital and relational capital, grown through application of ICTs, “improve new
product development performance through organizational learning capability”.


� IT investment has a positive impact on firm performance in less-developed China, and this impact is similar in direction
and size to that experienced by more developed countries, including the United States. (This was an unexpected result.)






F. Phillips et al. / International Journal of Innovation Studies 1 (2017) 175e191 183

� The density of the networks of Korean industries increased over time (from early 1980s to mid-1990s), “implying that the
knowledge network has expanded and intensified”. However, much remains to be done to advance informatization of
non-ICT-related Korean industries.

9.2. Europe


Rodrigues (2002) writes of “a new European strategy which aims to build a knowledge-based economy with more
competitiveness and social cohesion.” His edited book, with contributions by Lundvall, Soete, and others, also portrays the
knowledge revolution as tied to globalization. Challenges include Europe's relations with America, whether the EUmodel will
closely or loosely tie the member countries, gaps between high-skilled and low-skilled European regions, problems of social
exclusion, and renewing Europe's social welfare traditions in a more competitive world.


Rodrigues (2002) calls the sacrifice of “social and historical context” for the sake of “modelisation and more precise
explanation” a “crucial dilemma,” and comes down on the side of including sociological and historical analysis, as did (he
notes) Veblen and Schumpeter. As advisor to the prime minister during the Portuguese presidency of the EU, Rodrigues saw
this view advanced as a policy. With Europe's knowledge transformation perceived to be lagging America's, a Europe-wide
policy push was called for, with the EU's diverse countries serving as living laboratories for policy options, and “open
coordination”da kind of open innovation initiativedused to collate suggestions and best practices.

10. The recent trade press


We now look at recent thinkers who have published outside the scholarly journals.

10.1. Don Tapscott (1995)


In the mid-1990s, consultant Don Tapscott (1995) recognized the emergence of a “digital economy” led by “networked
intelligence”dan on-going revolutionary transformation of individual and organizational behaviors (and activities), based on
the information available to them plus the potential to communicate and collaborate with each other.


The “networked enterprise,” the fundamental unit of the digital economy, relies on applying human know-how to develop
and offer new products and servicesdoften disruptive, information-intensive, and somewhat intelligent. Two key enablers of
the knowledgework, learning, and disruption in the digital economy are high-speed networks and interactivemultimedia led
by the convergence of content, computing, and communications technologies (industries).


ICTs support the creation of “networked enterprise” at five different levels, each with its own impacts and implications for
the digital economy.


1. Personal multimedia help create a more “effective individual” who is able to carry out personal tasks much more effi-
ciently with high learning competencies.


2. These effective individuals use workgroup computingdleading tomajor changes in organizational business processesdto
become smaller “high-performance teams.”


3. Individuals and smaller teams connect and communicate across the enterprise instantly using digital networks and social
media. Organizational information travels at light speed across the globe, supporting the emergence of an “integrated
enterprise.”


4. However, information sharing is not limited to individuals and teams inside an organization. Using inter-enterprise
computing technologies, external relationships with suppliers, interest groups, competitors, and customers are rede-
signed to bolster the overall performance of the entire value network (replacing industry value chains or supply chains).
Products and services are increasingly developed and distributed with proactive participation of other actors in the value
network. The networked enterprise is an “extended enterprise.”


5. Lastly, putting them all together at a higher level, all value-creation activities can be conceived, implemented, and
distributed entirely in cyberspace. That means a networked enterprise could also become a fully virtual enterprise, or in
other words, “inter-networked business.” Such enterprises are the new source of wealth-creation.


Transformation in any sector or industry, Tapscott maintained, could be described by these five levels.
While the businesses aiming digital transformation grapple with technical issues pertaining to digitization, convergence


(variety), modularization, intangibility, and velocity of information management, their most critical challenges in trans-
formation from traditional enterprise to the networked enterprise are predominantly management challenges. They involve
attracting and retaining a knowledgeable, independent but collaborative workforce, provision of an open communications
environment, and development of trust. These challenges are further aggravated by the issues of privacy, information
asymmetries, changing work-life balance and social relations, and the impact of easy access to negative online (virtual)
experiences.






F. Phillips et al. / International Journal of Innovation Studies 1 (2017) 175e191184

The key argument put forward by Tapscott is although it is the technology that is revolutionary and disruptive, the core
issue of the digital economy remains how the technology largely affects the society, enterprise, and the individual.Wealth and
knowledge divides, privacy, and changing social relations and work conditions would need full and conscious attention.

10.2. Bill Gates (1999a, b)


Microsoft founder Bill Gates (1999a, b) also notes that digital technologies and networks have unleashed unique potentials
for information work and information flows. While the former is about human thought applied to information at the
workplace for problem-solving purposes, the latter implies that information can be instantly exchanged among line workers,
managers, suppliers, customers, and other stakeholders.


Gates sees a Digital Nervous System (DNS) at the heart of this exchange, the organizational brain that bolsters thinking and
collaboration in the workplace and at the boundaries of the business. He emphasized a DNS is imperative for any business or
non-profit that wants to survive in the new economy. A well-functioning DNS allows the firm to answer the harder business
challenges, for instance, building innovative new products or an interactive customer service.


A good communications network, an efficient email (messaging/exchange) system, and a web system (providing online
forms) are the primary building blocks of an effective DNS. Digital transformation looks easier if it was only about technology.
However, corresponding organizational change (learning, adaptation, and capability accumulation) needs much conscien-
tious effort and time, and must be accomplished at a very high speed. It begins with the introduction of simple practices for
collecting, processing, and sharing transactional information at various levels (e.g., a paperless office). Ultimately, it involves
using such information for strategic decision-making. Real-time data, mobile devices, and wireless connectivity open up new
forms of efficiencies in the workplace and on the production floor.


A new web-based lifestyle, flourishing around new forms of content, advertising, and media (Internet/TV/PC combined),
has re-defined the business-customer and government-citizen relationships. The size of the organization does not matter
anymore in the online economydexperience and service levels do. Therefore, softer aspects of management and the skills/
tools for building social relationships are the key differentiators in this increasingly innovative and service-focused landscape.
Online information search, online interactions, communities of interests, and communities of practices inside and outside the
organization will empower employees as well as affect supplier and customer engagement.


Consequently, a DNS plays an important role in raising the “corporate IQ” of the enterprise in the new economy. It directly
improves the most critical antecedents of doing business in the new economy, such as delegation, flexibility, self-service (dis-
intermediation), synergy, and personalization. While physical assets are being transformed into information as much as
possible, interactions are also being turned into experiences with the least number of hand-offs. In order to support speed,
agility, personal initiative, responsibility, and action-orientation, organizations need to instantly identify and share bad news
even more than the good news. Unlike manufacturing industries where information flows for inventory were most impor-
tant, information for risk is what works for the businesses in emerging sectors of the new economy, according to Gates. Some
of the sectors most transformed by DNS, he says, include healthcare, government (public services), and education.

10.3. Paul Mason (2015, 2016)


Mason (2015, 2016) argues that “information is corroding the market's ability to form prices correctly,” even as companies
fight a rear-guard battle, attempting to “own” information and keep its price high through copyright extensions, nondis-
closure and non-compete contracts, and so on. This implies “intellectual property is valued in modern accounting standards
by guesswork.”6 We may expect an unstable stock market until this is resolved.


Mason's article, giving no indication that its author has read Drucker, reiterates Drucker's ideas in a gee-whiz-I-just-
thought-of-this manner. However, Mason states the ideas' implications in powerful ways, shows that they are much more
urgent now than in 1993, and deals with important items that Drucker got wrong (e.g., he notes that “the pension system has
been destroyed”). Where Drucker saw the central conflict of the future as betweenmanagers and knowledge workers, Mason
sees it as between “free and abundant goods and information” and the fragile monopolies that desperately prop up prices.


Mason draws parallels (as did Drucker) between the feudalism-capitalism transition and the capitalism-postcapitalism
transformation. Land shortages and the need for military production attenuated the “values” of feudalism, and the new
capitalist structure was able to arise with little push-back following the crisis of the Black Plague. Indeed, “[a]t key moments,
though tentatively at first, the state switched from hindering the change to promoting it.”7 We now see cracks in the mores
underlying capitalism (the mores that sent MaxWeber into such raptures); terrorism and climate change might be the crises
that fill the role played by the bubonic plague in the mid-1300s.

7 Mason (2016) believes it will not be state, but rather city officials that will first promote the needed reforms. Unlike Drucker, who believed non-
economic values would become personal rather than political, Ida Auken (2016), a member of the Danish parliament (Folketinget), argues that city gov-
ernments, by embracing the digital sharing economy, can facilitate the emotional satisfaction that comes from the digital alternative to the present growth-
obsessed, high-stress, environmentally damaging regime.

11. The foremost thinkers on knowledge society: summary and common threads


11.1. Key dates


Important milestones in the transition to a digital, knowledge-based economy and society have been Karl Marx's long-
ignored Fragment on Machines (1858), Frederick Taylor's work in the early 20th century, the U.S. G.I. bill in 1944, and the
1970s Japanesework on “knowledge society.”Naturally, the Internet (1970s), theWorldWideWeb (1990s), and especially the
more interactive Web 2.0 (early 2000s) were key advances. See Table 3.


Friedman (2016) argues for 2007 as a key date. Late 2006 and 2007, he says, brought us the first iPhone. Facebook opened
itself to non-university users. Twitter, Hadoop, Amazon's Kindle, Google's Android OS, IBM's Watson AI, Airbnb, the GitHub
open-source software library, change.org, and the “cloud” all took off in 2007djust after Internet users had exceeded a billion
in 2006.

11.2. Commonalities and differing views


All the thinkers mentioned in the present historical account8 saw the knowledge revolution as closely tied to social in-
teractions. Some noted that the economics of the knowledge economy are not yet understood. Their consensus on these
points implies there will be no “purely” economic (i.e., centered on price) theory of the knowledge economy; the theory that
will eventually emerge will tie economics to sociology, urban planning, and perhaps other disciplines. It will not be a simple
theory.9


Most of thewriters at least implicitly connected the knowledge revolutionwith a globalized outlook and amore globalized
economy. The easy, costless movement of informationmakes this connection plausible, yet the recent successes of nationalist
political candidates in several major countries make it arguable, for now.


Some of the writers saw the knowledge revolution having more impact on public policy, and some focused more on the
impact on business firms. Conceiç~ao et al., for example, were mainly concerned about the national and policy-level aspects
(and issues) of the learning economy. They emphasized knowledge exchange for international shared prosperity. In contrast,
Tapscott and Gates both discussed how key technological trajectories unfold for a networked enterprise in a front-runner
nation. They did not address the latecomer enterprise (or enterprises from latecomer nations) or variations in their path-
dependencies/contexts.


This contrast pointed up the tension between the companies still trying to monetize information, and the public agencies
that wish to move information more quickly and cheaply for the benefit of citizens. Even among the latter, there are dif-
ferences in emphasis, e.g., Conceiç~ao et al.’s (2001) emphasis on national and international policies on the one hand, and
Mason's (2015) and Auken's (2016) focus on cities as the drivers of the public revolution in leveraging knowledge on the other.
It could be noted here that governments have moved more slowly, making the revolution more an evolution, if only because
governments must obey their own laws. Tech firms (famously, Uber), in contrast, have openly flouted the laws, in the interest
of first-mover advantage.


Some writers view the same aspects of the knowledge revolution from seemingly incompatible angles. Powell and
Snellman (2004) see the revolution characterized by the rise of science-based industries, differing rates of innovation in
different industries, and the nature of work and its effect on firm performance. This differs from the list offered by David and

8 We have tried to represent prominent writers spanning the history of the knowledge society idea. The possibility of accidental selection bias remains.
9 Grant's 1996 paper “Toward a Knowledge-based Theory of the Firm” concedes, “The emerging ‘knowledge-based view’ is not, as yet a theory of the firm.


” Perhaps this is because of bounded rationality, as evidenced by the fact that Grant draws heavily on Cyert's and March's behavioral theory of the firm, even
as he rightly claims that things are different now.

Foray (2002), which emphasizes the accelerating rate of knowledge creation and obsolescence, growing prominence of
intangible capital, the imperative for innovation and change in organizations, and digitalization.


Predictions made by the writers ranged from amazingly prescient to flat-out wrong, and also fell into intermediate po-
sitions on that spectrum. Tapscott's ideas of integrated enterprise, inter-networked enterprise, and enterprise architectures,
and Gate's conceptualization of Digital Nervous Systems bear strong similarities. Both of them laid down technology-based
visions of fast, dynamic, agile, focused, boundary-spanning, collaborative, service-oriented, and knowledge- and innovation-
driven enterprises in the digital economy.


However, they did not foresee the exponentially increasing size and complexity of enterprise infrastructure that resulted
from the above drivers, for example, the Internet of Things, expected to encompass between 20 and 50 billion devices
connected to the Internet by 2020, throwing off torrents of data. Already, more data are now being generated everyweek than
in the last millennia. Consequently, they could not discuss the need for cloud computing, proliferation of online search (to the
extent it has become a sector in itself), the huge impact of social media, and the emergence of big data analytics. They also
focused on security and privacy from the human and organizational perspective, while neglecting the technical side. Their
portrayals of the business future were culture-bound and at most medium-term.


Generally, the many writers’ broader, bolder predictions have proven true, with the detailed predictions about the
mechanisms of change having a more checkered track record. These facts suggest prediction will remain a risky business for
some time to come.

12. Digital economy: status and current directions


In this section, we offer an interpretation of the material presented above, and cautious views of the future.

12.1. Interpretation and synthesis


Knowledge workdactivities that involve complex problem identification, problem solution, or high-technology design
and that result in innovative new products or services or create new ways of exploiting marketsdhas become the driver for
economic growth and individual and organizational prosperity (Neef, 1998, p. 3).


Therefore, one would expect knowledge- and information-intensive industries such as high tech, financial services,
entertainment, health care, education, and government to be those most transformed and benefiting the most from digiti-
zation and the Internet. In the medium term, the most visible effects may be seen in retailing, manufacturing, and travel
(Carlsson, 2004).


Newspapers, music, finance, and travel agents already have been transformed or obliterated. Facebook, Twitter, smart-
phones and the “sharing economy” have perhaps surpassed people's expectations, disrupting established structures and
economic arrangements. Sectors from accommodation to transport have been disrupted as new applications enable new
business services over the Internet. Online video distributors, such as YouTube or Netflix, offer content over broadband
networks, beyond traditional cable and broadcasting services. Changes have been equally profound in telecommunication,
with voice (VoIP) and text services such as WhatsApp, or KakaoTalk offered over the Internet.


Digital technology is reshaping business models and firms’ organization, and making “soft skills,” such as information-
processing, self-direction, problem-solving, and communication, more important. The effects of digital technologies go
beyond employment and skills to the very organization of work, by enabling firms to segment tasks in newways (Grant,1996)
and to increase the use of temporary labor. Digitization and the Internet, in combination with new software, enable com-
panies to collaborate with suppliers and customers in new ways and thereby to raise productivity.


In the oil industry, higher-resolution (3-D) imaging increased the payoff for accurate drilling. This induced companies to
invest in high-tech down-hole sensors. New technology and better oil recovery developed simultaneously, energizing and
reinforcing one another. Knowledge, as much as petroleum, is now the critical resource in the oil business. Although the
supply of oil is “fixed,” the supply of knowledge is boundless (Rauch, 2001, pp. 35e49).


Web technology brings together design engineers in collaborative systems to develop new products. An example is
DaimlerChrysler's FastCar project. The company expects to develop the new car 40 percent faster through its new web-based
system than in a traditional system inwhich geographically dispersed engineers communicate via phone, fax, and e-mail and
where each proposed design change might require days or weeks. As a result, DaimlerChrysler expects to save billions of
dollars on the cost of car development over the next few years (Moozakis, 2000, p. 83). For similar reasons, General Motors
can get a car into production in 18 months rather than the 42 months it took in the mid-1990s (Keenan, Ante, Elgin,& Hamm,
2002).


Digitalization plays an important role in the restructuring of economic activities within industries, for example, in the
defense industry, where more than 80 suppliers will be working at 187 locations to design and build components of the Joint
Strike Fighter. It is up to the 75-member technology group at Lockheed's Aeronautics division to link them all together;
Lockheed and its partners will be using a system of 90 web software tools to share designs, track the exchange of documents,
and keep an eye on progress against goals (Keenan et al., 2002).

12.2. Measurement


The Lockheed example conveys the difficulties of measuring the knowledge economy. It is difficult first because there is
insufficient theory onwhich to build measurement scales, and second because the essential factors of humanmotivation and
preparedness are so difficult to measure.


The OECD (2016) and the Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI; https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/desi)
assess countries' progress toward digitalization, but do not address their cultural contexts, i.e., the surrounding knowledge
societies. The World Economic Forum's “Networked Readiness Index” (http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_GITR_Report_
2013.pdf) does include cultural, legal, human, and business environment measures. However, it too gives outsize emphasis
to computer hardware sales.


The Economist Intelligence Unit's (2010) digital economy survey ranks theworld's 70 largest economies on availability and
integration of information and communications technology (ICT) for social, cultural, political, and economic progress. Top
performing countries show balanced progress on business and legal environments, education, technology policy, and digital
services adoption. The report suggests that the digital divide is narrowing among countries. Mobile data tools and educational
services are progressing faster in the developing world than in rich nations. Educational levels are improving throughout the
world.


The study found that when e-government channels are available, citizens do not necessarily use them. It is a people
problem, not a technological problem. On the other hand, the study found that some governments' heavy-handed control of
citizens’ access to information impedes progress toward a knowledge economy.


The knowledge revolutionwill change what wemust measure, and change the way wemeasure (Phillips, 2014). Al Shami,
Lotfi, Coleman, and Dost�al (2015) have put forward interesting ideas in this regard.

12.3. A concept map


Our recapitulation of 160 years of thought makes it clear that knowledge takes the dominant role in what is happening
today. Digitalization, although hugely important, is just an enabler-facilitator of the knowledge society, and would be neither
necessary nor possible in the absence of the knowledge revolution. How humans interact, in social, business, civic, and
political organizations, is key. Just as the best power tools will not help an incompetent carpenter, the best digital tools will
not empower a dysfunctional organization.


Fig. 1 shows our view of the relationship of the knowledge revolution's main components. The knowledge society en-
compasses commercial, social, governmental, and educational activities, and all four elements are revolutionized by the new
primacy of knowledge as a factor of production. Digitalization supports their respective revolutions, but the revolutions
cannot succeed without trust. Digitization (more properly, digitalization) provides one important element of trust, that is,
secure communication. The remainder of society's trust comes as always from human attitude and experience. This
remainder has not proven scalable beyond workgroups or social groups of a few hundred (Dietz, Ostrom, & Stern, 2003;
D�avid-Barrett & Dunbar, 2013), and many current studies address that barrier.

12.4. The future


The transition to a knowledge economy will feel rapid due to the many changes it entails, but it will take a long time for it
to be complete. As Drucker (1993) warned, we will live for some decades yet in a dual economy: part capitalist, part post-
capitalist.10


Like any revolution in production, the knowledge economy will bring positive and negative externalities, job losses being
highly visible among the latter. We may expect more M&A activity, with its usual failure rate, some of it motivated by false
predictions of economies, some by confusion about industry boundaries, and some by the historical and venal fact that few
CEOs get fired during the course of a merger. The digital economy will present challenges for law, accounting, and banking,
with all the economically unproductive fees that drive those professions.


The environmental benefits of the digital economy will be significant: Savings in paper (and other materials) and in
physical distribution costs may be only the tip of the iceberg, the submarine portion of the berg including reduced pollution
from factories, reduced commuting trips due to telework, and “cell phone lots” at airports. Environmental diseconomies
include the power consumption and cooling requirements of massive data server arrays, possible health threats from
ubiquitous radiation in the Wi-Fi bands, and possible disruption of marine life from laying oceanic fiber optic cables.


The “digital divide” (James, 2002) will persist, with large swaths of the world's population having little access to digital
products and services. Income and wealth inequality may worsen as digital goods become the norm in advanced countries.


The richness and nuance of analog life is missing in the digital society. The unexpected and exciting roar of presses and
newsboys shouting “Extra!” are with us no more; when Donald Trump won the U.S. presidency in an upset, news organi-
zations did exactly what they would do if a meteorite were about to wipe out all Earthly lifedthey quietly updated their
websites. There will be a backlash against the digital transition, and ultimately, a balance will be struck. More than a century
after the industrial revolution, most of theworld's people still lived on farms. Now that balance has reversed, urban gardening
provides many with a satisfying link to the old regime.


Some people will gravitate toward digital machine-like personal behavior (beat-box singing, robotic dancing, excessive
“business process improvement”11) even as others go “more human” (Groth, 2016). A better understanding of rationality and
emotion in human decision-making may emerge.


Knowledge is power; hence, misinformation becomes a weapon. “Spin,” misleading news, and even “fake news” take on
new prominence, and not just in public sources: Tiku (2017) documents that Google's intranet news, aimed at employees,
deliberately misrepresented a court decision that could affect the company's future. An industry will grow around verification
services.


The OECD (1996) recapitulates that this is not just about (price) economics. The OECD report emphasizes power shifts
resulting from the knowledge revolution, and the importance of institutionsdwhich, the report notes, do not yet have the
tools or expertise needed to govern the knowledge society.


13. Consequences for organizations and society


Companies cannot benefit from the knowledge economy by relying on technology alone. Success will hinge on humans’
willingness and ability to assimilate and share information, to make data-based decisions, and to accept new and often
inverted patterns of influence within their organizations.


Knowledge workers have inverted the power structure in companies, especially in high tech firms. Google employees'
success in demanding that their CEO cease engaging with the newly elected administration in Washington may be startling,
but was predictable given the writings of the thinkers cited in this paperdas is the current refusal of technology firm em-
ployees to comply with Trump's “Muslim registry” order.12


Two Forbes columns (Jones & Silberzhan, 2016; McKendrick, 2016) warn against “doing the wrong things even faster,” i.e.,
digitizing legacy business processes without first re-thinking the processes. IT vendors will of course under-emphasize this
necessity in order to sell more computer systems faster. Technology is a means of serving customers better, McKendrick
reminds usdnot an end in itself.


Until a useful socioeconomic theory of the knowledge economy emerges, companies and governments will depend on
experimentation and information-sharing as a substitute for theory-based strategy, as Rodrigues (2002) urged for Europe.
(Kim, Barua, & Whinston, 2002; Kodama, 2015; Phillips, Lin, and Lin, 2017). We may expect some companies to hedge their
bets by establishing a division or skunkworks that embraces the knowledge economywhile the traditional divisions act as the
reactionary incumbents.

11 “Holacracy was developed by software engineer Brian Robertson, who has sold CEOs like [Zappos's] Hsieh on a product that promises to push humans
to run like a computer operating system…. At Zappos, dissatisfaction with holacracy played a role (though it wasn't the only reason) in nearly a third of the
company walking out the door in 2015. That same year, Zappos dropped off of Fortune's ‘Best Companies to Work for list’ for the first time in years” (Groth,
2016).

13.1. Backlash


Companies, especially multinational corporations, now depend on the globalized economy. They will have to manage
tensions with political regimes that advocate nationalist economic policies. They should understand that these regimes have
arisen as inevitable but temporary reactions against the wrenching changes of the knowledge revolution.


Often going hand in hand with nationalism, the long tradition that Hofstadter (1963) called “anti-intellectualism in
American life” is likewise a backlash against the knowledge society. Recent victories of know-nothingism in American
electoral politics have caused the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists to editorialize on “the current great danger to a complex,
technology dependent society,”13 and a professor of National Security Affairs at the U.S. Naval War College to warn of “the
impending death of expertise.”14


Consumers are returning to analog products, e.g., music on vinyl disks in lieu of mp3s (Sarpong, Dong,& Appiah, 2016) and
books on paper rather than e-books (Nicola, 2017). We see a resurgence of “events” of all kinds, including live concerts. The
tourism industry has embraced the “experience economy,” and the “maker movement” moves adherents from coding to
fabricating physical objects. These mild and agreeable forms of backlash are business opportunities.


Products will combine analog and digital features, e.g., the Sony Digital Paper System15 and 3-D printers. In the manner of
the “analog clock” option on your Macintosh, digital technology will emulate analog readouts when doing so offers cognitive
advantages. Consumer research will reveal the best configurations of analog and digital features. High tech will have to
remain high touch.


Consumers gain power, vis a vis corporations, via online reviews and “data activism” (Milan, 2016). Instances of customer
abuse are filmed on smartphones, and as United Airlines learned in April 2017, upon physically dragging a passenger from a
plane, they arouse backlash on Facebook, Twitter, and the blogosphere that in United's case initially cut the company's
capitalization by a billion U.S. dollars (Udland, 2017).

13.2. Logistics


Expect continued growth in the packing and shipping industries serving e-commerce. Increased product returns gives rise
to “reverse logistics” (Srivastava, 2008). This is especially true in the clothing trade (Venkatesh, 2010). Standards for apparel
sizes and for color saturation on computer monitors and phone screens will reduce product returns and reverse-logistics
costs.


Forward logistics will transform utterly as 3-D printing decentralizes production.
A glut of used shipping materials gives rise to social initiatives like that described by Leswing (2016), in which Amazon


pays shipping for donated items consumers send to Goodwill in used Amazon boxes. Expect other social entrepreneurs to find
ways to deal with the environmental diseconomies of the digital society.16 Peer pressure, peer competition, and gamification
seem to encourage charitable and volunteer behavior, such as the cooperative SETI project and the Einstein@home project, in
which users donate spare computer cycles to search for gravitational waves in data from the Laser Interferometer Gravita-
tional Wave Observatory, LIGO.17

13.3. Industry restructuring


Mergers and acquisitions will be weapons in the battles for control of media content and control of Internet registration
and transmission lines. Platform wars will continue.


The unexpected killer app for PCs was the spreadsheet program, and the unexpected killer app for the World Wide Web
turned out to be search. Searching “blockchain killer app” reveals (see, in particular, Metz, 2016) the killer app for blockchain
technology may not be untraceable money (like Bitcoin). At first, it is likely to be something illegal, like money laundering.
Upon maturity (remember, it was not until 2007 that search and social networking overtook pornography as the most-used
WWW capability), blockchain's killer app may be cryptocurrency, or insurance, banking, or legal contracts. So it will be with
other digital technologies: It will be some time before their biggest markets are identified. This merits careful monitoring.


Fainmesser and Galeotti (2016) introduce the idea of price discrimination based on a customer's network influence. Their
thesis seems to depend on information asymmetry (adverse selection), something that is harder and harder for vendors to
come by.

13.4. Four scenarios for the future of business in the knowledge society


The value drivers for scenario-building seem to be robots displacing human workers, the “digital feudalism” that directs
app-generated data and commissions to a small number of platform providers, and what an economic transaction implies
about “ownership.” Steve Denning comments in Forbes,


Nicholas Colin, Associate Professor in business strategy, Universit�e Paris-Dauphine, envisaged two broad scenarios. One is
a downward spiral in which customers will get ever-cheaper products and services, but there will be fewer well-paid
employees in their role as customers to purchase them.
A second scenario, more positive but perhaps less plausible, is that customers and employees might form an alliance in
which employees would provide more value to customers, through a rebirth of the union movement, and possibly a
stronger role played by social entrepreneurs.


A third possibility is to redefine innovation as an advance that does not attempt to grab rents by owning all information
thrown off by a search or a transaction, or by hoarding intellectual propertydand encourage innovative activity that adheres
to this definition.


Auken (2016) offers another positive scenario based on an extreme sharing economy: “Welcome to 2030. I own nothing,
have no privacy, and life has never been better.”
