The focus of this paper is on the relation between smart technologies and corporate sustainability.
Specifically, the purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the mediating role of corporate
sustainability strategy between smart technologies and corporate sustainability. By building on a survey
of 280 SMEs, the results show that corporate sustainability strategy fully mediates the relation between
smart technologies and environmental sustainability, and smart technologies and social sustainability.
Moreover, smart technologies have a direct significant influence on economic sustainability, but the
relationship is also partly mediated by corporate sustainability strategy. Smart technologies do not have a
direct influence on environmental or social sustainability.

1. Introduction


Smart technologies increasingly derive utility from the functional
relations they maintain, and potential benefits are indicated by the
growing prospects of combining software and software parts and
mixing content across infrastructures, production systems, and
platforms [1–7]. Manufacturing is going smart, and firms are
progressively utilizing wireless technologies and sensors to seize
data at multiple phases of a product's lifecycle [8]. Smart
technologies that make physical products addressable, programma-
ble, communicable, sensible, traceable, memorable, and associable
authorize novel incorporations of physical and digital proportions to
generate fresh products and manufacturing [3,4]. As a continuation
of rapid development of smart technologies, there is a need to
examine the implications they have generated [9,10].


Regarding the development of technology, especially smart
technology, manystudies emphasizethatthe implicationsneed to be
investigated through the aspects related to environmental, social,
and economical dimensions ([11,12]; Becthsis et al., 2018). However,
in profit-oriented organizations, the social and environmental
dimensions may be considered subsets of corporate competitive
strategy [13]. As a solution, a growing number of studies suggest
that companies should have corporate sustainability strategies,


which intend at stabilizing the economic, social, and environmental
needs of both the society and company to achieve corporate
sustainability performance [14–16]. This means that corporate
sustainability strategy compounds environmental and social
dimensions into the process of strategic management [13]. However,
there is lack of research considering the role of corporate
sustainability strategy in the relation between smart technologies
and corporate sustainability.


Based on the notions above, this study has the ambition to
empirically examine the effect of the utilization of smart technolo-
gies on the three dimensions of corporate sustainability: environ-
mental, social, and economical sustainability. The paper also aims to
study the mediating role of corporate sustainability strategy
between smart technologies and corporate sustainability. In other
words, it is essential to study whether the corporate sustainability
strategycanfacilitate the impactsof smarttechnologieson corporate
sustainability. The study builds on the analysis of 280 responses from
a random survey of Finnish SMEs. The results show that corporate
sustainability strategy completely mediates the relation between
smart technologies and environmental sustainability, and smart
technologies and social sustainability. Moreover, smart technologies
have adirectsignificant influenceoneconomic sustainability, but the
relationship is also partly mediated by corporate sustainability
strategy. Smart technologies do not have a direct influence on
environmental or social sustainability.


The remnant of this article is organized like this: First, the
current understanding of smart technologies, corporate sustain-
ability strategy, and corporate sustainability has been explored,

and the conceptual framework for the study established. Then, the
hypotheses are discussed, followed by a section on the research
methodology and results. Finally, the theoretical and managerial
implications of the study and avenues for further studies are
proposed.


2. Conceptual framework


2.1. Smart technologies


Today, smart technologies pervade each firm’s operations and
change the nature of the business. For instance, firms try to provide
intelligent management systems by embedding smart technologies
in machines [17]. Products and services equipped with smart
technologies offer novel functions that convert their designing,
manufacture, delivery, and use [4]. Additionally, smart technologies
provide huge potential for building new processes, experiences,
organizational forms, and relationships in which radio-frequency
identification (RFID) tags, digital sensors, networks, and processors
create required properties related to smart technologies [17].


Yoo [3] has used the term “digitalized artifacts” to describe the
necessary and desirable properties of artifacts to be digitalized. He
defined seven features of digitalized artifacts, including address-
ability, programmability, communicability, sensibility, traceability,
associability, and memorizability. Programmability is the first
characteristic of digitalized artifacts, meaning that the devices
should have the capability to accept new reconfigurations orchanges
of their functions. The second characteristic is addressability, which
refers to the devices’ ability to answer messages individually. The
next characteristic is sensibility, which enables devices to track and
react to changes in the surroundings. Communicability is another
characteristic, defined as the devices’ ability to send and receive
messages with other devices. Memorizability is the next character-
istic, defined as the devices’ ability to both record and store the
information that created, sensed, or communicated. Traceability is
another characteristic that enables devices to chronologically
recognize, memorize, and integrate incidents and totalities over
time. The final characteristic is associability that provides the
capacity for devices to be recognized with other totalities, such as
other artifacts, places, and people. Kallinikos et al., [6] use the term
“digital artifacts,” and state that interactivity, editability, distributed-
ness, and reprogrammability/openness are among the four aspects
of digital artifacts. Editability refers to continuous updating of the
content, items, and data, while interactivity means enabling
exploitation of information using the receptive and flexible nature
of the objects embedded in digital artifacts. They defined reprog-
rammability/openness as the ability of the digital artifacts to be
accessible and modifiable, while distributedness refers to the
borderless capability of digital objects.


In another study, Yoo et al. [4] refer to reprogrammability, data
homogenization, and self-referential as the fundamental proper-
ties of smart technologies. Reprogrammability means that new
functions or abilities can be added to the devices after they are
designed or produced, while data homogenization refers to
different types of digital contents (e.g., text, audio, image, and
video) being stocked up, dispatched, refined, and displayed
utilizing the identic digital networks and devices. Self-referential
refers to the necessity of utilizing smart technology in offerings.
Further, Yoo et al. [4] referred “the incorporation of digital
capabilities into objects that had a purely physical materiality
beforehand” as the main characteristics of pervasive digital
technology. They also explained physical materiality as the
tangible artifacts that are usually hard to move in terms of time
and place limitations.


As discussed before, similar ideas have developed with different
terminology [3,4,6,17]. Thus, in this study, smart technologies refer


to the bundle of properties embedded into previously nondigital
devices and enabling smartness for those devices.


2.2. Corporate sustainability


From the corporate perspective, sustainability research often
adopts a systems perspective that concentrates on business-driven
operations in natural systems [18]. It is widely accepted that firms,
albeit, business-driven schemes, are coevolving with sundry
schemes (involving the society and environment) [19]. This
necessities investing in economic factors, but also in environmental
and social aspects [20–24]. For example, Elkington’s [25] triple
bottom line approach considers the prolonged prosperity of a firm to
be dependent on paying attention to three aspects of sustainability:
social (social surroundings), environmental (natural surroundings),
and economic. Environmental sustainability is based on the
presumption that people live within the physical and biological
boundaries that attend on the source of life and waste disposal [26–
28]. Social sustainability adverts to accompanying social capital for
example by means of participating to local communities [26]. This
requires balancing human needs with economic and environmental
wellbeing [29,30]. Economic sustainability concentrates on the
financial value of things, including the costs of environmental effects
[26]. Triple bottom line is the most prominent framework to
understand the facets of sustainable development and that is why it
was selected as a basis of this study. The three dimensions of triple
bottom line were considered as the most essential from the
perspective of corporate sustainability performance. Lozano [31]
has proposed an extension to the triple bottom line by incorporating
the dynamics of the three dimensions over time. This temporal
dimension highlights the tension among environmental, social, and
economic troubles, but also over long and short-term perspectives.
We use the term “corporate sustainability” to describe the idea that,
to inducesustainability inthe longrun,firmsneedtoprocessall three
dimensionsthattheyarecoevolvingwith:environmental, social,and
economic [20,22].


2.3. Corporate sustainability strategy


Ranged sustainability and business strategies mirror the
amplitude and nature of the possibilities affiliated with sustainable
development as regards to the recreation of value for the company
[32]. Baumgartner and Rauter [13] present that the prime
justification for selecting a sustainability stance is to decrease
the negative social and environmental effects of company
operations, while enhancing the economical performance of the
organization. Corporate sustainability strategies can be considered
as strategies that point towards “balancing the social, environ-
mental and economic needs of both the company and society”
[14,15,33]. Baumgartner and Rauter [13] suggest that a corporate
sustainability strategy connects environmental and social aspects
into the process of strategic management and emphasizes the
strategic standing of a corporation in terms of sustainable
development. The unification of social and environmental factors
into company mid-time and long-time visions claims that a
prudent stability is reached between the requirements of external
and internal stakeholders [13]. Building on the above, this study
defines corporate sustainability strategy as the integration of
sustainable development principles into business operations.


3. Hypotheses development


Our hypotheses are built on the following argumentation.
Smart technologies reduce the need for resources (human,
material, etc.) and increase the expectation for efficiency, so they
are hypothesized to be a driving force for corporate sustainability


M. Saunila et al. / Computers in Industry 108 (2019) 178–185 179






strategy and corporate sustainability. Corporate sustainability is
examined through social, environmental and economic sustain-
ability. The hypotheses’ development is defined and discussed next
(Fig. 1).


3.1. Smart technologies and environmental sustainability


Smart technologies, such as information and communication
technologies, and digitalized production machines have been
considered to have potential positive impacts to the environment,
for example, by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (e.g.,
[34,35]). In addition to the reduction of GHGs, smart technologies
currently provide possibilities for intelligent and automated
solutions and production optimization among different industries,
such as manufacturing, power generation, and agriculture, thus
improving energy efficiency. For example, different kinds of digital
twins can produce real-time data and automatically adjust and
optimize processes. Iacovidou et al. [36] present that RFID
technologies can be used to support and increase the reutilization
of building components and decrease their waste, thus supporting
environmental sustainability achievements within the building
sector. Smart technologies can also be used to support the
achievement of sustainable development and environmental
protection goals by supporting information flow throughout
production processes. For example, Tao et al. [37] conclude that
if data are gained in real time, manufacturing processes can be
effectively controlled, and this may decrease the energy expendi-
ture in public premises, production devices, and workpieces.


As such, smart technologies can be considered enablers that can
reduce the energy consumption and emissions of industrial
processes, electrical grids, and transportation systems [38].
Different studies have reported that smart technologies, such as
digitalized manufacturing technologies and automatized working
machines, can be an important part of the solution in dealing with
current environmental challenges and issues related to climate
change [38,39]. Thus, based on the evidence from previous
research, the following hypothesis is presented:


H1. Smart technologies are positively related to environmental
sustainability.


3.2. Smart technologies and social sustainability


It is suggested that the growing prospects of combining
software and software parts and mixing content across infra-
structures, production systems, and platforms increasingly derive
utility from the functional relations they maintain [1–4,6]. Social
sustainability is one of the most important perspectives when
considering the benefits and impacts of these smart technologies
[11,40]. Chen et al. [11] studied the incorporation of production
technology and product modeling that straightly transforms digital
patterns to physical affairs without the demand for tooling,


suggesting social sustainability outcomes such as: equivalent
opportunities to all parties in societies and markets, user-oriented
goods and services, enhanced customer value, possible advantages
for worker/human health, and influence on an industry’s working
situation. Further, Bechtsis et al. [40] studied intelligent, self-
governing vehicles in digital supply chains, suggesting that,
considering the social sustainability, employee accessibility and
safety, together with safety and health of the conveyors, is
dominant. Furthermore, they highlighted the ongoing recreation of
proficient jobs, the sustained enhancement of ergonomics for the
workforce, the recognition of possibilities for sensors’ applicability
to upgrade work safety, and the enactment of objects for tracking
and estimating possible dangers.


Summarizing this, smart technologies seem to have implica-
tions for social sustainability in terms of increasing safety [40] and
employment [11]. Thus, the evidence from prior studies supports
the formation of the following hypothesis:


H2. Smart technologies are positively related to social sustain-
ability.


3.3. Smart technologies and economic sustainability


Bekaroo et al. [34] present that, so far, scholars have shown that
main drivers for sustainability using smart technologies usually
include an economic expectation to improve efficiency. Issues
related to climate change and growing environmental worries are
changing the form of operations and organizations in the energy
sector [41]. Further, the power-saving features of current smart
technologies can help reduce cooling burdens by decreasing the
quantity of heat produced to deliver a more effective economic
benefit [34]. Technological development and new types of smart
technologies can offer inferior cost structures and opportunities
for reaching the goals of different sustainability aspects (Costa-
Campi, 2018). In addition to the possibilities of economic
sustainability in the energy sector, current and emerging smart
technologies also provide possibilities for economic sustainability
among many other industries. Automated and digitalized energy-
efficient smart technologies and different resource-saving tech-
nologies and processes can reduce costs and, thus, improve the
productivity of organizations among different industries [42].
Smart technologies assist in optimizing production processes and
the entire life cycle of products. Thus, smart technologies provide
greater benefits for the state of the workforce, the site and
organization of lots, and the state of manufacturing machinery
[43]. Further, self-organizing production, predictive and coopera-
tive maintenance, efficient transport planning, as well as accurate
classification of retirement and disposal decisions, can increase
economic returns from smart technologies [37,43].


Based on the above, by digitalizing traditional manufacturing
environments, smart technologies can be used to increase
productivity, speed, quality, and the safety of operations aiming
to increase economic sustainability (e.g., [44]). Thus, based on the
evidence from previous research, the following hypothesis is
presented:


H3. Smart technologies are positively related to economic
sustainability.


3.4. Corporate sustainability strategy as a mediator


Demands for cleaner production have increased because of
issues related to environmental, social, and economic sustainabili-
ty. Referring to Caputo et al. [45], to achieve sustainability, research
on both structural and dynamic dimensions must be conducted.
The structural dimensions refer to the existence of resources and

180 M. Saunila et al. / Computers in Industry 108 (2019) 178–185






feasible strategic pathways, while the second dimension is the way
of managing those resources and the pathway according to
sustainable strategy. In their research, they also refer to the being
of a solid relationship between sustainability and smartness. They
mentioned that, to clarify the presence of this relationship, there is
a need for the precise definition of emerging and evolving this
relationship over time. Despite the fact that cleaner production
strategy provides huge potential for environmental, social, and
economic benefits, many difficulties and barriers (e.g., absence of
sufficient awareness about cleaner technologies, shortage of
enough tools and information, and weak communication schemes)
[46,47] need to be overcome.


As one of the main characteristics of smart technologies is being
present at any time, they are always threatened by certain risks,
such as being lost, hardware crash, or other accident. Consequently,
sustainability of smart technology can be mentioned as one of the
ideal approaches to reducing the number of the above-mentioned
risks [48]. Additionally, the way that knowledge is collected,
distributed, and exploited with technologies can be considered as
the most important issues in achieving sustainability [39].
According to Stuermer et al. [48], full exploitation of sustainability
needs sustainability of smart technologies. Thus, smart technolo-
gies can be considered the means to sustainability.


Based on Caputo et al. [45], smart technologies support the
definition by clarifying more efficient, effective, and sustainable
pathways. Besides, they address the interlinkage between smartness
and sustainability, leading to new insights. Thus, in light of
sustainability science, the effective approach toward smartness will
be achieved based on building a collaborative approach among the
actors involved. Similarly, Maher et al. [49] refer to the way digital
tools can helptackle sustainability issues by making progress inways
of thinking, communicating, and collaborating. In their research,
they refer to the need for a synergy map to develop sustainability. In
this synergy map, they refer to finding the linkage between key
issues of sustainability, identifying devices to tackle these issues, the
relationship between these devices, and they underline the potential
foradding digitalartifacts tothese devices. Inthisregard, Romanelli’s
[50] reference to building sustainable value using technology
depends heavily on cooperation and collaboration within the
ecosystem and named governments, businesses, and communities
as the key actors and enablers of value. Furthermore, he refers to the
impact of utilizing technology in knowledge creation to sustain
development in the long term. Thus, constituting a corporate
sustainability strategy that integrates sustainability with business
operations plays an important role between smart technologies and
the achievement of sustainability.


To sum up, smart technologies can be considered the bundle of
properties that are embedded into previously nondigital devices
and enable smartness for those devices. To provide benefits from
smart technologies, there is a need for corporate sustainability
strategy, which will fuel corporate sustainability in three
dimensions (environmental, social, economic). Therefore, smart
technologies enable corporate sustainability strategy, which fuels
corporate sustainability in all three dimensions (social, environ-
mental, and economic) (cf. [51]). Therefore, based on the beyond-
mentioned evidence, the last hypotheses formed is as follows:


H4. Corporate sustainability strategy mediates the positive
relation between smart technologiesand corporate sustainability.


H4a. Corporate sustainability strategy mediates the positive
relation between smart technologies and environmental
sustainability.


H4b. Corporate sustainability strategy mediates the positive
relation between smart technologies and social sustainability.


H4c. Corporate sustainability strategy mediates the positive
relation between smart technologies and economic sustain-
ability.


4. Methodology


4.1. Sample and data collection


The sample of the research includes Finnish firms with 20–250
employees. According to the database, the population comprised
approximately 20,000 firms. A population of 6816 firms was
randomly selected. Among the 6816 SMEs, 986 had invalid contact
information; thus, the survey was conducted with 5830 firms.
Therefore, the sample represents approximately 30% of the entire
population of Finnish firms that met the criteria. The decision of
working with a sample of firms with more than 20 employees is
based on the idea that microfirms usually do not have the
opportunity to concentrate on sustainability, as they have fewer
financial resources and knowledge.


To collect data, a structured questionnaire was created, and a
direct link was sent to the respondents by e-mail. The question-
naire was aimed at the top managers of the firms, as they have a
general vision of the topics of this study. In the end, 280 valid
questionnaires were obtained. Approximately 70% of the responses
came from small companies, and approximately 30% came from
medium-size companies. Further, 81.8% of the companies were
established more than 15 years ago. About 57.1% of the respondents
were from service-oriented firms, whereas 42.1% were from
manufacturing firms.


Non-response bias was assessed by testing for differences
between early respondents and late respondents on study items
(independent, mediation, and dependent variables). Early respond-
ents responded within a reasonable period after receiving the first e-
mail. Late respondents were those who responded after several
reminders. Late respondents most precisely reminded non-respond-
ents (Armstrong and Overton, 1977). Both tests on the means of the
constructs, as well as on the means of each of the items, revealed no
statistically significant differences (at significance level 5%). Thereby,
non-response bias did not cause any problems.


Several practices were used to diminish a common method bias
(Podsakoff et al., 2003). First, every questionnaire item was
informed by previous studies, and scales were informed by expert
views to decrease item obscurity. Second, a letter of invitation
ensured confidentiality to decrease social desirability bias. In
addition, Harman’s single factor test was used to explore for
common method bias (Podsakoff et al., 2003). The exploratory
factor analysis of all items displayed more than single factor with
eigenvalues higher than 1.0, proposing that common method bias
does not exist.


4.2. Measures


This study utilized a managerial assessment of the utilization of
smart technologies, as well as the state of sustainability strategy,
and corporate sustainability in the respondents’ firms. Thus, the
respondents provided evaluations of the constructs in their firms.
The response to the question required adequate knowledge
concerning their firm’s operations. Managers were selected as
respondents because they were expected to have this knowledge.
The items measuring theoretical constructs were informed by
literature review, but where existing items were not identified, the
researchers relied on the extant literature to specify the content of
each construct. Since the target firms are SMEs, the items were
selected based on relevance in the SME context. Detailed
description of measurement items are presented in the Appendix.

Smart technologies. This independent variable is a multidi-
mensional construct, and we used a six-item measure that has
been previously used (in [3]) to assess smart technologies. The
respondents were requested to express the degree to which they
agreed with the consequent statements: “In our company, all the
devices are programmable,” “In our company, all the devices are
able to be uniquely identified,” “In our company, all the devices are
aware of the respond to changes in their environment,” “In our
company, all the devices can send and receive messages,” “In our
company, all the devices can record and store all information,” and
“In our company, all the devices can be identified with other
devices, places, or people.” The respondents were asked to choose
a number from 1 to 7 (from (1) strongly disagree to (7) strongly
agree). Cronbach’s alpha of the construct is 0.945, which exceeded
the recommended threshold of 0.7 [52].


Sustainability strategy. The mediating variable, sustainability
strategy, was measured by the following: “what is your company!s
ability to integrate sustainable development principles into
business operations over the last three years”. The respondents
were asked to choose a number from 1 to 4 (1=weak,
2=satisfactory, 3=good, 4=excellent).


Corporate sustainability. Three widely accepted dimensions
measured the dependent variable: environmental sustainability,
social sustainability, and economic sustainability. The respondents
were asked to assess the following over the last three years:
environmental sustainability, social sustainability, and economic
sustainability. The items were as follows: “what is the state of your
company!s environmental sustainability (ability to take into
account and reduce the environmental impact of the activity)
over the last three years”, “what is the state of your company!s
social sustainability (ability to promote health, safety, and well-
being) over the last three years”, and “what is the state of your
company!s economic sustainability (ability to ensure the long-term
economic balance of the company) over the last three years”. The
respondents were asked to choose a number from 1 to 4 (1=weak,
2=satisfactory, 3=good, 4=excellent).


Single-item measures have started to suffer puzzles with their
validity and reliability (Sarstedt and Wilczynski, 2009; Diamanto-
poulos et al., 2012). However, they are acceptable with some
limitations: if the empirical setting contains concrete singular objects
(Bergkvist and Rossiter, 2007, 2009), if the objects are homogenous
(Loo, 2002), and if the objects are unequivocal to the respondent
(Sackett and Larson, 1990). These terms are met in this study.


The control variables—company size, age, and industry—were
included, as they are considered the determinants of sustainability.
Company size was estimated as the amount of employees in the
company. Company age was computed as the amount of years
since its foundation. Industry was controlled by using a dummy
variable according to the value of “100 if the firm operated in a
manufacturing sector.


5. Results


The validity and reliability of the variables were investigated
past to hypothesis testing, and this examination was presented in


the methodology section. Table 1 presents the correlations for the
smart technologies, sustainability strategy, and corporate sustain-
ability. The Table 1 demonstrates significant correlations along
with the variables throughout. These results express a relationship
between the study variables. To test the possibility of multi-
collinearity, the variance inflation factors were computed. They
were below the cutoff value of 10 and, therefore, multicollinearity
did not cause problems.


Table 2 shows the results of the regression analysis for the
relationship between smart technologies and corporate sustain-
ability. The significance of the F-value determines whether the
model in question supports the hypothesis. Moreover, the
coefficient of determination, noted as R2, measures the power of
the regression model. According to Hair et al. [52], there is
interplay between the sample size and number of independent
variables in detecting a significant minimum value of R2. Based on
the sample size (N = 280) and number of independent variables
(IV = 1) in this study, the R2 values of 3% and greater have been
detected. Model 1 includes the effect of smart technologies on the
environmental dimension of corporate sustainability. The model is
significant, but only industry explains the variance in environ-
mental sustainability. Thus, environmental sustainability is
considered better in service-oriented firms than in manufactur-
ing-oriented firms. Model 2 includes the effect of smart technolo-
gies on the social dimension of corporate sustainability. Model 2 is
not significant. Model 3 is significant, and the results indicate a
positive relation between the smart technologies and economic
dimension of corporate sustainability. The results show that smart
technologies positively and significantly influence only one
dimension of corporate sustainability, economic sustainability,
supporting Hypothesis H3. However, contrary to our expectations,
no significant results were found regarding the link between smart
technologies and two dimensions of corporate sustainability:
environmental and social. Thus, our findings provide no support
for H1 or H2. Finally, model 4 includes the effect of smart
technologies on the mediating variable, sustainability strategy. As
Table 2 shows, model 4 is significant, and smart technologies
explain the variance in sustainability strategy. The model also
shows that firm age is positively related to sustainability strategy.
To sum up, the results from the analyses show that smart
technologies are directly connected with the economic dimension
of corporate sustainability, but not the environmental and social
dimensions of corporate sustainability.


Hypothesis 4 proposed that corporate sustainability strategy
mediates the relationship between smart technologies and
corporate sustainability. This mediation was tested by using the
Baron and Kenny (1986) procedure. This procedure includes three
steps. First, a regression analysis between the independent
variable and dependent variables is conducted. Second, the effect
of independent variable on the mediator is determined. These
analyses are presented in Table 2 when testing for H1-H3. Finally, a
regression analysis is conducted with all the variables, and these
results are presented in Table 3. Based on Zhao et al. (2010), the
model has full mediation if there is a significant mediated effect
but no significant direct connection between the independent

variable and dependent variables. If there is a direct connection
between the independent variable and dependent variables but
also a significant mediated effect, the mediation is partial.


Following this procedure, it was observed that smart
technologies are not related to environmental sustainability
(model 1) and social sustainability (model 2) but are related to
economic sustainability (model 3). Second, the effect of smart
technologies on sustainability strategy was examined. The
results indicate that this relationship is positive and significant
(model 4). Finally, the joint effects were examined. The
coefficients show that the inclusion of the sustainability
strategy variable in model 5 makes the relationship between
smart technologies and environmental sustainability non-
significant and the relationship between sustainability strategy
and environmental sustainability significant. Therefore, sus-
tainability strategy plays a full mediator role in the relationship


between smart technologies and environmental sustainability,
thus supporting H4a. The same procedure was followed to
evaluate H4b-4c. The coefficients show that the inclusion of the
sustainability strategy variable in model 6 makes the relation-
ship between smart technologies and social sustainability non-
significant and the relationship between sustainability strategy
and social sustainability significant. Therefore, sustainability
strategy plays a full mediator role in the relationship between
smart technologies and social sustainability, thus supporting
H4b. The results also show that, when including sustainability
strategy and smart technologies together in model 7, the effect
of smart technologies on economic sustainability continues to
be significant, but sustainability strategy is also significant. This
indicates partial support for H4c.


To sum up, the results suggest that corporate sustainability
strategy fully mediates the relationship between smart

environmental sustainability and social sustainability. In the case
of economic sustainability, the mediation effect is partial.
Summary of hypotheses testing is presented in Table 4.


6. Discussion and conclusions


6.1. Theoretical implications


The purpose of this study was to explore the mediating role of
corporate sustainability strategy between smart technologies and
corporate sustainability. Smart technologies have been suggested
to play a crucial role in the sustainable development of firms (e.g.,
[36,37,43]). Our findings add to the evidence supporting sustain-
ability strategy as an important factor in smart technologies
research. The main contributions to theory are as follows.


First, the study contributes to the literature on smart
technologies [3,4,6,8,17] and their role as a driver of corporate
sustainability [37,40]. As predicted, smart technologies had a
direct effect on economic sustainability. Thus, the study
supports the views of previous research indicating that smart
technologies can reduce costs ([42]; Costa-Campi, 2018) and
increase economic returns by using self-organizing production,
assisting predictive and cooperative maintenance, intensifying
transport planning, as well as classifying retirement and
disposal decisions accurately [37,43]. This finding suggests that
the smart technologies have a crucial role to play in attaining
economic sustainability.


Contrary to previous research (cf. [10,11,36]), the study did not
find support for the direct linkage between smart technologies and
environmental and social sustainability. Previous research has
indicated that smart technologies may contribute to environmen-
tal and social sustainability, for example, by decreasing energy
consumption [37], and improving the safety and employment
situation [11,40]. Our results show that the environmental and
social returns from smart technologies are not self-evident, and
smart technologies alone are not sufficient to generate environ-
mental and social sustainability.


Second, the study adds to the evidence regarding the role of
sustainability strategy in obtaining corporate sustainability
[14,15,33,45,49]. Our results also indicate that corporate sustain-
ability strategy fully mediates the effect of smart technologies on
environmental sustainability. This suggests that smart technolo-
gies act on corporate sustainability by encouraging a firm to
integrate sustainable development principles into business oper-
ations. In turn, corporate sustainability strategy enables the firm to
increase its environmental sustainability. Similarly, the results
show that the effect of smart technologies on social sustainability
was fully mediated by corporate sustainability strategy. The finding
suggests that implementing smart technologies increases the
integration of sustainable development principles into business
operations which, as above, drives increased social sustainability.
Our results support the results of Caputo et al. [45] who highlight
the managing corporate resources and pathway according to
sustainable strategy.


6.2. Managerial implications


We entrust that this study offers novel insights for firms looking
for to enhance the utilization of smart technologies in increasing
corporate sustainability. The implications of these findings for
managerial practice are as follows. Smart technologies can
generate financial returns, but they alone are not sufficient to
generate environmental and social sustainability. Instead, the
influence of smart technologies on corporate sustainability is
influenced by the extent of the integration of sustainable
development principles into business operations. Implementing
smart technologies is not in itself sufficient; rather, it is the process
of integrating sustainable development principles into daily
business operations that creates the returns of smart technologies
in terms of corporate sustainability. Firms often prefer to
implement smart technologies without integrating them into
sustainable development goals. Evidence from this study suggests
that smart technologies serve to improve corporate sustainability
primarily because they stimulate the integration of sustainable
development principles into business operations. Thus, managers
need to recognize the importance of this strategy for integrating
the use of smart technologies and firm-level sustainable develop-
ment and ensure that the resources required to support such
activities are adequate and available.


6.3. Limitations and further research directions


First, this study is cross-sectional, which limits the ability to
study issues that evolve over time. Thus, our findings may be
validated with additional longitudinal research. Second, geograph-
ical area of the research should be taken into account when
generalizing the results. The data is also based on the self-reports
of managers within the firms and, therefore, potentially subject to
biases. A better assessment of the relationships between smart
technologies, corporate sustainability strategy, and corporate
sustainability outcomes could be gathered if additional perspec-
tives were sought. Finally, there may be other contingency factors
that affect the relationships in the model. Due to practical
restrictions, the number of control variables in the survey was
limited. Future research could take closer look into the context that
smart technologies generate corporate sustainability.
