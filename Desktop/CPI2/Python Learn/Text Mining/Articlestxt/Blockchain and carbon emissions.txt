This paper examined the drivers of blockchain technology adoption and carbon performance using the theory of 
technology-organization-environment (TOE) as the basis for the development of a technology adoption frame-
work. Blockchain technology has passed the proof testing phase and is attracting early adopters who can gain 
benefits from it. Manufacturing firms that had adopted the blockchain technology and voluntary reported the 
carbon emission were targeted as the sample and survey data were collected from manufacturing firms that were 
registered with the Association of Malaysian Manufacturers. Unfavourable support of top management and the 
lack of technology competence were the main barriers to the adoption of blockchain technology among 
manufacturing firms. The results indicate that firms did not achieve low carbon performance and that a lack of 
pressure from competitors and technical competency to undertake blockchain technology were factors. No ev-
idence existed demonstrating a linkage of early adopters of blockchain technology with and low carbon per-
formance. Recommendations of this study include that firms should take the initiative to record the energy 
consumption, engage in the transfer of carbon credits, and monitor carbon performance using reliable technology 
to improve business transparency and sustainability.   


1. Introduction 


In the last four decades, Southeast Asia countries have transformed 
rapidly from agriculturally based nation to countries in which industry 
leads the economy. In Malaysia, without exception, the industrial sector 
has become a leading enabler of economic grown. Political stability, 
safety, proximity to vendors and consumers, among other reasons, have 
attracted global manufacturing firms to run their operations in Malaysia. 
Global manufacturing plants have established in the country and have 
begun to ramp up high-end technology to leverage their competitive-
ness, and cyber-physical production systems utilized in Industrial Rev-
olution 4.0 have become critical for firms to gain a competitive 
advantage [1]. In this process, the Malaysian government has aided in 
attracting investors, taking responsibility for creating pro-active indus-
trial regulations, clean energy incentives, digitalization of production 
and distribution. Additionally, pressure for cleaner production, trans-
parency, accountability, automation, and lower cost production have to 


the promotion of blockchain technology in industry. Blockchain tech-
nology can be used to improve visibility, transparency and the accurate 
computation of the country’s carbon footprint [2]. Blockchain technol-
ogy has a high level of security and cannot be hacked. It can be used to 
support the integration of energy production, utilization, transmission, 
and storage [3] so that every carbon footprint activity and carbon 
trading transaction can be tracked and no data can be manipulated. 


The supply chain of manufacturing firms is among the primary 
contributors to carbon emissions [4]. From a manufacturing perspective, 
energy consumption, logistics and waste are among the contributory 
factors of carbon emissions as is the transportation of finished goods [5]. 
Concern with low carbon performance drove the government to pro-
mote lower greenhouse gas emissions, with carbon dioxide (CO2) 
serving as mitigation yardstick. To service this end, Malaysia had 
announced the intention to voluntarily reduce carbon emissions up to 
40% by 2020 [6]. Unfortunately, Malaysia had increased projection CO2 
emissions by about 68.9% in 2020 compared to emissions produced in

2000 [7]. Because emissions target and date could not be met, the target 
date was revised, with the government pushing to reduce greenhouse 
gases by 45% by 2030 [8]. Despite these good intentions, the likelihood 
of actually achieving the newly articulated emissions target and target 
date remains difficult if no initiation is taking to understand the per-
formance measurements of carbon emissions. However, successfully 
monitoring and measuring carbon remains difficult. 


As mentioned, this paper aims to investigate the drivers of block-
chain technology adoption and carbon performance among early 
adopters. The behavioural perspective on the energy consumption will 
lead to better understanding of how effective the blockchain technology 
was adopted to enhance the industrial awareness of the sustainability 
issues. 


The rapid industrialisation of the nation’s economy has led to rapidly 
escalating energy consumption and an unprecedented rise in greenhouse 
gas emissions. In this context, CO2 is classified as a greenhouse gas and is 
a by-product of the consumption of non-renewable fossil fuels like coal, 
petroleum and natural gas [4,9]. As the level of greenhouse gases has 
risen, climate change has become a central concern around the globe 
due to rising sea levels, sea surface temperature, the melting of Arctic 
sea ice and presence of extreme weather. However, manufacturing 
firms’ actions towards climate adaptation have often been sorely 
underwhelming. Although various guidelines and policies exist for car-
bon emission reductions, the deliberations on the adaptation of strate-
gies remain inadequate. According to Al Amin et al. [10], most 
developing countries have been left behind environmentally sustainable 
thresholds and, hence, have not succeeded in developing and following 
sustainable development strategies effectively, which include carbon 
reduction and the use of renewable sources of energy. 


Manufacturing firms are facing pressure from stakeholders to submit 
carbon footprint reports in Malaysia. In December 2013, the Ministry of 
Natural Resources and Environment in Malaysia introduced the National 
Carbon Reporting Program (MyCarbon) to encourage Malaysian firms to 
report their carbon footprint voluntarily. Unfortunately, the initiative 
was fruitless. Industry provided little support from industry and data 
reported by the firms have the potential for manipulation or data loss. 
However, with the application of blockchain technology, fraud can be 
avoided due to the fidelity and transparency of blockchain technology. 


Blockchain technology is currently receiving interest for a wide va-
riety of industries [11] and has been proven to be a useful concept to 
improve the transparency and integrity data. Although industry has 
accepted blockchain technology, a need exists for further development 
to achieve the desired operational and target performance [12]. 
Malaysia has been looking to use blockchain technology in its predom-
inant industries, especially in renewable energy and the palm oil and 
agricultural sectors. For example, the Malaysian electricity agency has 
taken a significant interest in blockchain technology because they 
believe that technology will encourage the faster adoption of renewable 
energy. The goal is the certification of palm oil sustainable supply chains 
using blockchain and distributed ledger technologies. 


This paper differs from others based in terms of its contributions. The 
first contribution lies in its uniqueness. This paper is one of the early 
studies investigating the impact of blockchain technology adoption on 
achieving better carbon performance using TOE as underpinning theory. 
As little information available in literature on how the blockchain 
technology has been adopted in the industry. The question on what the 
main drivers of blockchain technology to achieve the better carbon 
performance remains unidentified. 


The TOE is utilized to predict the drivers of blockchain technology 
adoption and among the expected outcomes of this paper is assisting 
scholars in understanding the critical drivers of blockchain technology 
and a way to move forward for improvement. The second contribution is 
the emphasis on how this new technology can be adopted successfully. 
The drivers would be insights for the best practices. Currently, block-
chain technology has moved past the concept-testing stage and the 
process of deployment. The insight from early adopters can extend the 


proof concept of digitalization of manufacturing process and distribu-
tion. The outline of this paper is as follows. Section 2 briefly describes 
the adoption of blockchain technology and builds a theoretical frame-
work using a review of the relevant literature. Section 3 discusses 
methods of measurement, data collection and sampling. Section 4 pre-
sents the results of the analysis, and a discussion of the findings is pre-
sented in Section 5. The paper ends with limitations and suggestions and 
for future studies. 


2. Literature review 


2.1. Blockchain technology 


Blockchain technology can be defined as a distributed ledger that is 
cryptographically secure and immutable, in which changing the dada is 
extremely hard [13]. Blockchain enables each of the transactions 
without requiring the involvement of third parties. According to Lau-
rence [14], in the blockchain system, each transaction made is recorded 
onto a ledger and then put into the block. Each block is connected with a 
block before and after it. Once a block is connected within a chain, it 
becomes immutable, and a single actor cannot alter or delete the blocks. 
Blockchain is a decentralization network that enables suppliers and 
demanders to make point-to-point transactions. All enterprise nodes will 
follow the same protocol. 


According to Wang et al. [15], two types of blockchains exists, which 
are based on access control mechanisms. The first type is a public 
blockchain. This type of blockchain can make transactions without 
permission and is anonymous. A public network has an incentivizing 
mechanism to encourage more participants to join the network. The 
second type is a private blockchain. A member who wants to the join 
network needs to be invited or have system approval. Usually, a single 
organization (private blockchain) and a consortium of members’ 
monitor access. 


Bottlenecks, a shortage of talent, standardisation and supervision 
mechanisms and reliability and security issues are among the challenges 
of blockchain adoption [16]. If a firm can adopt blockchain technology, 
then they gain several benefits. The first benefit is disintermediation. In 
peer-peer networks, blockchains reduce reliance on third parties. Sec-
ond, security is increased because the information and data that have 
been distributed are hard to hack. This is because the information 
recorded in the database is permanent and uses computational algo-
rithms. Third, the blockchain provides transparency. Participants in a 
blockchain are unable to alter information, which reduces the possibility 
of avoiding fraud and dishonesty [15]. Thus, according to Janssen et al. 
[17], blockchain technology has been heralded as the next revolution of 
an effective business transaction. 


2.2. Blockchain-enabled technology for carbon trading 


As emissions have become a primary concern, manufacturing firms 
have received increasing pressure to limit the amount of greenhouse gas 
(GHG) of total production. Khaqqi et al. [18] postulated that blockchain 
technology could be used as a platform for emissions trading. An 
emissions trading scheme (ETS) is known as tradable permits policy. In 
this context, an equal number of GHS permits are distributed to firms. At 
the end of a defined period, participants are required to issue a report on 
the amount of emissions produced. Then, participants can trade their 
GHG permits. A firm that has produced less GHG than permitted can sell 
their excess capacity to others who have produced more emissions than 
permitted. 


An ETS can assist manufacturing firms in achieving carbon emissions 
reduction. The transparency and fidelity of emission trading process 
using blockchain technology can improve efficiency, transparency and 
fidelity [19]. Carbon trading using blockchain technology can ensure 
the safety of each transaction. All transactions will be faithfully recorded 
in a shared ledger, and a timestamp record will ensure that each

transaction can be traced back. Blockchain technology can record and 
transmit information flow in carbon emission trading to avoid lost 
quotas or repeated transactions. Any unauthorised trading activity will 
be detected. All carbon emission transactions must comply with the 
same consensus algorithm to make all processes consistent [20]. 


2.3. The energy consumption and blockchain related environmental 
impacts 


The blockchain technology drives the efficiency in the control and 
manage the energy consumptions. The mining algorithms need to be 
utilized to cluster the pattern of energy consumption and sustainability. 
The support of AI and virtual energy management systems are able to 
indicate the optimal placement of heat recovery in a distributed ledger 
of blockchain technology [21]. Besides, the Internet of Things can be 
installed to support the blockchain and monitor the energy consumption 
in real time. It will assist the authorized personnel to access the trans-
parent and reliable data of energy consumption. The energy consump-
tion data recorded from Blockchain can be visualized. It can be 
identified which energy are produced from renewable and nonrenew-
able resources [22]. Yet, it is timely to discuss the sustainability issues in 
the application of blockchain technology from behavioral and socio-
economic perspectives [21]. From a technical point of view, Parnell [23] 
posit that the scholar should able to solve the grid stability to monitor 
the energy usage in the blockchain systems. The bitcoin can track and 
visualize unsustainability of the energy consumption with algorithm. 
Despite that the Bitcoin as the platform of the blockchain technology can 
work effectively and monitor the electricity consumption [24], it has 
been argued that Bitcoin gains doubt due to its scalability and sustain-
ability of the technology [25]. The success adoption of blockchain 
technology can reduce the negative impact on environmental outcomes 
such as fossil fuel combustion. In nutshell, blockchain technology can 
promote the development of renewable energy and meets the aim of 
global carbon reduction [26]. 


2.4. Technology, organizational and environmental model 


TOE framework is used to explain the adoption of blockchain tech-
nology. Tornatzky and Fleischer [27] developed the TOE, which pro-
vides an integrative framework for the adoption of emerging 
technology. TOE categorised three distinguish contexts. First is the 
technological context. It addresses the variables of the technologies that 
influence decisions about blockchain technology adoption, like tech-
nical competence and compatibility. Second is the organizational 
context. This context describes the variables of an organization that 
influence blockchain technology adoption, such as firm size and top 
management support. The third, and last domain, is the environmental 
context. This context explains the variables related elements that sur-
round an organization, such as competitive pressure. 


There are other variables available in the literature on theory 
adoption model, and most of the theory adoption models were relevant 
to individual users and not applicable to the corporate perspective (e.g. 
Technology Acceptance Model, Theory of Reasoned Action, Unified 
Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, etc.). From corporate 
perspective, TOE has guided the scholars to identify the drivers of 
technology adoption. The domains of TOE are extended from time to 
time to ensure the relevancy of the theory to timely business context. In 
this paper, we have adopted the TOE drivers to predict the technological 
adoption. 


2.5. Carbon performance 


CO2 is the most abundant greenhouse gas that human activities 
produce. Because carbon emissions are the largest greenhouse gas 
emissions, monitoring CO2 is critical as is consistently determining 
whether emission targets are met. According to IPCC [28], 


manufacturing is the second-largest contributor to carbon emissions at 
21% behind energy generation at 25%. Manufacturing firms should 
focus on reducing carbon emissions of products, using energy efficiency 
and reducing the usage of carbon-intensive materials to lower carbon 
emissions [29]. Low-carbon performance can be monitored using a 
composite indicator. This indicator is an analytical tool to summarize 
complex and multi-dimensional low-carbon performance [30]. Gov-
ernments can educate firms to practice clean production and provide 
incentives to lower their carbon footprints. 


3. Hypothesis development 


The three factors that are considered the drivers of blockchain 
technology adoption are the technological context, organizational 
context, and the environmental context. These drivers have been 
conceptualized to predict blockchain technology adoption among 
manufacturing firms. The adoption of blockchain technology can assist a 
firm in achieving low-carbon performance. Fig. 1 shows the research 
model. 


3.1. Technological-organizational-environmental and blockchain 
technology adoption 


The technological context refers to the technologies relevant to a 
firm. This includes technology competence and compatibility. Techno-
logical competence indicates the preparation of a firm in infrastructure, 
as well as the level of knowledge relating to such technology, and a 
firm’s willingness to become involved in the familiarization of such an 
activity [31]. The firms with sufficient resources are more competent to 
adopt blockchain technology because they are better prepared than 
incompetent ones (H1). 


Compatibility is an essential factor in explaining innovation usage by 
organizations and is the extent to which innovation is seen to be 
consistent with the needs of an organization. High compatibility has 
been identified as a facilitator for innovation implementation (H2). 
Therefore, compatibility may be a critical determinant of blockchain 
technology adoption [32]. 


The organizational context describes the characteristics of an orga-
nization. Common organizational characteristics include firm size, 
readiness, and top management support. Firm size can influence the 
adoption of blockchain technology. For example, large firms have more 
resources than small firms [33]. If not ready for the adoption of a new 
technology, a firm potentially faces risks associated with compatibility. 
It has been argued that the large scale firms are faster than small firms 
for new technology adoption due to availability of resources (H3). 


Top management support plays a vital role in the adoption because 
blockchain adoption involves new regulatory requirements, the

acquisition of new resources, a high degree of complexity, information 
exchanges, the integration of resources, competencies and the devel-
opment of new skills [34–36]. Top management has designed strategic 
business plans and is responsible for business performance. They have 
an important role to suggest the appropriateness of technology adoption 
to improve overall business performance (H4). 


The environmental context is the industry in which a firm conducts 
its business and the perceived competitive pressure in the industry. 
Competitive pressure refers to the pressure from competitors that a firm 
feels to adopt new technology and has been found to be an essential 
driver for technology diffusion. From lens of industrial behavioural 
perspective, the companies are willing to adopt new technology when 
their competitors are already used it. They are aware that technology 
can help them be more economical to establish a competitive edge (H5). 


The adoption of new technology is often a strategic necessity to 
compete in the marketplace [33]. By adopting blockchain technology, 
firms can have better market visibility and more accurate access to 
real-time data. These propositions can be morphed into the following 
hypotheses: 


H1. Technology competence will have a significant and positive rela-
tionship to the adoption of blockchain technology. 


H2. Compatibility will have a significant and positive relationship to 
the adoption of blockchain technology. 


H3. Firm size will have a significant and positive relationship to the 
adoption of blockchain technology. 


H4. Top management support will have a significant and positive 
relationship to the adoption of blockchain technology. 


H5. Competitive pressure will have a significant and positive rela-
tionship to the adoption of blockchain technology. 


3.2. Technological-organizational-environmental and carbon 
performance 


According to Ritter and Gemunden [37], technology competence 
enables an organization to use, understand and exploit technology 
internally. Also, technical competence supports the preparation of 
technology infrastructure, including the adoption of a basic level of 
knowledge as it relates to the available technology. Firms which are 
competence on the technological adoption will be able to perform better 
on the carbon outcomes (H6). 


In terms of compatibility, rather than manually record data for car-
bon emissions, the implementation of blockchain technology can help in 
reducing fraud, manipulation and data loss. We argued that the 
compatible technology adopted by firms on energy consumption will 
lead to low carbon performance (H7). 


The size of the firm is associated with the firm’s total assets, which 
reflects a firm’s resources. Higher sustainability value can be found in 
larger firms, and such firms tend to deliver more environmental metrics 
in their annual reports [38]. On the other hand, without government 
support, small-sized firms are mostly challenged by insufficient budgets 
for complying with energy-related regulations. Since the blockchain 
technology has lead to the carbon monitor and reduction, the govern-
ment has invested initial capital for technology adoption. The large and 
small size companies have equal opportunities to achieve low carbon 
performance (H8). 


Top management support is a determining factor in organizations, 
which controls all processes, including decision making and strategic 
planning [39]. The firms will run their business well if the top man-
agement supports the adoption of emerging technology to achieve low 
carbon reduction (H9). 


Lastly, firms are increasingly subject to competitive pressure to 
reduce GHG emissions in a country that is committed to reducing carbon 
emissions. Pressure for low carbon performance can be achieved if the 


company has observed that competitors have better carbon performance 
than them (H10). These statements can be morphed into the following 
hypotheses: 


H6. Technology competence will have a significant and positive rela-
tionship with carbon performance. 


H7. Compatibility will have a significant and positive relationship 
with carbon performance. 


H8. Firm size will have a significant and positive relationship with 
carbon performance. 


H9. Top management support will have a significant and positive 
relationship with carbon performance. 


H10. Competitive pressure will have a significant and positive rela-
tionship with carbon performance. 


3.3. Blockchain technology adoption and carbon performance 


A lack of enforcement on environmental compliance can no longer be 
ignored [40]. Firms need to invest in the technology to comply with 
environmental regulations and assume responsibility for reducing car-
bon emissions, and blockchain technology is a reliable platform to re-
cord and transmit information flow in carbon emissions trading. 
According to Pan et al. [20], blockchain technology can be deployed to 
record corporate carbon transactions. Firms can visualize carbon emis-
sion activities and record carbon performance. The consumption status 
will be checked at specified intervals, and the output of carbon emissions 
reduction will be stored in the database. Thus, the adoption of block-
chain technology can help a firm to avoid fraudulent transaction records 
with a timestamp and a unique cryptographic signature. The trans-
parency and integrity of GHG can assist a firm to achieve low carbon 
performance. 


H11. Blockchain technology adoption has a significant and positively 
related to carbon performance 


4. Methods 


An electronic survey collected data from a sample of manufacturing 
firms listed in the FMM 2019 directory (n =±3194 firms). A few filtered 
questions were utilized as sample inclusiveness criteria and avoid the 
selective bias issues such as 1) to ensure whether the company has 
adopted the technology under investigation; 2) to ensure whether the 
company has been actively monitoring energy consumption for last 
three consecutive years; 3) to ensure that carbon performance has been 
reported and discussed in the annual general meeting. If these three 
criteria are met, the company is asked to participate in the survey 
voluntarily. 


This study addressed the e-survey to managing directors, IT man-
agers, energy managers and production managers to target the appro-
priate decision-makers in a firm. Of the 500 questionnaires sent using 
stratified sampling, a total of 103 were returned, representing a response 
rate of 20.6%. Data retrieved from e-survey were analysed using IBM 
SPSS Version 23 (descriptive) and the structural equation modelling 
with PLS-SEM Software 3.2.8 for model and hypothesis testing. The PLS- 
SEM was utilized to ensure the data quality that meets the statistical 
requirements. PLS-SEM achieves the objective of study to investigate the 
relationship variance between independent variable and dependent 
variable. Convergent and discriminant validity tests were utilized to 
ensure the goodness of the model exist in the model and a bootstrapping 
procedure for hypothesis testing. 


After the data were collected, the first step was to examine the 
completeness of the data, code and label the data and sorting error en-
tries such as missing or incorrect values and recoding some relevant 
variables. The variables were measured using a questionnaire that 
contained 29 construct items. Each measurement item was measured

using a 5-point Likert scale to help respondents express their level of 
agreement or disagreement with each statement. Likert scale values 
ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The instrument 
items were adapted from the previous studies (See appendix). 


5. Results 


5.1. Profile of Manufacturing’s firm 


The descriptive analysis was conducted to identify the profile of the 
respondents. Table 1 shows that no significant disparities were identi-
fied between early (1-week after initial invitation) and late (follow up 
after 1-week) survey responses. The late response participants are proxy 
of the non-response ones. The non-respond bias test was established. 
Thus, no evidence was found for response bias (p > 0.05). 


Table 2 shows the profiles of the firms. Questions such as firm size, 
ownership and frequency of monitoring carbon emissions were asked to 
know the background of the firm. Most firms had more than 200 em-
ployees with (48.5%), followed by 75–200 employees at (38.8%) and of 
5–75 employees (12.6%). Furthermore, the ownership most of the 
participating firms were Malaysian owned (31.1%), followed by joint 
venture at 27.2%, American-based firm at 21.4%, followed by Asian and 
Europe at 10.7% and 9.7% respectively. Finally, the frequency of firms 
monitors carbon emission were quarterly at 49.5%, monthly at 21.4%, 
semi-annually at 19.4% and annually at 9.7%. This study only selected 
firms that had adopted blockchain technology to understand how this 
technology was relevant to lowering carbon emissions. Table 2 shows 
that manufacturing firms that had initiated adopted blockchain tech-
nology less than 10% (80.6%) of deployment (early adopters). Most 
participating firms provided training for blockchain technology to em-
ployees (63.1%), while only 36.9% did not provide training for 
employees. 


5.2. Common method bias 


Common method bias can occur when the respondents falsely answer 
questions. Bias could happen because one person represents a firm. 
Because the possibility existed that common bias could occur in the 
model, a collinearity test was performed to ensure all analysed data were 
free any of method biases. VIF is generated for all latent variables in a 
model. According to Hair et al. [41], the VIF value should be lower than 
5 to be an acceptable score. All VIF scores were lower than 5, ranging 
from 1.660 (lowest) to 3.403 (highest), which indicates that they are 
free from common method bias. 


5.3. Model measurement 


5.3.1. Convergent validity and reliability 
Convergent validity can be measured using outer loadings of each 


construct, average variance extracted (AVE) and composite reliability 
(CR). The accepted value for outer loadings should be greater than 0.5 to 
meet the reliability and validity criteria [41]. Based on Table 3, all 
reflective items were retained and had an acceptable value (>0.5). 
Second, convergent validity is acceptable when the average variance 
extracted (AVE) exceeds 0.5 [42]. Table 3 shows that all AVE values 
were more than 0.5, which indicates that measurement constructs 
explained half or more of variance in indicator variables. The values 
ranged from 0.688 to 0.927. Cronbach’s alpha can be used as a tradi-
tional criterion for internal consistency. It provides an estimate of the 
reliability based on the inter-correlations of the observed indicator 
variables. CR is used as a suggested replacement of the traditional cri-
terion because CR gives a more accurate estimation. Hair et al. [41] 
suggested that value for CR should be 0.7 and above. Table 3 shows that 
the CR values for all constructs were higher than the benchmark of 0.70.

5.4. Discriminant validity 


Discriminant validity can be assessed through Fornell and Larcker 
criterion, cross-loading and HTMT ratio to ensure that construct items 
are dissimilar from other construct items. According to Hair et al. [43], 
the square root of AVE of a latent variable should be greater than the 
correlations between the latent variable and all other variables. Table 4 
shows that the Fornell and Lacker criterion indicates that the square root 
of each variable was higher compared to other below constructs value. 
The cross-loadings can be established to perform a discriminant validity. 
Table 5 shows each of the loadings of an item assigned on its latent 
variable was higher than the loadings on other latent variables. How-
ever, Fornell-Larcker criterion as cross-loadings assessment was unable 
to capture discriminant validity criteria. Thus, an additional validity test 
using the Heterotrait-Monotrait (HTMT) criteria was required. Accord-
ing to Gold et al. [44], value for HTMT should be below 0.9 for reflective 
indicators. Table 6 shows that all HTMT values were below 0.9, and the 
highest of HTMT statistics was 0.849, which is lower than the threshold 
value of 0.850. 


5.5. Hypothesis testing 


R-square (R2) is the coefficient of determination and quantifies the 
explanatory power of predictors on the criterion. According to Hair et al. 
[41], the rule of thumb for the categories is: R2 is 0.25 for weak, 0.50 is 
for moderate, and 0.75 is for substantial. The calculated R2 value of TOE 
drivers was 0.651, meaning that 65.1% of low carbon performance 
variance could be attributed to TOE and blockchain technology adop-
tion. Meanwhile the R2 of blockchain technology adoption was 0.661, 
suggesting that 66.1% of blockchain technology adoption could be 
explained by TOE theory. 


Table 7 shows the results of hypothesis testing. The corresponding t- 
values were used to show the significance of the relationship between 
the constructs, and a 5% significance level (p < 0.05; t-value > 1.645) 
used as the basis of acceptance decision criterion. Seven of the eleven 
hypotheses were accepted, and four hypotheses were rejected. H1 
examined whether technology competence had a positive and signifi-
cant relationship with blockchain technology adoption. Technology 
competence had no significant relationship with blockchain technology 
adoption because the t-value was 0.162, which was less than 1.645 and 
coefficient value = −0.018, so hypothesis H1 was rejected. 


H2 examined whether compatibility had a positive and significant 
relationship with blockchain technology adoption. A significant and 
positive relationship existed between competitive pressure with block-
chain technology adoption (t-value = 3.072, coefficient value = 0.366), 
so H2 was accepted. H3 examined whether firm size had a positive and 
significant relationship with blockchain technology adoption. The re-
sults found that this relationship was statistically supported because the 
t-value was 2.157, which was more than 1.645 at a 5% significant level 
and coefficient = 0.274, so H3 was accepted. H4 examined whether top 
management support had a positive and significant relationship with 
blockchain technology adoption. The results found no relationship 


because the t-value was 0.650, and H4 was rejected. Hypothesis H5 
examined whether competitive pressure had a positive and significant 
relationship with blockchain technology adoption. The results found 
that the relationship was statistically supported because the t-value was 
3.025 and coefficient was 0.325, so H5 was accepted. 


H6 examined whether technology competence had a positive and 
significant relationship with low carbon performance. A significant and 
positive relationship existed between technology competence with low 
carbon performance (t-value = 2.009, coefficient value = 0.171), H6 
was accepted. H7 examined whether competitive pressure had a positive 
and significant relationship with low carbon performance. The results 
found that this relationship was statistically supported because the t- 
value was 2.778 and coefficient value = 0.322, H7 was accepted. H8 
examined whether firm size had a positive and significant relationship 
with low carbon performance. The results found that the relationship 
was significant, with a t-value of 2.185 and a coefficient value = 0.213. 
H8 was accepted. 


H9 examined whether top management support had a positive and 
significant relationship with low carbon performance. The results found 
that the relationship was statistically supported. The t-value was 6.215 
and coefficient was 0.564; thus, H9 was accepted. H10 examined the 
relationship between competitive pressure and low carbon performance; 
the t-value of the path was 0.162 and coefficient value = 0.015, so H10 
was rejected. H11 examined whether blockchain technology adoption 
had a positive and significant relationship with low carbon performance. 
Because the t-value 0.880 and coefficient value = −0.092, H11 was 
rejected. 


5.6. Importance-Performance Map analysis 


According to Ringle and Sarstedt [45], Importance-Performance Map 
(IPMA) can be applied to study the performance level between manifest 
variables and latent variables. Besides, IPMA provides information on 
the importance of variables to targeted construct. IPMA can be used to 
give more effort to the low latent variable that is required further to 
managerial actions. It can be used to analyse the indicator level to 
identify critical activities for the improvement of the dependent

variable. Table 8 shows that low carbon performance and technology 
competence were among the lowest constructs. This is indicated that 
firms were still challenged in achieving low carbon performance and 
lacked technical competency. Firms are continuously digitalizing supply 
chain networks using blockchain technology to remain competitive. In 
fact, blockchain technology adoption was the highest construct in the 
model. (Fig. 2). 


IPMA was established to identify which manifest variables have good 
performance and are of importance to the targeted construct. The results 
of IPMA for BTA shown in Table 9 indicate that item CP4 had the highest 
performance with (66.505) and a high importance level with (0.110) to 
the blockchain technology adoption while item T3 had the lowest per-
formance (53.155) with low importance level (−0.004). The values of 
importance level ranged from −0.015 to 0.111 while values of perfor-
mance range from 53.155 to 66.505. Table 10 shows the results of IPMA 
for LCP, which indicate that item BTA3 had the highest performance 
with (68.204) but had the low importance level with (−0.028) to the low 
carbon performance while item FS3 had the lowest performance 
(53.155) with a high importance level (0.065). 


6. Conclusion and policy implications 


To understand the drivers of new technology adoption among 
manufacturing firms for blockchain technology and carbon perfor-
mance, this study proposed TOE theory to support the theoretical 
framework. The aim was to understand how the effective usage of 
emerging technology to avoid the loss or manipulation of carbon 
emission data and progression of a way forward on the Industrial Rev-
olution 4.0 movement in Malaysia. The current record of footprint data 
was unable to track carbon trading and reporting correctly. Conven-
tional reporting with human intervention will be replaced by blockchain 
technology to monitor the performance of GHG emission at the firm 
level. The digitalization efforts will support the current certification 
programme on emission reduction (CERs) and renewable energy (RECs). 
However, not all firms have initiated the adoption of blockchain or 
frequently monitor their carbon performance. 


Regarding technology adoption drivers, the findings are consistent 
with the Oliveira et al. [33] that highlighted that the compatibility of 
technology, firm size and competitive pressure were among the critical 
drivers of adoption. Large-sized firms with enough resources will have 
the opportunity to recruit more skilful, experienced and knowledgeable 
operation/IT/energy managers to support the adoption of new tech-
nology. Also, firms can outsource vendors to develop blockchain tech-
nology to record their carbon emission activities and cater necessary 
training to the employees. 


This study found that competitive pressure had a direct link with the 
adoption of blockchain technology, which supports the findings of Missi 
et al. [46]. The higher the competitive pressure from competitors, the 
more likely a firm is to adopt blockchain technology to improve its 
competitiveness. A firm is more likely to seek ways of achieving sus-
tainable competitive advantage through effective and innovative tech-
nologies, which, in turn, will distinguish them in the industry. However, 
the absence of top management support and technology competence can

be barriers to the adoption of blockchain technology, which is consistent 
with the findings of Wang et al. [26]. Blockchain technology was mostly 
introduced by start-up firms that offer their service to the clients. Un-
fortunately, these early adopters are often not competent to manage the 
new technology to control low carbon performance. Besides, top man-
agement is still not giving much support for the adoption and national 
regulations for reporting carbon emissions (MyCarbon). It is still based 
on voluntary efforts. If top management does not give full support for 
adoption, the rest of the effort will remain merely an intention. Top 
management should not only invest in t infrastructure but also in 
establishing technical knowhow of blockchain technology itself for a 
smooth-sailing operation. 


The results indicate that drivers like technology compatibility and 
competence, firm size, and top management support were significantly 
and positively related to low carbon performance. However, a direct 
positive link from blockchain adoption to low carbon performance 
remained insignificant. A firm has an obligation to study carefully the 
supporting factors of blockchain adoption to improve carbon perfor-
mance. Firms must find environmentally friendly technology to balance 
the demands of sustainability and fulfilling consumers’ desires and 
green requirements [47]. Based on the findings of this study, the 
blockchain is still not the primary choice and ideal platform yet to record 
the transactions of purchasing carbon credits, carbon emission savings, 
monetizing carbon credits and carbon performance report until the 
enforcement to comply carbon emission activities with credible, 
accountable and transparent, and auditable technological platform. 


Since 2013, Malaysia has started to promote carbon emissions 
reporting and initiated a voluntary pilot carbon disclosure programme 
for industry. Because a good response has not been achieved from in-
dustry for reporting carbon performance, the time is ripe to examine the 
implementation of these programme at the corporate level. Although 
firms have mentioned carbon emissions in their annual report or annual 
sustainability and corporate responsibility reports, the actual data of 
carbon emission remains challenging to capture. In the current stage, the 
government agency is still exploring the potential drivers and incentive 
to attract more companies to adopt blockchain technology and involved 
actively in the transformation of renewable energy. The finding from the 
early study to test the proof of concept is needed. It can be utilized as the 
basis to design a policy to enhance the development of the industry and 
society’s well-being. In the future, the government needs to enforce the 
company to declare the transparency on how the energy was generated 
and spent. The blockchain technology can be a good platform for carbon 
trading on the excess the electricity generated from their solar farms and 
its distribution. 


Out of 72 countries have reported the finding of blockchain tech-
nology, China has lead the global movement of blockchain technology 
and its impact on the energy research followed by the United States, the 
United Kingdom, Italy and India [26]. However, the findings remain 
without consensus on what drives the company the most to adopt the 
blockchain technology. It is because most of the studies have reported 
the findings from experimental analysis and country perceptive. Lack of 
sociodemographic and corporate perspective domains were tested to 
draw a conclusion on blockchain technology adoption and its impact to

This study limited itself to the perception of respondents of carbon 
performance. Future study should use actual carbon performance data 
because actual data will provide a better understanding of a firm’s 
achievements. It will assist top management in designing strategic

planning, which with emissions reduction activities. The future study is 
also needed to explore the technical attributes of blockchain technology 
to be used to monitor the corporate GHG emission performance. 
Although this model has been tested in Malaysia, the future study can 
extend and test it in different country settings and find the consensus on 
the drivers and outcomes. Different country settings might produce 
different results. It is interesting to observe how the impact of block-
chain technology has been adopted to reduce carbon footprint with 
different energy policy, incentive, socioeconomic factors and resources. 
In summary, future study could examine the impact of low carbon 
emission on financial performance. 


This study is based on the early adoption of blockchain technology 
among manufacturing firms in Malaysia. From an energy management 
perspective, blockchain adoption could be used to monitor GHG per-
formance, especially from the production and transportation activities. 
The blockchain technology adoption is still not well practised in moni-
toring carbon reduction. Firms will adopt the technology to monitor 
carbon emission activities if the government provides incentives. The 
drivers’ adoption of blockchain technology and low carbon performance 
were identified, but the connection between blockchain technology 


adoption and low carbon performance remain without evidence. This is 
because the blockchain adoption remains in its initial stage and firms are 
still learning about its features and the necessary investments. Industry 
needs more exposure to the technology that enables them to be ready for 
the Industrial Revolution 4.0. Technical know-how is another issue that 
needs to be solved. Firms need to understand the clean energy 
requirement technology to comply with environmental regulations and 
to remain sustainable over the long term.
