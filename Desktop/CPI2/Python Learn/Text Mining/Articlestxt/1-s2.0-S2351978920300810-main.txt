Abstract 


The paper presents an overview of “Logistics 4.0” term in chosen scientific databases in order to describe the potential of research 
connected to this phenomena. As many solutions and devices concerning Logistics 4.0 were found, the authors of this paper decided 
to develop a mathematical model which allows subjective (calling it the expert-oriented method) evaluation of solutions in terms 
of their level of innovativeness. The application of this model is based on actual solutions currently used in industry and logistics 
(both management logistics and logistics engineering), exactly 8 years after the existence of the Industry 4.0 concept in the 
consciousness of scientists and managers. The first section of the paper is connected to the introduction of main ideas and 
embedding the subject matter in the professional literature and scientific databases. In the second section, the authors defined a 
mathematical model in order to make an assessment of the innovativeness level for selected solutions connected to Logistics 4.0. 
In the third sections, authors focused on the assessment of selected solutions as such. And the fourth section consists of a particular 
conclusion.

1. Introduction 


Logistics 4.0 is relatively new concept straightforwardly connected to Industry 4.0 (Industry 4.0 is a term that 
describes the general overview of the future “smart factory”, so does the term of “smart logistics” as well; Industry 
4.0 implications in logistics are described in [1]). This relativity of novelties might be confirmed e.g. by the analysis 
of trends in Google Trends browser or analyses used based on documents collected in scientific databases such as Web 
of Science, Scopus, Science Direct, etc. 


Google Trends assure checking the interest in terms of region or interest in time for any keyword searching. 
Interest by region assures to estimate which locations was most popular for a particular keyword in a given period. 


Whereas, interest in terms of time estimates numbers that represent individual interests towards the highest point in 
the chart printed in the browser. A value of 100 indicates the highest popularity of a particular keyword. In order to 
check the worldwide potential in the aspect of Logistics 4.0, checking of interest by region was sufficient. It occurred 
that while introducing the keyword “Logistics 4.0” into Google Trends browser only one country was analyzed. It was 
Germany, the origin country of Industry 4.0 term (date of analysis: February 22nd, 2019; Fig. 1), even after the heading 
“Include regions with low number of search operations” has been marked. This does not mean that the subject matter 
of Logistics 4.0 is not being discussed in other countries than Germany, which is due to the fact that the browser has 
too little data at its disposal (as it is explained in the commentary on Google Trends, a value of 100 indicates the 
highest popularity of particular keyword, meanwhile a value of 0 indicates that there is not enough data for the given 
keyword – therefore, it is not reasonable to say that the data are unreliable, since it could happen that Internet users 
searched for data in other browsers than Google). At the same time, however, it is worth noting that the global approach 
to the topic of Logistics 4.0 is still very rarely used and it is worthwhile to address this subject matter.

https://trends.google.pl/trends/explore?q=Logistics%204.0, last accessed 2019/02/22. 


The analysis performed with the use of the Scopus scientific database (date of analysis: February 22nd, 2019) is also 
worth considering. When the keyword “Logistics 4.0” was introduced in relation to the search of three records at the

same time, i.e. title, abstract, keywords, the following results were obtained. Twenty three documents were found, e.g. 
five in 2018, three in 2017. In previous years, one or two articles were published each year, which are indexed in the 
database. As it can be expected, taking into account the ideological issues of Industry 4.0 and Logistics 4.0 focused 
on engineering and programming, these publications are foremost grouped in subject areas as: computer science and 
engineering. 


Meanwhile, Web of Science database was searched in all fields with the same keyword (“Logistics 4.0”) – date of 
analysis: February 22nd, 2019. Also in this case not too many records have been achieved. Only ten documents were 
found, e.g. two in 2019 up-to-date, five in 2018. 


The analysis performed with the use of the Google Scholar scientific database (date of analysis: February 22nd, 
2019) is worth considering as well. Two hundred seventy records were noted in that database, of which thirteen were 
published in 2019 and one hundred eleven in 2018.

The statistics given above and summarized in Table 1 prove that Logistics 4.0 is still worth researching and its 
research potential might become very high in the nearest future. 


Several aspects of Logistics 4.0 were described up-to-date. Authors defined maturity levels and models for Logistics 
4.0 [2, 3]. Another considered aspect was the role of lifelong learning and education of new specialists connected to 
subject matter [4] (which is highly important especially that “changes in the working environment in the operative 
field of Logistics 4.0 lead to completely new competence requirements regarding the operational employees”, [5]). 
Researchers emphasized also business models connected to Logistics 4.0 [6] and its challenges and opportunities [7]. 
Rarely, authors were focused on analysis of technical and engineering aspects of solutions connected to subject matter, 
especially in the context of their innovativeness (it does not mean that technical aspects of solutions are not debated 
in literature – these were described in e.g. [8,9]). Taking into account the fact about growth of IoT (Internet of Things) 
connected devices installed base worldwide (Fig 2.), highly more significant increase of interest in Logistics 4.0 is 
expected among entrepreneurs and scientists. In order to clarify, it must be underlined that IoT is strongly connected 
to idea of Industry 4.0 and Logistics 4.0 and what is more these ideas are connected to digitalization of processes what 
would not be assured without IoT technologies. Therefore, based on data given in Fig. 2, it is assumed that interest 
among entrepreneurs and scientists in Logistics 4.0 might arouse similarly to the subject matter of IoT in the same 
groups of specialists.  


In the paper, an innovativeness level is given under question. Therefore, this term should be defined adequately. 
Innovativeness level in opinion of scientists of engineering needs less qualitative assessment methods since they 
believe more into numbers and quantities than in qualitative assessments. Therefore, innovativeness level assessment 
should be quantified. Some authors defined the appropriate level of innovation in terms of efficiency. They specified 
the number of implementations in relation to all submissions initially considered as innovative ideas. For example, it 
can be referred to the results given by Toyota and Cognizant in the publication [10]. 


In this paper, first of all the mathematical model for innovativeness level assessment is defined and described and 
next chosen solutions of Logistics 4.0 are given under consideration and assessment with usage of the mentioned 
model. At the end of this paper, it is concluded and several ideas for potential research are presented.

2. Innovativeness level 


First of all, it should be mentioned that innovativeness level is understood here as ratio between two numbers. The 
first number is the quantity of solutions released after Hannover Fair of Industrial Technologies event, that are 
considered as innovative. Hannover Fair of Industrial Technologies event has taken place in 2011, according to [1,11]. 
The second number is the total number of post-trade fair solutions presented in this paper. The innovativeness level 
ratio is expressed as a percentage and is a subjective value determined as a result of the expert method application. 
Meanwhile, innovativeness is understood as tendency to innovate, or introduce something new or different, 
characterized by innovation, [12]. However, the authors stipulate that they do not analyse which solutions are really 
innovative and which are not. 


This section presents the proposal of the tool for assessing the innovativeness level of the discussed solutions in 
relation to Logistics 4.0 as a compound of Industry 4.0. The date of Hannover Fair of Industrial Technologies event 
is useful in the proposed equation (tool redefined after [13]). 


At first stage of assessment the following datasets should be given: 


• A – a set of numbers of presented and assessed solutions,  ,A,a,, 1=A , 
• S – a binary set explained by its elements,  1,0=S , where s = 0 if the solution in question existed before or during 


2011 and s = 1 if the solution in question existed after 2011, 
• P – a binary set that explains whether a chosen solution has been implemented,  1,0=P , p = 0 if the solution in 


question was not implemented before, during or after 2011, p = 1 if the solution in question was implemented 
before, during or after 2011. 


The Cartesian product shall then be appointed as in equation (1), the elements of which are transformed into the 
set I as it is given in equations (2) and (3).

As the next stage, the parameter i , specifying the number of solutions taking the value ( ) 1, =pa,si , should be 
computed – according to equation (4). This parameter quantifies solutions which determines the number of solutions 
that can be considered as potentially innovative.

3. Assessment of innovativeness level 


The mathematical model described in section 2 of the paper is applied for 24 solutions and results of its application 
are given in Table 2. In the first column of Table 2 names of solutions are given. These solutions are not described in 
detail (solutions No. 1-4, 6-13 are a matter of discussion in [13]). Authors give references only, whereby more 
information about each solution can be found. The presented solutions are only examples – there are plenty of other 
solutions which might be taken into consideration, however it was not a point to bullet them all in the paper. 


Based on information given in Table 2, it can be stated that more than 71% of presented devices/solutions were 
released after the Hannover Fair of Industrial Technologies which took place in 2011. This might mean that the idea 
of Industry 4.0 utmost significantly contributes to the innovation of products in the sphere of Logistics 4.0. It can be 
said that the innovativeness level of solutions suggested as belonging to Logistics 4.0 in the context of Industry 4.0 is 
about 71% ( ( )i card 0.71=A ), therefore it is satisfactory. Although, it should be noticed that some of these solutions 
were developed before the significant date of 2011. When digitalized and innovative technologies in the context of 
Logistics 4.0 are discussed, human factor should not be omitted. In aspects connected to Industry 4.0 and Logistics 
4.0, predispositions of employees are important one. As Oskar Verkamman mentioned in [55]: “(…) more than half 
of the current workers entered the workforce without mobile telephony and smartphones. Half of them even started 
without any computers at all. So, if we look back, it is amazing how easily and quickly we embraced all those new 
technologies, almost without any hesitation.” This is positive opinion about the changes that occur during several last 
years. This is also promising statement in the case of Industry 4.0 and Logistics 4.0. 


4. Conclusion 


The innovativeness level of solutions suggested as belonging to Logistics 4.0 is significant, as it was mentioned 
before. It is evident that the development of Industry 4.0 based on digitization and automation represents for Logistics 
4.0 not only huge challenges but also opportunities for increasing efficiency. It is also worth mentioning that the 
similarity of logistics and production processes blur the differences between Logistics 4.0 and Factory 4.0 and 
consequently also Industry 4.0. Solutions focused around Logistics 4.0 should be evaluated in terms of effectiveness 
and efficiency according to known and commonly used modeling methods, including in particular modeling with the 
use of simulation methods. It is also worth paying attention to forecasting these solutions which was not subject matter 
of this paper but might be worth mentioning as future research option. Logistics 4.0, as well as Industry 4.0, is setting 
high demands not only in technological, engineering or economic aspects but foremost on the education process, as 
smart factories (or any other smart facilities) and smart logistics need highly skilled employees and management 
personnel. One of main assumptions of Industry 4.0 is that not only specialists, but also operational workers will soon

perform mainly organizational and conceptual tasks. This is the reason of the necessity for adapting educational 
process to a new situation. The objective of future works is to present the analysis of the challenges for logistics 
education – this aim was taken in e.g. Universities of the Future project (https://universitiesofthefuture.eu, last 
accessed 2019/02/23).

The authors realise that relying only on date (Hannover Fair of Industrial Technologies event date) to determine 


the level of innovation is not a complete approach. This may be considered a necessary but not sufficient condition 
for determining the level of innovation. The actual innovativeness will be verified over time as a result of the analysis 
of the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed solutions. What is more, the authors are aware that many fragments 
of this paper are treated briefly. Nevertheless, it is a contribution to further work on these topics.
