Abstract: This paper aims at delineating major features of the two new perspectives in supply chain (SC) 


disruption risk management, i.e., ripple effect and resileanness. The methodologies to mitigate the SC dis-


ruptions and recover in case of severe disruptions are discussed. It observes the reasons and mitigation 


strategies for the ripple effect in the SC and presents the ripple effect control framework that is comprised 


of redundancy, flexibility, and resilience. Even though a variety of valuable insights has been developed in 


the given area in recent years, new research avenues and ripple effect taxonomies are identified for the 


near future. The special focus is directed towards the supply chain risk analytics for disruption risks and 


the ripple effect in digital supply chains. In particular, the digital SC twin framework is presented. Copy-

1. RIPPLE EFFECT 





Disruption risks represent a new challenge for supply chain 


(SC) managers when designing and managing resilient SCs 


(Ivanov and Arkhipov 2011, Klibi and Martel 2012, Spiegler 


et al. 2012, Ivanov et al. 2013, Mizgier et al. 2013, Ambulkar 


et al. 2015, Yildiz et al. 2016, Ivanov et al. 2014a,b, Fahim-


nia et al. 2015, Ho et al. 2015, Govindan et al. 2016, Schmitt 


et al. 2017, Sawik 2017, Rezapour et al. 2017, Ivanov 2018a, 


Dolgui et al. 2018, Ghavamifar  et al. 2018, He et al. 2018, 


Macdonald et al. 2018, Song et al. 2018). In many cases, we 


face the ripple effect when considering SC disruptions. The 


ripple effect occurs when a disruption, rather than remaining 


localized or being contained to one SC part, cascades down-


stream and impacts the performance of the SC (Ivanov et al. 


2014a,b, Han and Shin 2016, Sokolov et al. 2016, Akker-


mans, and van Wassenhove 2017, Dolgui et al. 2018, Ivanov 


2017a,b, 2018a,b, Levner and Ptuskin 2018, Oiha et al. 2018, 


Pavlov et al. 2018, Scheibe and Blackhurst 2018, Dubey et al. 


2019, Hosseini et al. 2019a,b, Ivanov et al. 2019a,b). This 


impact might include lower revenues, delivery delays, loss of 


market share and reputation, and stock return decreases— the 


cost of all of which could be devastating. 


Ripple effect causes structural changes in the SC. The main 


supply chain features is the multiple structure design and 


changeability of structural parameters because of objective 


and subjective factors at different stages of the SC life cycle. 


In other words, supply chain structural dynamics is constant-


ly encountered in practice (Ivanov and Sokolov 2010, Ivanov 


et al. 2010, 2017a,b,c, Ivanov 2018a, 2019a,b).  


One of the main objectives of SC disruption risk management 


is therefore and control structural dynamics to increase total 


SC performance. At the same time, achievement of planned 


performance can involve the impact of disruptions in a real-


time execution environment. SC execution is subject to un-


certainty at the planning stage and disruption at the execution 


stage. Cost efficiency comes with a huge hidden expense 


should a major disruption (i.e., a more severe impact than a 


routine disturbance) occur. This requires SC protection 


against and efficient reaction to disturbances and disruptions. 


Therefore, supply chains need to be planned to be stable, 


robust and resilient enough to (1) maintain their basic prop-


erties and ensure execution; and (2) be able to adapt their 


behavior in the case of disturbances in order to achieve 


planned performance using recovery actions. 


Resilient SC design extends traditional SC design approaches 


with regard to the incorporation of redundancies such as 


back-up facilities, inventory and capacity flexibility. These 


redundancies create, at the proactive planning stage, some 


flexibility that can be used at the reactive control stage in the 


case of disruptions in SC structures in order to recover sys-


tem performance and operational processes. 


There is a strong and growing literature on robustness and 


resilience as two fundamental concepts to analyze SC per-


formance with severe uncertainty consideration and with re-


gards to scattered disruptive events resulting in SC structural 


dynamics. A SC is called robust if it is able to absorb dis-


turbances and continue execution with minimal impact on 


performance. The performance of such a SC is insensitive to 


the negative impacts of disruptions (Ivanov and Sokolov 


2013, Cavalcentia et al. 2019, Hosseini et al. 2019a,b, Yoon 


et al. 2018, Lücker et al. 2019, Pavlov 2019, Ivanov and 


Sokolov 2019). At the same time, we may distinguish be-


tween being safe and performing safely. In contrast to robust-

Abstract: This paper aims at delineating major features of the two new perspectives in supply chain (SC) 


disruption risk management, i.e., ripple effect and resileanness. The methodologies to mitigate the SC dis-


ruptions and recover in case of severe disruptions are discussed. It observes the reasons and mitigation 


strategies for the ripple effect in the SC and presents the ripple effect control framework that is comprised 


of redundancy, flexibility, and resilience. Even though a variety of valuable insights has been developed in 


the given area in recent years, new research avenues and ripple effect taxonomies are identified for the 


near future. The special focus is directed towards the supply chain risk analytics for disruption risks and 


the ripple effect in digital supply chains. In particular, the digital SC twin framework is presented. Copy-

1. RIPPLE EFFECT 





Disruption risks represent a new challenge for supply chain 


(SC) managers when designing and managing resilient SCs 


(Ivanov and Arkhipov 2011, Klibi and Martel 2012, Spiegler 


et al. 2012, Ivanov et al. 2013, Mizgier et al. 2013, Ambulkar 


et al. 2015, Yildiz et al. 2016, Ivanov et al. 2014a,b, Fahim-


nia et al. 2015, Ho et al. 2015, Govindan et al. 2016, Schmitt 


et al. 2017, Sawik 2017, Rezapour et al. 2017, Ivanov 2018a, 


Dolgui et al. 2018, Ghavamifar  et al. 2018, He et al. 2018, 


Macdonald et al. 2018, Song et al. 2018). In many cases, we 


face the ripple effect when considering SC disruptions. The 


ripple effect occurs when a disruption, rather than remaining 


localized or being contained to one SC part, cascades down-


stream and impacts the performance of the SC (Ivanov et al. 


2014a,b, Han and Shin 2016, Sokolov et al. 2016, Akker-


mans, and van Wassenhove 2017, Dolgui et al. 2018, Ivanov 


2017a,b, 2018a,b, Levner and Ptuskin 2018, Oiha et al. 2018, 


Pavlov et al. 2018, Scheibe and Blackhurst 2018, Dubey et al. 


2019, Hosseini et al. 2019a,b, Ivanov et al. 2019a,b). This 


impact might include lower revenues, delivery delays, loss of 


market share and reputation, and stock return decreases— the 


cost of all of which could be devastating. 


Ripple effect causes structural changes in the SC. The main 


supply chain features is the multiple structure design and 


changeability of structural parameters because of objective 


and subjective factors at different stages of the SC life cycle. 


In other words, supply chain structural dynamics is constant-


ly encountered in practice (Ivanov and Sokolov 2010, Ivanov 


et al. 2010, 2017a,b,c, Ivanov 2018a, 2019a,b).  


One of the main objectives of SC disruption risk management 


is therefore and control structural dynamics to increase total 


SC performance. At the same time, achievement of planned 


performance can involve the impact of disruptions in a real-


time execution environment. SC execution is subject to un-


certainty at the planning stage and disruption at the execution 


stage. Cost efficiency comes with a huge hidden expense 


should a major disruption (i.e., a more severe impact than a 


routine disturbance) occur. This requires SC protection 


against and efficient reaction to disturbances and disruptions. 


Therefore, supply chains need to be planned to be stable, 


robust and resilient enough to (1) maintain their basic prop-


erties and ensure execution; and (2) be able to adapt their 


behavior in the case of disturbances in order to achieve 


planned performance using recovery actions. 


Resilient SC design extends traditional SC design approaches 


with regard to the incorporation of redundancies such as 


back-up facilities, inventory and capacity flexibility. These 


redundancies create, at the proactive planning stage, some 


flexibility that can be used at the reactive control stage in the 


case of disruptions in SC structures in order to recover sys-


tem performance and operational processes. 


There is a strong and growing literature on robustness and 


resilience as two fundamental concepts to analyze SC per-


formance with severe uncertainty consideration and with re-


gards to scattered disruptive events resulting in SC structural 


dynamics. A SC is called robust if it is able to absorb dis-


turbances and continue execution with minimal impact on 


performance. The performance of such a SC is insensitive to 


the negative impacts of disruptions (Ivanov and Sokolov 


2013, Cavalcentia et al. 2019, Hosseini et al. 2019a,b, Yoon 


et al. 2018, Lücker et al. 2019, Pavlov 2019, Ivanov and 


Sokolov 2019). At the same time, we may distinguish be-

1. RIPPLE EFFECT 





Disruption risks represent a new challenge for supply chain 


(SC) managers when designing and managing resilient SCs 


(Ivanov and Arkhipov 2011, Klibi and Martel 2012, Spiegler 


et al. 2012, Ivanov et al. 2013, Mizgier et al. 2013, Ambulkar 


et al. 2015, Yildiz et al. 2016, Ivanov et al. 2014a,b, Fahim-

Dolgui et al. 2018, Ghavamifar  et al. 2018, He et al. 2018, 


Macdonald et al. 2018, Song et al. 2018). In many cases, we 


face the ripple effect when considering SC disruptions. The 


ripple effect occurs when a disruption, rather than remaining 


localized or being contained to one SC part, cascades down-


stream and impacts the performance of the SC (Ivanov et al.

2017a,b, 2018a,b, Levner and Ptuskin 2018, Oiha et al. 2018, 


Pavlov et al. 2018, Scheibe and Blackhurst 2018, Dubey et al. 


2019, Hosseini et al. 2019a,b, Ivanov et al. 2019a,b). This 


impact might include lower revenues, delivery delays, loss of 


market share and reputation, and stock return decreases— the 


cost of all of which could be devastating. 


Ripple effect causes structural changes in the SC. The main 


supply chain features is the multiple structure design and 


changeability of structural parameters because of objective 


and subjective factors at different stages of the SC life cycle. 


In other words, supply chain structural dynamics is constant-


ly encountered in practice (Ivanov and Sokolov 2010, Ivanov

ness that considers proactive redundancy (e.g., buffer capaci-


ties, backup suppliers, or risk mitigation inventory) at the pre-


disruption stage, resilience deals with the system’s ability to 


sustain or restore its functionality and performance following 


a significant change in the system and environment condi-


tions (Tang 2006, Aven 2017). As such, an integration of 


pro- and reactive decisions is important for increasing SC 


resilience by utilizing the synergetic effects between mitiga-


tion and contingency policies.  


According to the ripple effect control framework (Dolgui et 


al. 2018) and other literature on the disruption propagation in 


the SC (e.g., Scheibe and Blackhurst 2018), disruption risks 


and their propagation in the SC are mainly caused by single 


sourcing, low risk mitigation inventory, overutilization of 


capacities, and missing contingency plans.  


The width of the ripple effect and how it impacts economic 


performance is reliant on redundancies such as inventory or 


capacity buffers, also called robustness reserves, and on the 


speed and extent of recovery measures. As a result, it is nec-


essary that, in the proactive mode, risk and SC resilience are 


assessed and incorporated at the design and planning stages. 


In the reactive mode, operationalization of contingency plans, 


such as alternative suppliers or shipping routes, must occur 


quickly in the control stage.  


Ripple effect control in the SC requires two critical capaci-


ties: resistance and recovery. For resistance, which is the 


SC’s ability to protect against disruptions and reduce impact 


once the disruption occurs, some redundancy such as backup 


sourcing, risk mitigation inventory or capacity flexibility 


must be built in at the proactive stage. For recovery, this re-


dundancy must be activated jointly with reactive contingency 


plans with regards to risk mitigation inventory, capacity flex-


ibility and backup sources. 


Robustness reserves can include material inventory, capaci-


ties buffers, etc. Increase in inventory, additional production 


capacities, and alternative transportation methods or back-up 


facilities would increase costs. At the same time, these so-


called redundant elements would potentially lead to an in-


crease in sales and service level. Redundancy elements may 


also increase supply chain flexibility and have positive ef-


fects on both service level and costs. The resilient state of a 


SC requires a balanced robustness and flexibility which al-


lows for achieving maximum performance with disruption 


risk considerations at acceptable redundancy costs.  


While ripple effect and disruption risks has attracted consid-


erable research attention, this research domain seems to be at 


the beginning stage of development. Some future research 


avenues are summarized in this section. With regards to the 


current research, we refer the readers to recent state-of-the-art 


survey in the given domain for more detailed analysis (Ho et 


al. 2015, Fahimnia et al. 2015, Ivanov et al. 2017c, Dolgui et 


al. 2018, Hosseini et al. 2019a). 


2. RISK ANALYTICS AND INDUSTRY 4.0 


Innovations in digital technologies influence the development 


of new paradigms, principles, and models in SCs. The Inter-


net of Things (IoT), cyber physical systems, additive manu-


facturing, and smart, connected products, facilitate the devel-


opment of Industry 4.0-driven digital SC (Ivanov et al. 2016, 


2019b). Such technology advances are facilitated by the ad-


vent of big data analytics, and advanced tracking and tracing 


technologies. Accompanying such technological advances are 


similar advances in organizational practice and culture, 


shaped by socio-technical considerations of new technology 


use. The dynamic nature of digitalization demands research 


that can help analyze, understand, and evaluate its drivers, 


facilitators, and performance outcomes, Such outcomes could 


range from time competitiveness to risk management and 


resilience.   


The impact of digitalization on resilient operations and the 


SC can be quite complex. Consider some interplays. Risk in 


the SC can be mitigated by the descriptive and predictive use 


of big data analytics in gaining visibility and forecast accura-


cy, reduction in information disruption risks, and improved 


contingency plan activation. Reductions in supply and time 


risks can be achieved by using advanced trace & tracking 


systems leading to real-time coordinated activation of contin-


gency policies.  


SCs typically hedge against disruptions by means of risk mit-


igation inventory, capacity reservations and backup sources. 


Such protection is expensive to maintain (in anticipation), 


and deploy. Block-chain digitalization could help reduce risk 


and associated preventive costs, if a record of activities and 


data needed for recovery exists for synchronized contingency 


plans. Similarly, additive manufacturing can reduce the need 


for risk mitigation inventory and capacity reservations, as 


well as diminish the need for expensive backup contingent 


suppliers. The decentralized control principles in Industry 4.0 


systems make it possible to diversify risks and reduce the 


need for structural SC redundancy with the help of manufac-


turing flexibility. Big data analytics and advanced trace & 


tracking systems in general, and blockchain technology in 


particular, can help us to trace the roots of disruptions, to 


observe disruption propagation (i.e., the ripple effect) (Dolgui 


et al. 2018, Ivanov et al. 2019a), to select short-term stabili-


zation actions based on a clear understanding of what capaci-


ties and inventories are available (emergency planning), to 


develop  mid-term recovery policies, and to analyse the long-


term performance impact of  ripples effects. Additive manu-


facturing has a potential to reduce disruption propagation in 


the SC, since the number of SC layers and the resulting com-


plexity would be reduced. Resilience may improve, resultant-


ly.  


Initial efforts to understand the impact of digital technologies 


on the SC risk management are underway. However, both 


conceptual and granular understandings of the contribution 


and the interplay of different digital technologies in regard to 


specific SC and operations resilience and sustainability re-


quires further analysis.  


The impact of digitalization and Industry 4.0 on the ripple 


effect and disruption risk control analytics in the SC is there-


fore a promising research avenue. The purpose of the re-


search in the given are is to investigate the interplay between 


digitalization, SC resilience, and SC risks. The scope synthe-


sizes research from two distinct areas, i.e., the impact of digi-


talization on logistics, and the impact of SC management on 


risk control. As such, the topics of this domain connect busi-

ties and inventories are available (emergency planning), to 


develop  mid-term recovery policies, and to analyse the long-


term performance impact of  ripples effects. Additive manu-


facturing has a potential to reduce disruption propagation in 


the SC, since the number of SC layers and the resulting com-


plexity would be reduced. Resilience may improve, resultant-


ly.  


Initial efforts to understand the impact of digital technologies 


on the SC risk management are underway. However, both 


conceptual and granular understandings of the contribution 


and the interplay of different digital technologies in regard to 


specific SC and operations resilience and sustainability re-


quires further analysis.  


The impact of digitalization and Industry 4.0 on the ripple 


effect and disruption risk control analytics in the SC is there-


fore a promising research avenue. The purpose of the re-


search in the given are is to investigate the interplay between 


digitalization, SC resilience, and SC risks. The scope synthe-


sizes research from two distinct areas, i.e., the impact of digi-


talization on logistics, and the impact of SC management on 


risk control. As such, the topics of this domain connect busi-

ness, information, engineering and quantitative analysis per-


spectives on digitalization to control and the SC risks issues. 


Such studies would connect business, information, engineer-


ing and analytics perspectives on digitalization and SC risks 


in order to bring the discussion further with the help of a con-


ceptual framework for researching the relationships between 


digitalization and SC disruptions risks. Examples of the ques-


tions to be answered are, e.g., (1) what relations exist be-


tween big data analytics, Industry 4.0, additive manufactur-


ing, advanced trace & tracking systems and SC disruption 


risks; (2) how digitalization can contribute to enhancing rip-


ple effect control; and (3) what digital technology-based ex-


tensions can trigger the developments towards SC risk analyt-


ics. 


At the proactive level, optimization and simulation models 


produce notable insights for managers and can be applied 


where the probability of disruption can be roughly estimated. 


On the one hand, big data analytics and advanced trace and 


tracking systems may help in predicting disruptions and 


providing more accurate data to build sophisticated disruption 


scenarios for resilient SC design analysis. Digital technolo-


gies open new problems for resilient SC design. For example, 


additive manufacturing changes SC designs whereby new 


resilient sourcing problems may arise. This area can further 


be enhanced using collaborative purchasing platforms. 


At the reactive level and with regards to mitigation strategies 


and identifying disruption impact on finance and operational 


performance, digital technologies can be extensively used to 


obtain real-time information on the scope and scale of disrup-


tions, their propagation in the SC and to simulate possible 


recovery strategies. In addition, at the reactive level, adapta-


tion is necessary for achieving desired output performance by 


ensuring the possibility of changing SC plans and inventory 


policies. Adaptation processes in ripple effect control can be 


supported by feedback and adaptive control methods using 


decentralized agent techniques with the help of digital tech-


nologies. Visualizing these processes through virtual reality-


supported simulation has not yet been done extensively to 


model the ripple effect in the SC. For this, simulation models, 


along with new digital technologies, can improve tools which 


are already used in developing SC agility and visibility in 


terms of disruption velocity.  


3 RESILEANNESS AS A COMBINATION OF RESILIENT 


AND LEAN: LOW-CERTAINTY-NEED SUPPLY 


CHAINS 


Uncertainty and risk predictions are commonly researched in 


studies of SC disruption management, mostly assuming 


known disruptive event or disruption scenario probability. 


The resulting resource allocation and costs have frequently 


resulted in expensive systems which help businesses cope 


with uncertainty. Without undermining the importance of 


further developing this common perspective, new approaches 


need to be developed that focus on the reduction of SC be-


havior dependence on environmental changes.  


The unpredictability of the occurrence of disruption and its 


magnitude suggests that designing SCs with a low need for 


“certainty” may be as important, if not more so, than prede-


termined pre-disruption strategies. While the problem of dis-


ruption impact investigation with disruption probability esti-


mations has attracted considerable research attention, some 


fundamental issues in this research stream need to be pointed 


out, such as fair probability estimation of rare events, consid-


eration of only “known” events and the exclusion of “un-


known” events, and the consideration of mainly the direct 


effects of disruptions in model outputs rather than disruption 


propagation chains and the resulting indirect effects (Mizgier 


et al. 2013, Macdonald et al. 2018). Such new perspectives in 


SC disruption management can be placed under the umbrella 


of low-certainty-need (LCN) SCs (Ivanov and Dolgui 2018). 


The ultimate objective of the LCN SCs is to develop the abil-


ity to operate according to planned performance regardless of 


environmental changes. 


The LCN SC framework suggests approaching SC disruption 


risk and the ripple effect field from another perspective. Ra-


ther than opposing the efficiency and resilience, we suggest 


considering their mutual intersections to enhance each other 


based on synergetic effects in terms of SC resileanness.  


Major costs of disruption management are seen in disruption 


prediction, protective redundancy, and reactive capabilities as 


a result of a higher need for certainty and the resulting higher 


redundancy and recovery efforts. As such, we suggest study-


ing these areas from the perspective of efficiency and resili-


ence complementarity.  


Therefore, three key elements of the LCN SC framework can 


be identified as follows: 


 Structural simplification and variety 
 Process and resource utilization flexibility  
 Efficient parametric redundancy.  


Let us discuss the principles of implementing the LCN SC 


framework in practice. The ultimate objective of the LCN SC 


design is to develop the ability to operate according to 


planned performance regardless of environmental changes. 


As such, the SC design from the position of resileanness (i.e., 


a combination of resilient and lean) possess two critical capa-


bilities, i.e., 


 low need for uncertainty consideration in planning 
decisions and 


 low need for recovery coordination efforts. 
Structural variety, process flexibility, and parametrical re-


dundancy ensure disruption-resistance and recovery resource 


allocation and allow for SC operation in a broad range of 


environmental states. This means that planning activities in 


the LCN SCs do not heavily rely on uncertainty prediction 


and proactive protection investments. Similarly, recovery 


coordination efforts are reduced to a minimum. Note that the 


LCN SC design does not necessarily imply higher costs, but 


rather seeks for an efficient combination of lean and resilient 


elements. 


3.1. Structural variety and complexity reduction 


Structural complexity reduction can be achieved by product 


line-based resilient SC segmentation with minimum intersec-


tions between the different lines, e.g., avoiding sourcing from 


the same supplier in the different lines. Such a composition 


results in a combination of lean SC design in individual 


product lines and resilient SC design. As such, disruption

propagation and the ripple effect can be reduced. A new re-


search direction focusing on lean and resilient network struc-


tures can be seen in this area. 


With regards to the structural variety, it can be recommended 


to continue using the consolidation effects subject to efficien-


cy increases. A new research direction for identifying the risk 


exposure of consolidation nodes in SCs can be pointed out in 


this area. More specifically, resilient SC designs are expected 


to use consolidation effects at low-exposure (i.e., non-


critical) network nodes. The latter aspect directly interrelates 


with the product line-based SC design. Therefore, a combina-


tion of structural variety and complexity reduction areas is 


the next new research avenue at the semantic level. 


3.2. Process and resource utilization flexibility 


Process and resource utilization flexibility means in a wider 


sense an establishment of universal, very flexible work-


stations such as those postulated in Industry 4.0 systems. 


Similar, the usage of universal materials can be considered 


with regards to recovery flexibility in the SC. Additive manu-


facturing technology can also positively influence product 


and process flexibility resulting in a combination of efficien-


cy and resilience. The decentralized control principles in In-


dustry 4.0 systems make it possible to diversify the risks with 


the help of manufacturing flexibility increases. New research 


directions can be seen with regards to the impact of the digi-


talization on the SC design resilience (Ivanov et al. 2019, 


Dubey et al. 2019a,b, Dolgui et al. 2019a,b). For example, 


Big Data analytics and advanced Trace &Tracking systems in 


general, and blockchain technology in particular, can help to 


trace the roots of disruptions, to observe disruption propaga-


tion (i.e., the ripple effect), to select short-term stabilization 


actions based on a clear understanding of what capacities and 


inventories are available (emergency planning), to develop a 


mid-term recovery policy, and to analyze the long-term per-


formance impact of the ripple effect.  


3.3. Parametric redundancy  


Non-expensive parametric redundancy targets the efficient 


reservations of capacity, inventory, and lead time. More spe-


cifically, those reservations need to be considered not as a 


non-used redundancy, but rather for use in normal operation 


modes as well. Network redundancy optimization can be 


viewed as a new research topic in this area. Another aspect of 


parametric redundancy is its efficient allocation. A new re-


search direction extending the existing value-stream mapping 


techniques towards the SC resilience can be considered. Effi-


cient redundancy can be implemented by using additive man-


ufacturing that helps to reduce the need for risk mitigation 


inventory and capacity reservations.  


4 PROACTIVE PLANNING, NETWORK REDUNDANCY 


AND SITUATIONAL RECOVERY CONTROL 


The research in ripple effect control needs to be united by 


three basic principles of system-cybernetic research. The first 


principle is the integrated modelling of resilient network 


structures.  New principles and methods of SC structural dy-


namics control will be developed using a variety of method-


ologies for multi-criteria network synthesis and analysis. A 


particular focus will be directed towards the deployment of 


post-disruption management, and understanding which fac-


tors fit the particular dynamics the SC structures confront. 


The second principle is the proactive planning and network 


redundancy optimization. The given paradigm combines both 


SC robustness (i.e., the ability to absorb disturbances and 


continue execution with minimal impact on performance), 


monitoring (i.e., real-time disruption identification and data-


driven re-planning preparation), and resilience (i.e., the abil-


ity to sustain and restore SC functionality using recovery and 


adaptation policies).  


The third principle is the situational proactive control. A dis-


ruptive event, planning of the recovery control policy, and 


implementation of this policy are distributed in time and sub-


ject to SC structural and parametrical dynamics. In other 


words, both environment, SC structures and its operational 


parameters may change in the period between the planning of 


the recovery control policy and its implementation. As such, 


situational proactive control with a combined usage of simu-


lation-optimization and analytics is needed to improve the 


transition processes from a disrupted to a restored SC state. 


This allows reducing investments in robustness and increas-


ing resilience by obviating the transition process control 


problems. A combination of these three principles builds a 


framework of future decision support systems for SC disrup-


tion risk management which utilizes two major ideas, i.e., (i) 


low-certainty need SC designs and network redundancy op-


timization with an optimal combination of robustness and 


adaptation elements to ensure both efficient and resilient SCs 


and (ii) integrated SC ripple effect modeling with simulation, 


optimization, and analytics components to support situational 


forecasting, predictive simulation, prescriptive optimization, 


and adaptive learning. 


5. DIGITAL TWIN AND RIPPLE EFFECT CONTROL: 


TOWARDS SUPPLY CHAIN RISK ANALYTICS 


Analysis of current and future research trend in ripple effect 


allows formulating two important insights which lead the 


discussion further towards SC risk analytics. 


Examples of SC and operations analytics applications include 


logistics and SC control with real-time data, inventory con-


trol, and management using sensing data, dynamic resource 


allocation in Industry 4.0 customized assembly systems, im-


proving forecasting models using Big Data, machine learning 


techniques for process control, SC visibility and risk control, 


optimizing systems based on predictive information (e.g., 


predictive maintenance), combining optimization and ma-


chine learning algorithms, and simulation-based modeling 


and optimization for stochastic systems.  


Success in SC competition will become more and more de-


pendent on analytics algorithms in combination with optimi-


zation and simulation modelling. Initially intended for pro-


cess automation, business analytics techniques now disrupt 


markets and business models and have a significant impact 


on SCM development. As such, new disruptive SC business

models will arise where SCs will be understood not as rigid 


physical systems with a fixed and static allocation of some 


processes to some firms. Instead, different physical firms will 


offer services of supply, manufacturing, logistics, and sales 


which will result in a dynamic allocation of processes and 


dynamic SC structures (Ivanov et al. 2018).  


With the help of optimization and simulation approaches, 


current research generates new knowledge about the influ-


ence of disruption propagation on SC output performance 


considering disruption location, duration and propagation and 


recovery policies. New digital technologies create new chal-


lenges for the application of quantitative analysis techniques 


to SC ripple effect analysis and open new ways and problem 


statements for these applications. 


The modelling stage is devoted to predictive simulation and 


prescriptive optimization. Disruption scenario simulation, SC 


design optimization, and recovery optimization belong to 


major decisions to be supported at this level. Structural dy-


namics control approach in combination with mathematical 


optimization can be used. Real-time control area contains 


supply flow real-time control, disruption identification, and 


real-time performance and recovery control. Feedback con-


trol can be applied in this domain with modifications. 


It is commonly known that feedback control in socio-


organizational differs from technical systems where the feed-


back can be implemented almost immediately. As such, the 


differences in the system states can be observed between the 


system state at the moment of starting to prepare the adjust-


ment decisions on the basis of the feedback information and 


the system state at the moment of decision implementation. 


In other words, delayed feedbacks occur due to system iner-


tia.  The correction (adaptation) decisions need to be imple-


mented at the object or system which is different from the 


object or system that has been considered for the reconfigura-


tion decision planning. Finally, learning stage is comprised of 


risk mitigation learning, disruption recovery learning, and 


disruption pattern recognition. A combination of control al-


gorithms and artificial intelligence can provide a number of 


new insights in the given area. 


As such, a new generation of simulation and optimization 


models can be observed that extends the decision-support 


systems (DSS) towards decision analysis, modelling, control 


and learning systems (DAMCLS) in the form of digital SC 


twins. Combination of simulation, optimization and data ana-


lytics constitutes a full stack of technologies to create a digi-


tal supply chain twin – a model that always represents the 


state of the network in real-time. At each point of time, a dig-


ital twin represents the physical SC with the actual transpor-


tation, inventory, demand, and capacity data.  


The DAMCLS system for SC risk analytics aims at proactive, 


resilient SC design in anticipation of disruptions and structur-


al-parametrical adaptation in the case of disruptions. The 


decision-support system is based on a concept that combines 


simulation, optimization, and data analytics. The Simulation-


Optimization part of the system is intended to provide proac-


tive, resilient SC optimization and simulation of SC dynamic 


behavior in the event of disruptions or disruption scenarios.  





In addition, this supports reactive, predictive simulation of 


disruption impacts on SC performance and of recovery poli-


cies which are subsequently optimized in the prescriptive 


manner using an analytical model. The data analytics part of 


the system is applied to disruption identification in real-time 


using process feedback data, e.g., from sensors and RFID. In 


addition, this aims at automated data input of disruption data 


into the reactive simulation model for recovery policy simu-


lation and optimization. Finally, data analytics is used as da-


ta-driven learning system at the proactive stage, helping to 


generate adequate disruption scenarios for resilient SC design 


and planning.
