1  | INTRODUC TION


Since the inception of Bitcoin (Law, Sabett and Solinas 1996; 
Nakamoto, 2008), mainstream media has been treating this particular 
cryptocurrency as tantamount to blockchain technology in general. 
Yet, if blockchain technology was a planet, cryptocurrencies would 
be only a small continent, with Bitcoin registering as no more than a 
single nation. The media hype over Bitcoin appears thus inversely pro-
portional to the real impact to be expected from blockchain technol-
ogy at large. The same holds true for the adverse aspects of Bitcoin. 
While it is true, for example, that currently the mining of blockchain 
products consumes energy of around 47 terawatt-hours per year, 
equal to the carbon footpring of “some 6.8 million average European 
inhabitants,” (Foteinis, 2018), high-energy use is no necessary feature 
of blockchain technology, although frequent in first-generation ap-
plications. Many second- and third-generation blockchains, however, 
are so programmed as to reduce or prevent that problem—or even 


make a net positive contribution to energy conservation, as is the case 
with “Solar Coin” (Dierksmeier & Seele, 2016).


Academic literature has accordingly begun to look beyond cryp-
tocurrencies and turn its attention toward blockchain technology 
in general. There is a plethora of work (for a recent overview see 
Klarin, 2020 or Xu, Chen, & Kou, 2019) from the angle of information 
technology, computer science, and network theory. Less ample but 
also fast growing is the literature on juridical questions, on politi-
cal regulation, and on the industrial governance of the technology. 
What lacks, thus far, are analyses from a business ethics perspective, 
though; a gap we wish to address in this paper.


After outlining the ethical unfavorable and favorable applica-
tions, we introduce three exemplary topics demonstrating the ethi-
cal ambivalence of certain blockchain applications: the role of trust, 
job platforms, and the impact on privacy and secrecy. These ambiv-
alent cases are read against major ethical theories and their consid-
eration culminates in two practical contributions: First, a call for a 
fast regulation, similar to the ongoing standardization and regula-
tion of corporate social responsibility (CSR) standards; and second,

Abstract
This paper provides, from a business ethics perspective, a basic clustering of the 
morally (a) favorable, (b) unfavorable, and (c) ambivalent dimensions of blockchain 
technology and its various emergent applications. Instead of proffering specific as-
sessments on particular aspects of blockchain-based business models, we aim to offer 
an initial overview that charters the territory so that future research can bring about 
such moral assessments in an informed and orderly fashion. The main contribution 
of this paper lies in identifying several morally ambivalent dimensions of blockchain 
technology, which we finally link to two strands of business ethics research: ethical 
and legal aspects of legislation as well as a link to Habermasian corporate social re-
sponsibility theory arguing for transparent data production and consumption on the 
blockchain. We conclude that future research is necessary for moral assessment of 
the ambivalent cases, since their ethical evaluation changes depending on whether 
one analyzes them through the lenses of utilitarianism, contractarianism, deontology, 
and virtue ethics, respectively.


For valuable feedback and constructive criticism, we wish to thank the anonymous 
reviewers of our paper.

a more transparent and participatory data usage on the blockchain.


2  | CONTRIBUTION AND LIMITATIONS


Our contribution is to offer a first overview of the significance of 
blockchain technology for business ethics, charting the territory to 
be investigated by further research. Our aim is to work out morally 
salient features of the technology so as facilitate their critical scru-
tiny. Beyond blockchain applications which uncontroversially may be 
judged as morally good or bad, respectively, we want to draw the 
readers’ attention even more to such aspects and use cases whose 
ethical evaluation is anything but obvious, shifting decidedly with 
the respective moral theory employed. This oscillation in moral as-
sessment, we argue, indicates the issue deserves further study.


In the scope of this paper, we probe perspectives proffered by 
utilitarians, contractarians, deontologists, and virtue theorists. The se-
lection of these lenses over others is a deliberate limitation, owed to 
the exploratory nature of our paper. We hold that, at this early stage 
of blockchain development, a versatile tool for further investigation is 
more useful for our colleagues than any attempt on our part to advance 
definite ethical assessments on particular features of the technology. 
Rather, we want to provide the wherewithal to the business ethics 
community to work toward such evaluations in a systematic fashion by 
ordering of central aspects of blockchain technology in clusters of un-
favorable, favorable, and yet ambiguous or ambivalent characteristics.


Our clustering follows the ethical repercussions of the technology 
rather than primary features of the technology itself (for a more general 
review see Klarin, 2020 or Xu et al., 2019). Herein lies another deliber-
ate limitation of our paper. Within the scope of this paper, we cannot 
exhaustively describe the wide ambit of real and potential use cases. 
We thus picked moral significance over ontological comprehensiveness. 
By showcasing how oftentimes one and the same application may lead 
to divergent moral judgments according to divergent ethical theories, 
our paper aims to bring out the need for further research in this area.


The clustering is organized around particularly significant exam-
ples for each of the categories. The selection of the examples—being 
by no means is comprehensive—followed a “constrained snowball 
sampling technique” (Lecy & Beatty, 2012) and led us to 209 use 
cases. The list was finalized in July 2018.1  The “assignment of data 
objects [here: blockchain applications] into groups (called clusters)” 
[here: our three clusters ethically unfavorable, favorable, and ambiv-
ilant] helped us to cluster phenomenologically similar objects (Reddy 
& Ussenaiah, 2012, see also Levin, 2015 or Premalatha & Natarajan, 
2010). The clustering was accomplished in two consensus sessions 
by the authors. In these sessions, we identified the three most perti-
nent examples (see Table 1) by selecting those with heightened sig-
nificance for individuals (job platforms), society at large (trust) and 
with transverse impact upon on the micro, meso, and macro level 
of society (privacy/secrecy). We chose the three categories of nor-
mative evaluation (ethically favorable, unfavorable, and ambivalent) 
which have already been applied in the literature on the related topic T

of cryptocurrencies (Dierksmeier & Seele, 2016), and employed them 
here so as analyse further morally pertinent repercussions such as 
the undermining of public infrastructures, harm to third parties, ef-
forts in CSR-oriented supply chain management as well as in institu-
tion building for base-of-the-pyramid customers, and questions of 
surveillance (Cavazos, Rutherford, & Berman, 2018).


We begin in the subsequent section (Section 3) with a brief expo-
sition of relevance of blockchain for the world of business. The paper 
then proceeds as follows: A collection of applications of blockchain 
technology cases (exempting the analysis of cryptocurrencies, already 
dealt with in Dierksmeier & Seele, 2016) is organized in three chapters 
illustrating unfavorable (Section 4) and favorable (Section 5) uses of 
blockchain technology. Then we try to shed some light on morally am-
bivalent uses (Section 6) by examining them along the lines of the eth-
ical theories of utilitarianism, contractarianism, deontology, and virtue 
ethics. Finally, we present specific outcomes for the field of business 
ethics (Section 7) and arrive at proposals for future research (Section 8).


3  | HOW ARE WE TO FR AME 
BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY 
THEORETIC ALLY?


The ethical salience of blockchain technology is not merely a de-
rivative of the real-world impact of its applications in business and 
society. In addition, blockchain technology also deserves the atten-
tion of ethicists for the novel ways by which these ramifications are 
wrought. Oftentimes, when scholars underscore these latter as-
pects of blockchain technology, they highlight its decentral, demo-
cratic, and disintermediary nature. Indeed, decentralized networks 
can eliminate power asymmetries that usually work to the benefit 
of intermediaries (like notaries, banks, brokers, headhunters, etc.) 
between contracting parties. Moreover, they can accomplish this 
without introducing a central node able to engage in rent-seeking 
or dominating behavior (Drescher, 2017). Consequently, the block-
chain-based data system cannot, as a rule, be dominated by any one 
node in the system (for a taxonomy and systems classification see 
Ballandies, Dapp, & Pournaras, 2018, p. 10). The general assump-
tion of commentators is, therefore, that blockchain protocols offer 
unprecedented degrees of transparency and accuracy which, apart 
from representing, to many authors, a direct moral advantage in 
their own right, allow for further indirect benefits such as a dramatic 
acceleration and cost reduction in automated transaction systems—
with enormous disruptive potentials for more traditional, hierar-
chical business models (Kuebler, 2018). Accordingly, the advent of 
blockchain has been welcomed as a chance to realize humanist vi-
sions of peaceful, collaborative forms of business by empowering 
individuals while undermining the priviledges of the established and 
entrenched (Pirson, Gangahar, & Wilson, 2016).


At first, all new software-based technologies are the purview of 
those with the requisite coding skills—but not for long. Nowadays, 
almost anyone can build their own website by choosing from from 
a large number of toolboxes, obviating the need for the acquisition 


of, say, html-programming skills. Likewise, firms like Proxeus and 
Cocol are offering programs designed to make blockchain accessible 
to the masses. Users with standard needs can choose from a drag- 
and-drop menu of solutions so as to construct their own custom-made 
blockchains without having to programme them from scratch (in-
side-it, 2018).


Numerous pundits (such as Bobby Lee (see Deuber, 2018 or 
Kuebler, 2018)) predict that blockchain will revolutionize various 
fields of business, notably those reliant on intermediaries for es-
tablishing of trust in transactions between strangers. Blockchain 
technology, it is said, can help manage payments, facilitate micro-
payments, deliver notary services, certify compliance and audit 
processes, manage records, establish voting procedures (Leonard, 
2018) as well as bring transparency to value holdings and transfers 
(World Economic Forum, 2016). Moreover, blockchain is projected 
to democratize venture financing through facilitating crowdfunding 
(Greenberg & Mollick, 2016; Mollick & Nanda, 2015) and by making 
access to capital more egalitarian.


Blockchain's potentials also extend to tracking digital goods, 
provenance checks, digital rights management, the securing of digital 
identities and information, counterfeit protection, and the establish-
ment of autonomous organizations (Goel, 2015). As a consequence, 
the locus of value creation may meander out of the ambit of tra-
ditional firms toward the firm–society interface and/or fluid digital 
networks (Risius & Spohrer, 2017) with governance structures more 
akin to informal barter, bazaars, and social contracts than to con-
ventional corporate hierarchies (Miscione, Ziolkowski, Zavolokina, & 
Schwabe, 2017; Reijers, O'Brolcháin, & Haynes, 2016). At the same 
time, blockchain-based governance has the potential to impact how 
offline or online markets are run and how commons are managed, 
thus invigorating many a staid debate of business ethics by offering 
novel technological avenues to challenge the status quo.


Due to the pervasiveness of their potential use cases, the pro-
tocols of blockchain software and the implicit social norms underly-
ing them are bound to have notable impact on business and society 
(Davidson, Filippi, & Potts, 2018). Present use cases—from simple 
payment systems to so-called smart contracts that enable and en-
force contractual performances (Buterin, 2013; Szabo, 1996)—have 
already begun to alter the way we organize and remunerate work 
(Iansiti & Lakhani, 2017). Over time, the nature of remunerated 
work might change since blockchain accelerates the trend toward 
the automation and standardization of business procedures. Jobs 
consisting in routine tasks may be lost, opportunities for more cre-
ative labor might open up (Stein, 2018). Should these effects not be 
managed politically, inequality between incomes stands to increase. 
Whether these distributional affects might be mitigated by a decou-
pling of effort and income, for example, through a Universal Basic 
Income, is presently being discussed. This discussion can stand in as 
an exemplar for the need to accompany this technological shift with 
ethical reflection and political regulation.


We approach the ethical assessment of digital technologies from 
the angle of “information ethics” as advanced by Floridi (1999, 2013). 
Floridi defines “information ethics” as “the branch of the philosophy 






     |  351DIERKSMEIER anD SEELE


of information that investigates the ethical impact of Information and 
Communication Technologies on human life and society” (Floridi, 2013). 
Businesses are a key driver for information ethics and digital ethics since 
the locus of development of such technologies is frequently in corporate 
environments. Also, given ongoing development of blockchain technol-
ogy in start-ups and through cryptocurrency programmers, a prima facie 
case for including questions of digital and information ethics into the 
field business ethics (see also the conclusions section of this paper).


In the following sections, we present specific cases of ethically 
unfavorable applications (Section 4) and ethically favorable applica-
tions (Section 5) before analyzing in more depth crucial applications 
of blockchain technology which are ethically ambivalent (Section 6).


4  | ETHIC ALLY UNFAVOR ABLE 
APPLIC ATIONS


When it comes to morally unfavorable business applications, the 
havoc wreaked by blockchain technology is often so stark as to make 
for an additional argument for the ethical salience of the topic. The 
same holds inversely, as shown in the subsequent section, for the 
prosocial capacities of the technology. In either case, blockchain's abil-
ity to remodel, on a global scale, the way people interact in business 
and society is huge, as the subsequently selected use cases illustrate.


It is well known that many blockchain-based cryptocurrencies 
enable money laundering and numerous other illegal transactions via 
anonymous black markets for drugs, illegal pornography or weap-
ons (Seele, 2018). Beyond such currency-centered cases, blockchain 
technology enables further types of illegal and/or immoral trans-
actions by facilitating transactions without intermediaries who can 
personally be held accountable for those transactions.


A case in point are “assassination markets.” AUGUR is an 
Ethereum-based blockchain application for the creation of “peer-to-
peer prediction markets” which allow people to place bets secretly 
(Orcutt, 2018). Already among conventional prediction markets, 
death pools are nothing unfamiliar. But now AUGUR has created 
something akin to a veritable “assassination market” (Oberhaus, 
2018) in that it allows to place anonymous bets upon someone's 
death, which in turn may incentivize people to kill others so as 
to win these very bets. While versions of “digital assassination” 
(Sukumaran, 2004) have been around for several years, what is 
new is that through blockchain technology such bets can be placed 
anonymously as quasi-orders. Who is to be held accountable? The 
company behind AUGUR simply states that it “does not operate or 
control, nor can it control, what markets and actions people perform 
and create on the Augur protocol” (Orcutt, 2018).


Another criminal phenomenon is “cryptojacking,” which refers to 
programs secretly mining cryptocurrencies (Li, 2017). Initially, users were 
tricked into downloading cryptojacking software, but increasingly such 
malware infects also broadly used browsers. For criminals, the employ-
ment of cryptojacking programs results the more attractive, the more 
computing power the affected hardware has. As a consequence, crypto-
jackers have begun attacks on critical infrastructure organizations with 


high-performance computers. Thus their private gain-seeking comes at 
a cost to the public because such computing infrastructure is typically 
employed by public utilities and providers of infrastructure (Newman, 
2018). In the case of the European water utility company Radiflow, for 
instance, hackers installed a malware program on a network of the com-
pany which runs a facility to monitor water supply; an action which could 
have led to a standstill of the entire plant with serious repercussions for 
the public (Newman, 2018).


Whereas regular cyberjacking involves outsider hackers, there 
are also cases of inhouse-hijacking. The BBC reported recently how 
a number of scientists working for a top-secret Russian nuclear 
warhead installed a software to mine cryptocurrencies on one of 
Russia's “most powerful supercomputers” in a restricted area at the 
“Federal Nuclear Center” in Sarow (BBC, 2018). The security threat 
such actions pose is obviously immense.


The risks of engaging with blockchain products extend also to 
regular users. Blockchain software typically requires for reasons of 
system integrity that all nodes store the entire transaction history in 
the network's distributed ledger, including any and all past transac-
tions. Recently, though, researchers found that such safeguarding of 
information exposes users to the risk of being held accountable for 
“arbitrary blockchain content” (Matzutt et al., 2018). When analyz-
ing the blockchains of some cryptocurrencies, the researchers found 
sensitive data from previous users in the data trail, “including poten-
tially harmful content,” for example “illegal pornography” (Matzutt 
et al., 2018). This makes each user—unwittingly—a co-owner of such 
illegal data. If, however, people can incriminate themselves merely by 
owning cryptocurrencies, then endless opportunities exist for using 
just this feature of blockchains so as to blackmail unsuspecting users.


In regard to such ethically unfavorable outcomes, defenders of 
blockchain argue that these are largely attributable to a lack of reg-
ulation. In their view, one ought to use such examples not as argu-
ments against blockchain technology per se but instead as rationales 
for its proper governance and policing; we will come back to this 
point in Sections 7 and 8.


5  | ETHIC ALLY FAVOR ABLE 
APPLIC ATIONS


In this section, we again present use cases of blockchain whose—
now positive—immoral nature will appear uncontroversial and 
whose relevance for business ethics can be gleaned, so to speak, 
with the naked eye.


Scholarly consensus has it that blockchain 2.0 and 3.0 appli-
cations, especially when combining blockchains with the inter-
net-of-things (IoT), are opening up entirely new worlds of global 
commerce and collaboration (Swan, 2015), often with decidedly 
pro-social ramifications (Griffith, 2018),2  which has already spawned 
a discussion on “blockchain for good” (Adams, Kewell, & Parry, 2017).


Blockchain advocates point, for instance, to the chance of making 
supply chains transparent. Some blockchain providers, such as VeChain 
(and more recently also Circulor, IBM, and several others), are combining 






352  |     DIERKSMEIER anD SEELE


supply chain management with the smart contract feature of block-
chains (Chitkara, 2019). Objects in the supply chain are being linked to 
the internet and equipped with Radio Frequency Identification chips, or 
similar tracking devices, that can be read out remotely. This leads to a full 
disclosure in real time of all transactions in the supply chain.


Take a look, for instance, at VeChain's collaboration partners: PwC 
(Ng, 2018) helps monitor the practical implementation of VeChain's 
blockchain; Deutsche Bahn/Schenker runs a pilot project on logistics, 
and DNV GL, a Norwegian registrar company, is co-developing with 
VeChain a digital system to enhance the trustworthiness of blockchain 
data through certified assurances concerning the data input. Given 
the important role of assurance in CSR information (Martínez-Ferrero 
& García-Sánchez, 2017), blockchain-based supply chain applications 
make important steps toward the datafication of business ethics tenets.


In sum, such applications are likely to impact the perception of 
products monitored, when demonstrating to end users, for instance, 
the environmental sustainability of the wares they are about to pur-
chase or when assuring that no human right violations or child labor 
were involved in their production. For corporations, the fact that thus 
CSR governance becomes more transparent might reduce accusations 
of greenwashing or bluewashing since supply chain data, once stored 
in the blockchain, is tamperproof. Finally, corporate communication 
stands to benefit from standardized, assured data management of fi-
nancial and nonfinancial data. Much of what, say, the Global Reporting 
Initiative aims to standardize in CSR reporting could thus digitally be 
validated and instantly made available to regulators and investors.


Whereas VeChain is a platform blockchain application for an in-
definite number of users and companies, several multinational cor-
porations develop proprietary blockchain-based applications. De 
Beers, the South African mining company, for example, uses block-
chain software to tackle the problem of “blood-diamonds.” As part 
of their sustainability strategy, De Beers has embarked on a fair min-
ing process, aiming for a “guaranteed diamond purity” (Lewis, 2018). 
The problem they face is twofold. First, the extraction of diamonds 
occurs frequently in countries with low respect for human rights, 
where child labor is widespread, and/or it often involves the use of 
toxic chemicals to separate diamonds from the soil. Second, dia-
monds are often used for money laundering and smuggling. DeBeers 
digital supply chain tracking has therefore “both consequences for 
the ethicality of the diamond as well as for protecting the business 
of the company,” as via its own blockchain DeBeers can now track 
the diamond “each time they change hands starting from the mo-
ment they are dug from the ground” (Lewis, 2018). The digital record 
providing information of the origin of the diamond is public and im-
mutable, which gives DeBeers a reputation advantage against com-
petitors. A further implication is theft prevention, since the unique 
molecular pattern stored on the blockchain remains always identi-
fiable. As a result, any unauthorized owner can, in principle, be de-
tected, and the diamond returned to the real owner.


Also, Swiss bank UBS is after this property protection transpar-
ency feature of blockchain software so as help art collectors pro-
tect their assets (Gerber, 2017). The business case for registering a 
Van Gogh on a blockchain lies in making this piece of art “bankable” 


(Gerber, 2017), which means tradable without the help (and related 
costs) of intermediaries such as art brokers. Here again, the moral 
and commercial improvement go hand in hand. The consistent trace-
ability of ownership—which reduces costs for vendors and purvey-
ors—also prevents money laundering, black market trading, and 
other illegal transactions common to the art market (Lewis, 2018).


Similarly, in collaboration with the blockchain startup Xain, 
car maker Porsche plans to implement blockchain technology 
(Buchenau, 2018). Apart from ownership protection, Porsche's in-
terest in storing data about its cars on a blockchain comes from its 
efforts to advance automated driving. Managing a car's data through 
a blockchain might help protect it against hacking; surely, an import-
ant selling point for their automated cars, should Porsche succeed.


Moreover, the ability to gain tamper-free proof of one's assets is of 
particular interest to persons in environments with unsatisfying legal 
institutions. Once digitized in the blockchain, such information can 
be accessed remotely, without having to go through (potentially cor-
rupt) officials. This feature may afford people additional chances to 
capitalize on their economic properties. Several years ago, Hernando 
de Soto (2001) argued that a key factor holding people back in pov-
erty were bureaucratic obstacles on the path toward self-employ-
ment and entrepreneurship. For instance, obtaining a credit to open 
a business can be a nightmare for many slum dwellers. They might 
not have adequate proof of their real estate so as to mortgage it and 
put it up as collateral. Through blockchain-based data storage solu-
tions (offered by Etherty, Trust, etc.), such information can now be 
accessible instantaneously and worldwide, also to help address CSR 
issues of public good (Schultz & Seele, 2019). In fact, some cities in 
both North and South America have already begun to put up their 
registries of deeds onto publically accessible blockchains.


Similarly, indigenous persons often face comparable burdens 
in authenticating their identity vis-à-vis potential lenders. Through 
blockchain-based identity corroboration systems, borrowers would 
no longer be confined to (potentially extortionary) lenders within their 
local neighborhoods but could enter a global market where, at pres-
ent, ever more fintechs and social banks are eager to serve customers 
from the base of the pyramid. Thus the introduction of blockchain 
technology to developing countries might, by way of institutional 
leapfrogging, assist them to progress legally as well as economically.


6  | ETHIC ALLY AMBIVALENT 
APPLIC ATIONS


Some applications of blockchain technology resist an easy clas-
sification as either morally unfavorable or favorable. In fact, their 
moral assessments alters according to the respective ethical lenses 
employed. Such moral ambiguities are what the subsequent exam-
ples—focused on trustless trust (a), job platforms (b), and privacy and 
secrecy (c)—are meant to tease out. In the remainder of this paper, 
we will use a utilitarian, contractarian, deontological, and virtue ethi-
cal perspective to showcase different ethical interpretations of ap-
plications that are presently coming to market. This list of those four

ethical theories is not meant to be exhaustive but explorative, as 
they serve to highlight contestable moral dimensions of the technol-
ogy. We invite further research employing additional ethical lenses 
so as to amplify these moral perspectives in the interest of a more 
comprehensive assessment of the issue at hand.


6.1 | Trustless trust?


Blockchain technology reduces the need for personal or institutional 
trust in business by offering a software-based alternative to trans-
acting through trustworthy intermediaries. Reliant on depersonal-
ized transparency and record-keeping, blockchain solutions can not 
only be faster (Schütz et al., 2018), but also reduce opportunities to 
misuse trust, or to have people pay too dearly for the assurance of 
reliability. To the extent that classical intermediaries such as notaries, 
banks, and assessors may overcharge clients, blockchain technology 
promises to restore the customer-first orientation of competitive 
markets.3  Moreover, through both the global reach of blockchain-
based solutions and their availability at lower cost, their services 
are now coming into the reach of clients for whom they previously 
would have been either unattainable or unaffordable. In particular, 
with a view to making financial and legal services more accessable to 
the world's poor, this is a beneficial outcome (Thomason et al., 2018).


At the same time, though, the fact that blockchains replace “trust 
in the unerring logic of computer-based verification and the power 
of consensus” may soon enough “change our perception of trust and 
reliability on the individual level as well as on the level of the society.” 
(Drescher, 2017, p. 244). How desirable would be a world of business 
that relies less and less on face-to-face interactions and personal 
trust? Or rather, are we simply replacing trust in familiar intermedi-
aries with trust in software experts who facilitate and control these 
alternatives? And how do we know that the latter deserve our trust 
more than the former (Hawlitschek, Notheisen, & Teubner, 2018)? 
Moreover, if ever fewer people are bestowing and earning trust in 
the economy, how does this impact society in the long run? Is there 
a trade-off between commercial efficiency and cultural capacity? 
What, if so, ought to be preferred? It is in regard to such questions 
that the grand schools of ethics come to notably different answers.


Utilitarian's might make their peace with a shift from trust to trans-
parency (Brännmark, 2009). Provided that the exchange of goods and 
services would speed up and become more affordable so as to extend 
its benefits to hitherto excluded groups, utilitarian's should be willing 
to purchase this quantifiable increase in enhanced aggregate utility at 
the price of a reduction in a good (i.e., commercial trust) whose contri-
bution to the happiness of all is less tangible by comparison.


Contractarians in turn would probably run their assessment via 
the “volenti non fit inuria” (“to a willing person, injury is not done”)—
formula of Roman Law (Slingerland, 2017). As long as people can 
freely choose between conventional (trust-based) and block-
chain-enabled (transparency-based) transactions and then opt for 
the latter, contractarians should hold this transition to be morally 
warranted by the free choices that drive it; the only caveat being that 


the choice truly was voluntary, which, however, might become a pre-
carious presupposition over time: With ever more people opting for 
blockchain solutions, path dependencies might ensue that de facto, 
albeit not de jure, could restrict people's options—and so force an 
ethical reassessment on part of contractarians.


Deontologists might have stronger qualms. While—in their legal 
ethics—deontologists also fend for the freedom to contract (within 
certain ethical limits) and are poised to defend people's commer-
cial choices and the legal autonomy undergirding them, they might 
nonetheless—within the realm of moral philosophy proper—come 
to a different assessment. That is, whereas deontologists might not 
want to restrict legally the options to choose from, they do exhort 
people to scrutinize individually the moral nature of their chosen op-
tions, for example, in regard to preserving trust throughout society.


Kant, for one, formulated much stricter moral than legal impera-
tives (Dierksmeier, 2013). While the former are concerned with pre-
venting collisions of the outer freedom expressed in people's actions, 
the latter enjoin people's outer freedom on behalf of moral goals. 
According to Kant's moral doctrine, everyone is to contribute to a 
“highest good” of justified happiness, that is, a state of society where 
those, who morally deserve it, also reap just reward (Dierksmeier, 
2013). Accordingly, both the motives for a choice between trust-
based or transparency-based business opportunities and the 
likely societal outcomes of this choice must be weighed by each. 
Heteronomous motives (i.e., to choose on purely selfish grounds) 
would have to yield to ones autonomously endorsed by universal-
izable reasons. Likewise, the possible outcomes of technological 
options would have to be scrutinized by taking the wider view and 
pondering whether the foreseeable effects of these choices would 
help or hinder a progress toward said “highest good.” As, according 
to Kant, the outcome of such deliberations cannot be foreseen in an 
abstract and general fashion ex ante, such problems must be worked 
out concretely, case by case, by the moral judgment of each person in 
their particular context. In short, a deontological evaluation does not 
lead to a uniform stance either pro or contra making the shift from 
trust to transparency but puts the onus of this assessment onto the 
judgment of each and every decider personally (Lennerfors, 2007).


Therein a Kantian comes close to the “phronesis” focus of virtue 
ethicists. Committed to the flourishing of persons through personal 
excellence (Sison, 2003), virtue ethicits afford a high rank to the indi-
vidual ability to bestow and earn trust in life's long school of charac-
ter formation and integrity development. Whether or not, given this 
perspective, a deviation from trust-based business models could still 
be warranted by the expected benefits of blockchain technology, 
must be judged in each case afresh, by every concerned individual. 
The result may then well be at times in favor of a slower but more 
personalized conduct of business.


6.2 | Job platforms


At present, several start-ups are rushing to market that aspire 
to change the way people collaborate with the goal to bring back 






354  |     DIERKSMEIER anD SEELE


autonomy to workers and to help them find employment that suits 
their talents and aspirations, for example, by lowering the costs of, 
and by reducing bias in, the recruiting process (Bhatia et al. 2018). 
Some blockchain upstarts (like TiiQu) are cutting out conventional 
middlemen such as headhunters and replace them with algorithms 
that establish the professional trustworthiness of job candidates 
based on certified competences, recorded in a globally accessible 
and tamperproof blockchain. The matching algorithms employed are 
deliberately designed so as to prevent the impact of stereotypes in 
hiring decisions (based on gender, ethnicity, age, etc.) and to hinder 
corruption (https ://github.com/TiiQu-Netwo rk/TiiQu-Netwo rk/
wiki/White-Paper ).


Not always, certainly, is disintermediation unambiguously bene-
ficial. But to the extent that tasks and profiles are already standard-
ized so as to allow for meritocratic matching, such algorithms may 
indeed be an improvement. While previous digital technologies had 
already dissociated capacity sets and personal identifies in digitized 
application processes (Barron, Bishop, & Dunkelberg, 1985), they 
were hitherto still hampered by a single point of failure: If the central 
node in the respective network was corrupt, so might be the match-
ings between prospective employers and employees. This problem 
decentralized blockchains promise to solve.


Other new entrants to the blockchain scene set out to overhaul 
entirely how entrepreneurial ideas become realities. Assuming 
that much more people would dare to become entrepreneurs, if 
only the administrative, bureaucratic, logistical, and financial bur-
dens could be lowered, some start-ups (like your company) have 
begun to automate the process of incorporation, offering a block-
chain-based default structure for a (financial, logistical, juridical) 
support network for would-be entrepreneurs (https ://www.your.
company). Anyone with spare resources (time, knowledge, skills, 
assets, etc.) on their hand can enter this network freely and pe-
ruse various projects on display. By self-selecting which business 
project and/or corporate infrastructure people want to strengthen 
through their services and assistance, supporters commit their 
labor whichever projects appear most deserving to them. What 
attracts collaborators is thus not money in the first place but the 
perceived worthiness of the respective projects. This in turn in-
troduces a democratic element into the online marketplace, since, 
whereas capital is unequally distributed, everyone has 24 hr/day 
on hand.


The governance of these two aforementioned networks is 
meant to be as democratic as its organizational structure is decen-
tralized. For instance, people gain influence over the respective 
network and its digital ecosystem in proportion to their contribu-
tions to platform-based projects. As a consequence, the typical 
bifurcation between management or owners on one hand and the 
creative class and those putting in “sweat equity” on the other is 
transformed into a governance structure where influence is rather 
aligned with contribution. Such upstarts could thus not only quan-
titatively broaden access to the global economy to all persons 
with internet access, but also qualitatively alter the power matrix 
characteristic of traditional job markets in a more meritocratic 


way. Thus, blockchain technology intensifies an ongoing process 
where inter-firm and market-firm boundaries become increasingly 
blurred and new constellations at the business-society interface 
arise (Catalini, 2017).


For the reasons stated, from the perspective of utilitarianism, 
such developments appear net-positive: To succeed, platform firms 
need to reach economies of scale, which they will only achieve when 
they sufficiently satisfy the wants of their clients; and where more 
people voluntarily agree to transact, one can, supposing rational be-
havior on the part of market participants, conclude that aggregate 
utility must have been increased.


Similarly optimistic should be the assessment of contractarians. 
Where uncoerced contracts are concluded, their voluntary nature 
signals that the freedom of the involved parties was both respected 
and enacted: The offers of blockchain-based brokers ought thus 
to be welcomed as advancing the liberty of each to find forms of 
gainful employment and meaningful cooperation. This assessment, 
however, presumes that the choice between blockchain-based and 
conventional modes of contracting be permanent; a presupposi-
tion endangered by any success of blockchain technology so over-
whelming as to wipe out its conventional alternative. In that case, 
a path-dependency toward blockchain-based contracting would be 
created undermining the very freedom of choice that legitimated its 
predominance in the first place. Contractarians may, given such a 
scenario, well differ as to whether they would then reject such an 
outcome as illiberal or still accept it as the congealed result of past 
choices.


Deontologists, too, aim to promote individuals’ freedom to con-
tract, and for that reason they also might be wary of said path 
dependencies. Their commitment to contribute to fair governance 
for all should, however, make them chary of economic structures 
that put public powers into private hands. Firms brokering deals 
essential for the livelihood of many assume enormous powers 
over people's lives and thus ought to be subject to public scru-
tiny. Moreover, norms that regulate the encounters on such plat-
forms are not merely technological but also expressive of value 
standards. A deontologist should, therefore, press such firms on 
their specific understandings of “biased” versus “meritocratic 
standards” when they promise to replace the former through 
the latter. Deontologists typically opt for procedures which as-
sure that—directly or by way of representation—all concerned by 
given decisions are involved in bringing them about (Bowie, 1998). 
Something akin to the slogan “no regulation without representa-
tion” might be fielded by a deontologist in pursuit of the public 
oversight of the quasi-public powers of blockchain platforms, 
which is why a blanket endorsement of such platforms cannot be 
expected from a deontologist position.


Virtue ethicists might be even more critical of the new online mar-
kets for labor, as their focus lies on each particular individual and his 
or her chances to develop moral excellence (Sison, 2003). The fact 
that large numbers of would-be employees and employers may be 
catered to by blockchain-based matching portals for the gig econ-
omy, cannot, on this view, simply outweigh the risks posed by the

anonymization and facelessness of these systems. For that reason, a 
virtue ethicist would judge these novel opportunities not in bulk but 
assess their mettle on a case-by-case basis in direct comparison with 
the conventional conduits of match-making they replace. On bal-
ance, though, we should assume that the very fact which advocates 
of these platforms adduce in their favor,that is, an anonymous and 
abstract matching of persons to tasks—should make virtue ethicists 
skeptical rather than enthusiastic.


6.3 | Privacy and secrecy


Most societies highly value privacy and secrecy. The privacy of mail 
and the secrecy of voting, for instance, are viewed widely as both 
private and public goods of an elevated status, their protection typi-
cally being enshrined in constitutional law. Blockchain challenges 
this status quo, given their unlimited record-keeping. Yet, at the same 
time, some blockchain providers already are rolling out “privacy 
first” cloud services (e.g., the one from Oasis Labs (Takahashi, 2018)) 
so as to recreate privacy and secrecy in blockchain environments.


What throws blockchains’ ambivalent impact on privacy and se-
crecy into sharp relief is the proclaimed “cryptovalley” or “cryptopo-
lis” for the two Swiss blockchain centers Zug and Chiasso (for more 
details see Seele, 2018). After the US had successfully pressured 
Switzerland to modify Swiss bank secrecy laws so as to disincentiv-
ize international tax fraud, many fear that blockchain-based cryp-
tocurrencies may now become the “next Swiss bank account 2.0.” 
Other countries known for their mild fiscal legislation might warm 
to such ideas as well, like Malta which already markets itself as a 
“Blockchain Island” (Visram, 2018).


With a view to such regulatory grey zones, the head of the U.S. 
finance department, Steven Mnuchin, recently declared that the US 
was the only country that presently has the technological means to 
track all blockchain-based transactions. If true, this introduces right 
away the next ethical problem. Information that is secret to most but 
transparent to a select few: how are we to assess this asymmetry? 
And what if such powers would one day get into the hands of rogue 
states or criminal organizations? There is a need for a deeper dis-
cussion of the specificities of these scenarios than can be provided 
in the scope of this paper. At a more general level, though, we can 
glean where the respective ethical schools would place their empha-
sis, respectively.


As consequentialists, utilitarians value neither privacy nor se-
crecy as good (or bad) in themselves but based on their impact on 
aggregate utility. Where a loss of privacy or secrecy comes at low 
social costs, the benefits from a wider dispersion of information may 
well carry the day. The end of privacy might be welcomed on utilitar-
ian grounds, supposing that the loss of intimacy-related happiness 
to some would, in the sum total, be more than balanced out by the 
thus enabled reduction of crime, tax evasion, or nefarious commerce 
and the suffering they cause. So, for utilitarians, the fact that the US 
might be privy to information foreclosed to other nations would not 
be morally problematic in itself, as long as the US would thus snuff 


out enough negative externalities that otherwise reduce people's 
overall utility. The topic becomes an issue for utilitarians, however, 
as soon as nations or parties reacted so adversely to this asymmet-
ric state of affairs as to produce net-negative effects of aggregate 
happiness.


Contractarians, too, might find it difficult to take a principled 
stance against the loss of privacy and secrecy. If parties agree freely 
to disclose information, a contractarian will find no harm therein. 
Moreover, the contractualist commitment is to a marketplace where 
people make voluntarily exchanges. Since all turns on the voluntari-
ness of transactions, contractarians hedge against any influence that 
might force the hands of the contracting parties. Covert influences 
depend on their secrecy. Less secrecy means more truly voluntary 
commerce. As a result, contractarians can oppose a loss of privacy 
only in cases where the exclusivity of information is both essential 
to the nature of a commercial transaction (such as, say, in copyright 
agreements) and of negligible harm to third parties. In most other 
cases, they would have to embrace it.


For deontologists, a clear ethical stance is hard to come by. On one 
hand, with Kant, they tend to highly esteem “publicity” as a means 
to find out whether certain policies might lesion individual rights 
(Keienburg, 2011). Where privacy and secrecy stand to conflict with 
such publicity, the former have to yield. On the other hand, deontol-
ogists value that, within states of law, people enjoy autonomy so as 
to develop themselves freely. To the extent that privacy as well as 
secrecy contribute to the formation of characters inclined to make a 
responsible use of their freedoms, deontologists do not want to see 
them abolished. With blockchain technology, either orientation may 
pull them in a different direction. Say, an individual is about to use 
a cryptocurrency both within the limits of legality and in ways that 
could pass an additional universalization test for morality, is this per-
son then also to factor in how their behavior might bolster a payment 
system which others could use for nefarious purposes? As deontol-
ogists are wont to advise people to enact “the change they want to 
see in the world,” for the use of blockchain-technologies this stricture 
certainly demands acute cosmopolitan circumspection from deciders.


Virtue ethicists might share these concerns and focus even more 
on actor-centered aspects. Admonishing people to use commercial 
life as a form of moral education and character formation, the man-
date of virtue ethics would likely be that people employ blockchain 
technologies always so as to foster individual flourishing and the 
common good. Sometimes secrecy and privacy will be conducive 
to this agenda, and in such instances, virtue ethicists would then as 
clearly advocate against the employment of technologies reducing 
informational exclusivity as they would have to come out in their 
favor as soon as the reduction of secrecy and privacy seems likely to 
enhance the chances for ethical flourishing on part of the transact-
ing parties. Again, a blanket endorsement or rejection of blockchain 
technology in this regard cannot be expected.


In sum, to structure and visualize the previous examples we pres-
ent a summary table (Table 1) providing guidance and information on 
the three cases and the business ethics implications we derive from 
them in the next chapter.






356  |     DIERKSMEIER anD SEELE


Before concluding, we need to point to some further ambiguities 
resulting from fact that the technology is still very much in flux. Certain 
problems of decentralized data keeping are presently being tackled by 
competing approaches. This extends to alternatives within the realm 
of blockchain software (e.g., the tension between private and public 
blockchains) as well as to alternatives to blockchain technology (as by 
DAG—directed acyclical graph—technology) with their very own trans-
formational potentials and hazards (Serramia et al., 2018).


First, there is the concern that the benefits of an unhackable 
decentralized network rely on a vast number of nodes all busily cor-
roborating but one transaction history. Thus, enormous amounts of 
computing power are spent which slows down the speed of ledger 
writing, potentially to the point of making the entire system useless 
for mass adoption. For that reason, blockchain programmers are cur-
rently experimenting with a wide array of alternatives to the tradi-
tional “proof-of-work” technology characteristic of Bitcoin and other 
first-generation blockchains. For instance, blockchains which restrict 
access to the corroboration process to a few nodes within the network 
deemed particularly trustworthy (as in “proof-of-stake”-procedures) 
tend to centralize power again and thus reduce the moral benefits ger-
mane to decentralization. Another road is taken by proponents of a 
“proof of cooperation” that organizes the validation process by a coop-
erative system of “certified validation nodes”, for example in the case 
of “faircoin” (Wüstholz, 2018). It is unclear which of these approaches 
will carry the day and so we must leave it to future publications to 
tease out their respective ethical characteristics.


In a similar vein, the jury is still out on DAG technology which is no 
longer establishing a single chain of data blocks. Unlike a chain wherein 
one link follows the previous, DAG produces something more akin to a 
thick rope of data woven out of a large number of partly independent, 
partly intersecting threads of data. As a result, responsibility over the 
content of the ledger(s) is segmented, and for each given segment the 
community of corroborating witnesses may shrink to a small number of 
nodes—which speeds up the system but makes it also more vulnerable 
to attack or error. While a detailed analysis of the ethical implications of 
this technological alternative cannot be accomplished within the scope 
of this paper, it does provide an attractive avenue for future research.


7  | OUTCOMES FOR BUSINESS ETHIC S


The novelty of the blockchain technology of decentralized distrib-
uted ledgers poses the question how to deal with the technology 
practically. Given the highly ambivalent outcomes and yet-to-be as-
sessed ethical implications, we propose a two-pronged approach for 
decision makers in business and policy.


7.1 | Legal and ethical issues of transition


The potential of the blockchain technology to disrupt existing busi-
ness models and impact on the role of intermediaries or previous 
levels of transparency has been elaborated above. Like kindred 


innovations, blockchain technology challenges the existing legal 
framework and poses new ethical questions. Take the most visible 
example currently, for instance, the proposal of a cryptocurrency, 
that is, Libra, to be launched by social media giant Facebook (in col-
laboration with several other business partners and civil society 
organizations). Libra might challenge the global financial system by 
undermining the existing (albeit far from flawless) monetary system. 
Hence the pushback Libra is currently facing from G20 states. This 
case can stand as pars pro toto for blockchain-based applications 
overall and the need for a reliable legal framework for them. Similar to 
the legal harmonization of CSR standards (Gatti, Vishwanath, Cottier, 
& Seele, 2018) and reporting guidelines (Wagner & Seele, 2017), such 
a regulatory framework for blockchain technology appears requisite 
to (re-)establish level playing field for both legal and natural persons 
to compete without generating undue negative externalities.


7.2 | Open data deliberation and the (political) 
role of blockchain


We propose to understand blockchain through the lens of Habermasian 
or Political CSR. Building on the political philosophy of Habermas, spe-
cifically discourse ethics and deliberative democracy, business ethics 
scholars have ascribed a political role to corporations characterized by 
a responsibility to engage in open discourse, to allow for societal par-
ticipation and to contribute to the closing of regulatory gaps. What is 
well established in general management and business ethics (Scherer 
& Palazzo, 2011), already has been adopted for the field of digitali-
zation, leading to the concept of “data deliberation” (Schultz & Seele, 
2019), where private firms, governments, and other stakeholders join 
forces to increase public goods and encounter challenges such as 
environmental system risks. For blockchain technology, in particular 
with a view to improved transparency in supply chain management, 
something similar might hold. If blockchain technology is used, as de-
scribed above, in support of a more open digital environment, it may 
well boost forms of responsible digitalization, since the specifics of 
distributed ledger registries allow for better structured data, not in 
the least when it comes to open access solutions. Not incidentally, in 
literature on “distributed autonomous organizations”, a theoretical link 
to Habermasian arguments as well as their practical implications have 
already been established (van den Hoven et al., 2019).


The following Table 1 summarizes in a 3 × 3 Matrix for each cat-
egory (unfavorable, favorable, and ambivalent) examples from the 
reviewed applications plus offers guidance from a business ethics 
perspective, on how to reduce the respective ethical ambivalence 
when applying the two dimensions (regulation and transparency/
data deliberation) from this section.


8  | CONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK


As serious as the detractions of a nefarious use (see Section 4) of 
blockchain technology are—requiring global regulation—, they 






     |  357DIERKSMEIER anD SEELE


should not distract from the enormous potentials of this technol-
ogy to be employed on behalf of the common good (Section 5). Yet 
the most urgent need for further research is in the wide ambit of 
ambivalent aspects of blockchain technology (Section 6). Our pre-
liminary inspection how different ethical schools might conceptual-
ize such cases underscores that the phenomenon deserves further 
study by business ethicists. Future research, in our view, ought to 
address particularly the following questions, sequenced here from a 
micro-meso-macro-global perspective:


• How much transparency is too much? When does an increase in 
transparency no longer help but hinder the development and ex-
ecution of morality on a personal level?


• Can investments into the blockchain-based management of lux-
ury goods and their supply chains be trailblazers for the CSR-
oriented monitoring of a broader array of commodities?


• How can blockchain-based business models alleviate the situation 
at the base of the pyramid?


• May or should private firms try to build public goods such as 
worldwide payment systems like Libra?


• When is ID tracking ethically advantageous and in which scenar-
ios (refugees, dissidents, government surveillance in totalitarian 
states) does it create a moral hazard?


• How and at which level (local, regional, national, global) of gov-
ernance can the negative externalities of blockchain technology 
best be regulated?


These questions as well as the examples of ethically sensitive 
blockchain applications discussed above underscore the main thesis 
of this paper about the acute relevance and the timeliness of further 
research in the field.


In all, we see cause for cautionary optimism. The chances that 
this decentralized technology offers for more dispersed ways of cor-
porate ownership and for more democratic ways of governance are 
notable and should, in our eyes, be seized upon by practitioners as 
well as by theoreticians.
