In recent times, Supply chains are required to undergo the structural changes in order to adapt to the positive 
events such as Industry 4.0 and negative events such as natural and man-made disasters. Both positive and 
negative events tend to cause disruptions and affect business operations continuity. Supplier selection, being the 
critical and foremost activity must ensure that selected suppliers are capable of supporting the organizations 
against disruptions caused by these events. Hence, supplier selection and order allocation must be restructured 
considering the dynamics of Industry 4.0 and disaster events to ensure undisrupted flow of materials across 
supply chain. The paper proposes a multi stage hybrid model for integrated supplier segmentation, selection and 
order allocation considering risks and disruptions. The suppliers are then evaluated based on set of criteria 
suitable in Industry 4.0 environment using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and are further prioritized using 
Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution 
(FAHP-TOPSIS). The risk associated with each supplier is computed. The paper also proposes a Mixed Integer 
Program (MIP) as to optimize multi-period, multi item order allocation to suppliers in such a way that overall 
cost and risk of disruption is simultaneously minimized. In event of any disruption either from supply or demand 
side, the multi-stage hybrid model tends to reduce its economic impact by allocating emergency orders, thus, 
ensuring business operations continuity. The proposed multi-stage hybrid model is illustrated using a case of an 
automobile company.   


1. Introduction 


The fourth industrial revolution-Industry 4.0 has led to a significant 
change in every business function not just manufacturing. The business 
organizations are in the process of re-structuring their supply chains 
using the three main components of Industry 4.0: cyber-physical sys-
tems, Internet of things and smart factories to meet highly volatile and 
uncertain demand (Ghadimi et al., 2019). The disruptive technologies 
must be embedded into the entire supply chain structural design (Dolgui 
et al., 2018; Tjahjono et al., 2017) because an organization cannot truly 
benefit from disruptive technologies if its other supply chain partners 
are still functioning in conventional ways. In addition to disruptive 
technologies, ensuring business continuity in the event of disaster is also 
an equally important concern for the global and complex supply chains. 
The natural and manmade disasters lead to supply shortages and dis-
ruptions across supply chains (Sheffi, 2001, 2015) and supply chains 
must be re-structured in order to avoid the potential risks of disruptions 


as a part of their disaster preparedness (Wunnava, 2011; Sahebjamnia 
et al., 2015). Both the industrial revolution (positive events) and natural 
and manmade disasters (negative events) can cause disruptions if supply 
chains are not continuously adapted or aligned towards them. The 
disruption is the temporary or permanent loss in business functionality 
due to any unprecedented event (Tierney, 2007). Therefore, there is a 
need of supply chain structural design changes to protect against the risk 
of technological advancements as well as disruptions caused by 
disasters. 


Suppliers plays a vital role in efficient functioning of entire supply 
chain. The organizations evolving into Industry 4.0 may not successfully 
realize the benefits of Industry 4.0 (such as transparency, visualization 
and automation) if the suppliers are still functioning in the conventional 
manner. The supplier base much be technically as well as technologi-
cally competent to match the requirements of an interconnected value 
chain (Müller, 2019). The process of selecting the supplier base and 
allocation of the final orders must be re-structured to incorporate the

potential challenges caused by disruptive technologies as well as the 
disruption risks caused by disasters (Bhutta and Huq, 2002; Ivanov and 
Sokolov, 2012). In addition, the suppliers must be selected based upon 
their potential ability to support the organization during any crisis or 
disaster (Parmar et al., 2010). Hence, the supplier selection process must 
also consider the supplier’s resilience or ability to mitigate risks. The 
research frameworks for resilient supplier selection proposed in litera-
ture are mostly proactive in nature (Torabi et al., 2015; Haldar et al., 
2014). However, the occurrence of disaster is inevitable and it can 
disturb the entire supply chain dynamics if not handled efficiently. 
Therefore, process of supplier selection and order allocation must also be 
adaptive in nature and be able to minimize the impact of disruptions 
from propagating downstream. 


In view of this, the paper proposes a multi-stage hybrid model for 
structural design of supplier selection and order allocation in presence of 
disruptive technologies and disruption risks. The entire structure of 
supplier selection and order allocation process is redesigned starting 
from criteria definition to final order allocations. The technological 
criteria for supplier selection in identified and evaluated using Fuzzy 
AHP in order to match the dynamics of Industry 4.0 as well as the 
growing need of business resilience. The suppliers are segmented using 
the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) as efficient and inefficient sup-
pliers based on their performance on the set of criteria. The inefficient 
suppliers are not considered for further evaluation and order allocations. 
The efficient set of suppliers is further evaluated and prioritized using 
Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). 
The paper proposes the method to compute the average risk percentage 
for each supplier which is associated with each supplier. Finally, the 
paper proposes a Mixed Integer Program (MIP) considering disruption 
risk in Industry 4.0 environment and allocates the orders to the suppliers 
for multiple items over a multi period planning horizon such that total 
cost of procurement and risk associated can be minimized. The proposed 
MIP is further extended to model the demand and supply side disruption 
scenarios and emergency order allocation to optimize the overall cost 
and risk. The proposed multi-stage hybrid model is demonstrated using a 
case illustration of an automobile company where supplier selection 
process in being upgraded to address the dynamics of disruptive tech-
nologies and disaster caused disruptions. The findings of the study 
suggest that proactive segmentation and selection of suppliers to reduce 
the risk of disruption can actually support an organization to handle 
actual disruption scenarios to minimize the cost impact of disruptions 
and ensure the continuity of business operations. However, it has also 
been observed that in case of disaster, when demand unexpectedly 
fluctuates or supplier capacity is disrupted, the regular orders may not 
meet the demand. Therefore, the extended MIP proposed in paper at-
tempts to ensure business continuity by allocating emergency orders in 
cost efficient manner. The research attempts to highlight the role of 
supplier’s technological capabilities in the business resilience and 
ensuring business operations continuity. 


The rest of the paper as structured as follows. Section 2 presents the 
review of literature. Section 3 discusses the problem statement and the 
proposed multi-stage hybrid model. Section 4 demonstrates the pro-
posed model with the help of a case illustration. Section 5 discuss the 
managerial implications and theoretical contributions of the paper.

2. Literature review 


This section reviews the literature on supplier selection problem. 
Section 2.1 reviews the supply chain models considering disruption 
risks, Section 2.2 reviews the supply chain models from Industry 4.0 
perspective and Section 2.3 studies the supplier selection models under 
disruptive technologies and disruption risks. Section 2.4 identifies 
research gaps and research objectives are framed. 


2.1. Supply chain models under disruption risks 


In early 2000’s, it was realized that ability to manage supply chain 
disruptions can act as a competitive edge for any organization. (Sheffi 
and Rice, 2005). The researchers have also investigated the role of 
flexibility of supply chain structures in order to minimize the impact of 
disruptions. Skipper and Hanna (2009) have identified the attributes 
helpful in contingency planning contributing to the organizational 
flexibility in order to minimize the risk exposure. Wu et al. (2007) have 
proposed a disruption propagation framework to assess the disrupted 
functions of a supply chain and effect of these disruptions on perfor-
mance measures. 


The risk management is an important concern in supply chains as 
organizations must not select the supply chain partners which increase 
any kind of risk for them. Barroso et al. (2010) have identified the 
sources of supply chain disruptions and have discussed the strategies to 
manage the disruptions and achieve resilience across supply chain. 
Colicchia et al. (2010) have proposed a simulation-based framework for 
inbound supply chain risk management in a global sourcing context. 
Schmitt and Singh (2012) suggested that in order to capture disruption 
risks the supply chain networks must be considered as a whole and 
strategic inventory placement and backup capacity throughout several 
supply chain links must be used for mitigating the risks. Zhu (2013) have 
proposed joint replenishment and production model under un-
certainties. Backordering is allowed for higher and unfulfilled demand 
in order to mitigate disruption. However, the occurrence of any disaster 
is an inevitable event, and can affect any organization. Therefore, the 
supply chains must respond to the disruptions in order to avoid their 
propagation to other supply chain functions. Ivanov et al. (2014) have 
studied the phenomenon of ripple effect caused by supply chain dis-
ruptions and have compared its characteristics to bullwhip effect. Kim 
et al. (2015) have studied the supply chain network disruptions and the 
structural relationships among entities in the network. Any disruption in 
any node or arc may or may not disrupt entire supply chain network 
depending upon its structural relationships with other entities. This 
concept can be used for managing level of resilience in supply chain 
networks. Dubey et al. (2015) have proposed a multi objective mixed 
integer linear program considering uncertainties and have compared the 
results using several numerical experiments to study the effect on supply 
chain resilience. Gupta et al. (2015) have analysed the classic dilemma 
or single vs dual sourcing in presence of possible disruption risks. Dubey 
et al. (2017) have investigated the role of behavioural dimensions such 
as trust and cooperation on supply chain resilience. Khalili et al. (2017) 
have suggested the integrated production and sourcing planning 
considering extra capacities of production facilities, prepositioning or 
inventories and backup logistics are some structural changes suggested 
to improve supply chain resilience. Ivanov and Dolgui (2018) have 
suggested the need to develop resilient as well as efficient supply chain 
design. The low certainty need supply chains can be developed by 
incorporating more flexibility in process and resource utilization. Altay 
et al. (2018) have conducted an empirical study exploring the effect of 
the resilience and agility efforts of business organizations on the 
pre-disaster and post-disaster supply chain performance. Hosseini et al. 
(2019a) have conducted a systematic review of literature and studied 
the mathematical/quantitative models developed for supply chain 
resilience. Ivanov et al. (2019a) have studied that how digitization of 
supply chains can help in managing disruption risk and ripple effect 
mitigation by coordinating material and information flow between 
cyber and physical supply chains. Ivanov et al. (2019b) have studied in 
their book that how one failure propagates through supply chain 
structures and what supply chain structures are prone to ripple effect 
and have explored the mitigation strategies. Ivanov (2018) have 
explained the concepts of resilience along with structural dynamics. The 
methodologies and models for recovery and stabilization of supply chain 
structures are also proposed.

2.2. Supply chain models considering disruptive technologies 


The new technologies can also disrupt the way business organiza-
tions functions and the supply chains must be re-structured from time to 
time in order to keep up with changing dynamics. Fawcett et al. (2011) 
have studied why information sharing among several supply chain 
functions is not improved despite the infrastructure and have suggested 
changes required to improve the same. Prajogo and Sohal (2013) have 
studied the competencies and skills required by supply chain managers 
for the changes expected in supply chain functions due to adoption of 
technology and automation. Schr€oder et al. (2014) is one of the initial 
papers mentioning the need of transitioning in supply chain required for 
Industry 4.0. The change in risk management system and the new po-
tential risks that supply chains are likely to encounter in Industry 4.0 are 
also studied in literature. Brettel et al. (2014) have studied and identi-
fied the major areas from the supply chain which needs to be developed 
and supported for fourth industrial revolution. Parre~no-Marchante et al. 
(2014) have proposed a system architecture using RFID to enhance 
flexibility and traceability in supply chain. Khajavi et al. (2014) have 
investigated the impact of additive manufacturing in case of distributed 
production scenario and have identified major challenged in its adop-
tion by the industry. Mohr and Khan (2015) have suggested the use of 
flexible structural changes in supply chain to take advantage of 3D 
printing. Gnimpieba et al. (2015) have proposed an architecture for 
collaborative supply chain structure. With manufacturing industries 
gradually transitioning into Industry 4.0, it has been realized that 
several supply chain functions must also be upgraded from an Industry 
4.0 perspective. Schlüter et al. (2016) have proposed a risk mitigation 
framework for decentralized supply chain networks by considering In-
dustry 4.0 factors and finance indicators. Ivanov et al. (2018) have also 
proposed a risk mitigation research framework to control ripple effect in 
a cyber-physical systems-based supply chain. Duarte and Cruz-Machado 
(2017) have identified the gaps in incorporating lean and green supply 
chain characteristics in Industry 4.0. Gamage and Rupasinghe (2017) 
have simulated the impact of Industry 4.0 applications such as infor-
mation sharing, prediction, resource allocation & cross functionality of 
the impact of sustainability in carbon emissions of an apparel industry. 


In context of factories in industries, Ivanov et al. (2016) have pro-
posed an integrated model for machine selection and job assignment for 
dynamic short-term scheduling for Industry 4.0. Stentoft and Rajkumar 
(2018) have studied the reorganization of manufacturing structures due 
to technological advancements leading to back-shoring or re-shoring. 
Barreto et al. (2017) have explored the effect of Industry 4.0 in distri-
bution networks. Logistics domain is undergoing several technological 
changes involving a lot of sensor technologies and automation. Hence, 
the managerial requirements for efficient operation of logistics domain 
for Industry 4.0 are identified. Tjahjono et al. (2017) have studied 
several domains within supply chain such as procurement, logistics etc. 
and have identified the key performance indicators affected by the 
disruptive technologies. Hoffman and Rusch (2017) have explored that 
how logistics sector can be developed to the support industries of the 
fourth revolution. Barata et al. (2018) have reviewed the work done for 
supply chains in Industry 4.0 in order to identify emerging research 
areas. Stentoft and Rajkumar (2018) have investigated how the in-
novations in supply chain functions affect the market and operational 
performance of an organization. Panetto et al. (2019) have identified the 
technology enabled strategies and challenges faced by these strategies in 
design of innovative and resilient networks. Dubey et al. (2019) have 
investigated the relationship between data analytics, supply chain 
resilience, organizational flexibility and competitive advantage. Ardito 
et al. (2019) have studied the digitization of supply chain functions in 
order to provide an interface between supply chain and marketing 
functions. 


2.3. Supplier selection models under disruption risks and disruptive 
technologies 


Suppliers have a vital role to play in ensuring business operations 
continuity. Efficient and reliable supplier base is an essential require-
ment in order to respond and recover from natural or man-made dis-
ruptions. Therefore, the sourcing practices carried out by an 
organization have an important role in ensuring the supply chain resil-
ience and an organization’s overall preparedness. In this direction, 
Tomlin (2006) studied several mitigation strategies for disruptions 
coming from supplier side and have compared them by proposing an 
ordering policy model considering volume flexibility. Yu et al. (2009) 
have conducted a comparative analysis between single and dual sourc-
ing methods considering disruption probability and profit. Parmar et al. 
(2010) have proposed an algorithm for effective supplier base man-
agement in order to minimize the supply side disruptions. Haldar et al. 
(2012, 2014) have proposed resilient supplier selection models using 
fuzzy MCDM methods. Supplier selection and order allocation is a core 
business function that requires continuous structural changes from time 
to time. Sawik (2013) proposed supplier portfolio selection model 
considering the risk of disruption and suggested the use of inventory 
pre-positioning with protected suppliers to mitigate the disruptions. 
Torabi et al. (2015) have proposed a supplier selection and order allo-
cation model considering several disruption scenarios. The total resil-
ience level can be calculated for various strategies considered. 
Kamalahmadi and Mellat-Parast (2016) have proposed a flexible 
sourcing model integrating supplier selection and transportation de-
cisions for resilience in supply chain. The study suggested that to reduce 
the disruption risk, sourcing must be done from a fewer, however, more 
resilient suppliers. Hosseini and Barker (2016) have proposed the 
resilience criteria to be used for supplier selection along with primary 
and sustainable criteria and have used Bayesian network model to study 
the causal relationship among criteria. Parkouhi and Ghadikolaei (2017) 
have proposed a fuzzy ANP- Grey VIKOR based model to evaluate the 
resilience of suppliers. The model is developed for a wood and paper 
industry. In recent times, supply failure risk as an important measure for 
supplier selection (Lee, 2017). Hosseini and Al Khaled (2019) have 
identified eight criteria contributing to supplier resilience and have 
proposed a regression and AHP based hybrid model for supplier selec-
tion. Hosseini and Ivanov (2019) and Hosseini et al. (2019b) have 
modelled the ripple effect in the supply chain by considering supplier 
disruption probability using Bayesian network approach considering 
different levels of supplier capacity and stages of disruptions. Hosseini 
et al. (2019c) have also proposed a model for resilient supplier selection 
by considering the probability of disruption of suppliers Valipour Par-
kouhi et al. (2019) have proposed joint supplier selection and segmen-
tation framework by identifying the resilient criteria and classifying 
them as enhancers or reducers. The grey DEMATEL and grey simple 
additive weight methodology has been used. It is not possible for any 
organization to realize the benefits of Industry 4.0 without technologi-
cally upgrading its end to end supply chain. Real-time information 
sharing and technical assistance among supply chain partners is the key 
feature of Industry 4.0. Therefore, supply chain partners must be 
selected to match the requirements of Industry 4.0 infrastructure. To 
address this concern, Müller (2019) have studied the challenges of 
supplier integration in Industry 4.0. The strategies of supplier integra-
tion are proposed by drawing insights from expert interviews. Recently, 
Ghadimi et al. (2019) have developed a multi-technology based archi-
tecture for automated supplier selection process. Cavalcantea et al. 
(2019) have proposed a simulation and machine learning based supplier 
selection considering risk profiles of suppliers in a digital manufacturing 
environment. The reviewed literature is summarized in Table 1.

2.4. Research gaps and research objective 


The supply chains are subjected to continuous transition owing to 
increased complexity, globalization, technological advancements and 
the risk of disruptions from natural and manmade disasters. The struc-
ture of supply chains cannot remain static anymore, it needs to go 
through continuous evolution and must be adaptive to both positive and 
negative events in the business environment. It is observed that most of 
the literature study the effect of disruptive technologies on the func-
tioning of an organization. However, the companies cannot work in 
isolation, therefore, the real value of these disruptive technologies 
cannot be realized if the changes are not adopted among all the supply 
chain. Moreover, most of the papers have considered one technology 
and its potential for supply chains. But, Industry 4.0 is driven by a set of 
technologies interacting with each other. There is very limited literature 
available on the study of structural changes required in entire supply 
chain design in order to adopt the disruptive technologies. Moreover, it 
is also realized that the literature on disruption risks and supply chain 
resilience is studied for the conventional supply chain structures. There 
is a very limited literature addressing on the managing the disruption 
risk for a highly digitized supply chain. The disruptions in supply side 
are minimized using resilient supplier selection. However, with the 
emerging disruptive technologies, there is a need to redesign the process 
of supplier selection and order allocation. The conventional criteria and 
methods used for supplier selection and handling the disruption risks 
may not do well in presence of disruptive technologies. In view of the 
gaps identified from literature following are the research questions 
(RQ): 


RQ1. What are the technological criteria for supplier selection in 
presence of disruption risks for Industry 4.0? 


RQ2. How to identify the most important criteria? 


RQ3. How to create a technologically competent supplier base? 


RQ4. How supplier risk can be computed?

3. Problem statement and proposed multi-stage hybrid model 


3.1. Problem statement 


The paper addresses the restructuring of the supplier selection and 
order allocation process of a global manufacturing company which is in 
process of transition into an Industry 4.0 and the company also intend to 
minimize the risk of disruptions due to any disaster event. Therefore, the 
suppliers must be selected in such a manner that they are technologically 
competent so that the company can realize the actual benefits of In-
dustry 4.0 and ensure the undisrupted flow of materials to its 
manufacturing facility in order to respond to the market demand. If any 
of the supply chain partner is not technologically competent, it acts as a 
source of risk and can lead to supply chain disruption. It is important for 
the company to restructure its supply chain networks so that the infor-
mation is shared across the channels on real-time basis to gain the 
flexibility and responsiveness required in Industry 4.0 environment. 
Therefore, the company needs to identify and evaluate the technology 
driven as well as resilient criteria and develop a supplier segmentation, 
selection and order allocation methodology jointly considering both 
disruptive technologies as well as disruption risks. The supplier selection 
and order allocation structure must be adaptive to absorb the real time 
demand fluctuations as well as unexpected disruptions such that total 
cost as well as risk can be simultaneously minimized considering de-
mand fluctuations, risk and disruptions. 


3.2. Research framework 


The research framework for the problem stated in section 3.1 is 
shown in Fig. 1. The initial step is to identify the set of technology driven 
criteria from an Industry 4.0 perspective for restructuring of supplier 
selection process. The identified criteria are then studied for their inter- 
relationship and are evaluated using expert opinions. The suppliers are 
initially segmented into the efficient and inefficient suppliers using data 
envelopment analysis (DEA). The motivation to use DEA is to reduce the 
supplier base before applying the more exhaustive method for supplier 
prioritization and risk calculation. The inefficient suppliers are, there-
fore, not considered for the further process selection and order alloca-
tion. The efficient suppliers further evaluated and prioritized using 
FAHP-TOPSIS. There are other multi criteria decision making tools 
which can be used for the supplier prioritization, however, TOPSIS is 
used because it is relatively less complicated and easy to understand 
(Roszkowska, 2011). The set of criteria for supplier selection is supposed 
to protect the organization against certain risks that can cause disrup-
tions in entire supply chain. Therefore, the criteria-risk mapping is done 
to understand how various criteria are protecting the organization 
against various risks. Using the ratings given to suppliers against various 
criteria in TOPSIS, the average risk percentage is calculated for each 
supplier. The MIP is proposed to optimize supplier selection and order 
allocation such that the demand is met with minimum cost (including 
cost of risk). However, due to any unforeseen/disaster event if any 
supplier is disrupted or the demand for any product suddenly fluctuates,

the system must be adaptive enough to handle this situation using 
emergency orders minimizing the total cost and stockouts. Therefore, 
the MIP is further extended for a disaster scenario, where supplier dis-
ruptions and unexpected demand fluctuations are considered and 
managed using emergency orders and backup capacities keeping the 
total cost of procurement, stockouts and risks at a minimal level. 


3.3. Identification of criteria & priorities 


The technologically driven criteria are identified using the review of 
literature and the field survey. The conventional set of criteria used in 
literature need to be revised to incorporate the technological re-
quirements expected from supplier’s side for industries investing into 
disruptive technologies. Moreover, the technological criteria must also 
ensure the undisrupted flow of information and materials even during 
the disasters. The priority of these criteria is established by conducting 
pairwise comparison among the criteria. As, the adoption of disruptive 
technologies is relatively new in industry, therefore, here is a there is a 
slight fuzziness in clarity about the inter-relationship among various 
technological criteria. Hence fuzzy-scale is used to capture these un-
certainties. The criteria weights are hence obtained using FAHP. The 
fuzzy scale used for FAHP can be referred from Appendix A1. The steps 


to convert fuzzy weights into crisp weights can be referred from Opri-
covic and Tzeng (2004). 


3.4. Supplier segmentation using DEA 


The suppliers are evaluated to be included in the pool of suppliers for 
the company. The suppliers are rated for their expected performance on 
the identified criteria (in section 4.1). The output-oriented DEA model is 
used for evaluation. The outputs of all the DMU’s are evaluated for a 
virtual output. Since, the ratings of the suppliers against all the criteria 
are their performance measure and hence are considered to be the 
output. The formulation of the model is given as follows: 


In any system, let’s assume that there are r outputs and i inputs, and 
ur is the weight if the output Yro for any particular DMU. Similarly, vi is 
weight of input Xij, then in order to have better performing units, total 
output should be maximized if input is fixed. The objective function is to 
maximize the total output as shown in equation (1). For detailed 
explanation, Lovell and Pastor (1999) can be referred.

The model is solved for each supplier one by one and the suppliers 
having efficiency 1 are considered in the pool, the inefficient suppliers 
are not considered. If an organization is keeping technologically ineffi-
cient suppliers in the pool, the chances of supply chain disruptions are 
more during any disaster event. Hence, as a proactive measure, it is 
important to carefully select technologically competent and compatible 
suppliers for transparency and responsiveness across the supply chain. 


3.5. Supplier prioritization using TOPSIS 


Supplier selection is followed by supplier segmentation. After the 
criteria are identified and suppliers are evaluated to be efficient or 
inefficient on these criteria, the final selection of suppliers need to be 
done. The efficient suppliers are only considered for further evaluation 
using TOPSIS. TOPSIS stands for technique for preference by similarity 
to the ideal solution is a multi-criteria decision-making method pro-
posed by Hwang and Yoon (1981) rank the set of alternatives. The steps 
involved in TOPSIS are described below: 


Step-I: Performance data is obtained for j alternatives over i criteria 
as shown in equation (5)

However, if all the criteria are equally weighted than it will be

By allocating orders to the most preferred or top ranked suppliers, 
the risk of supply chain disruption due to disasters for an Industry 4.0 
can be minimized. The company can also develop strategic alliance with 
the top-ranked suppliers to ensure the business continuity in the time of 
crises. Hence, this methodology is also used to identify suppliers worth 
to be further developed for collaborative projects. 


3.6. Criteria-risk mapping and supplier risk calculation 


The criteria used for supplier selection are supposed to protect the 
organization against one or more supply chain risks. Therefore, it is 
important to understand how the criteria used for supplier selection are 
linked to the supply chain risk. For the purpose of this study, the risk is 
classified into five types namely forecast risk, procurement risk, capacity 
risk, inventory risk and system’s risk. Each kind of risk is briefly defined 
below. Chopra and Sodhi (2004) can be referred for further explanation. 


Forecast risk: Mismatch between expected and actual demand 
within supply chain. Procurement risk: Unexpected fluctuation in cost, 
quality & time of delivered items due to supplier price hikes, improper 
contract conditions or any inefficiency at supplier’s end. 


Capacity risk: Risk of having excess or short capacity. 
Inventory risk: Holding of excess inventory throughout supply chain 


can affect the financial efficiency of the entire supply chain. 
System’s risk: In integrated cyber physical systems, any threat or 


failure anywhere in supply chain can affect entire supply chain. 
Step I: The criteria-risk matrix is prepared to identify which criteria 


is mitigating which risk. The matrix uses binary variable (Wki) which 
takes value 1 if criteria i is covering the risk k for the organization, 
otherwise it takes value 0. Hence The matrix W is shown below in 
equation (13): 


W ¼

Also compute the column sum ( 
P

wki; 8k) to determine how many 


total criteria are covering each kind of risk for the organization. 
Step II: The suppliers are rated against these criteria already for 


TOPSIS (equation (5)).

Step III: The risk of supplier noncompliance is calculated using these 
ratings. The risk percentage for non-compliance of each supplier against 
each criterion is computed with the help of following equation:

3.7. Mixed integer program for supplier selection & order allocation 
(With and Without disruptions) 


In this section, the mixed integer program is proposed for supplier 
selection and order allocation jointly considering the disruptive tech-
nologies and disruption risks. The model is proposed for multi-item and 
multi-period planning of order allocation to the suppliers. The orders 
can only be allocated to the efficient set of suppliers identified at 
screening stage. The prices and capacities offered by the suppliers are 
already known. The objective of the supplier selection and order allo-
cation is to ensure that demand is met with minimum total cost 
including the cost of risk. If there is no disaster, the regular orders must 
be released in such a manner that total cost and risk can be minimized. 
However, if there is a disaster scenario, the regular orders should remain 
as such and disruption must be handled using emergency orders to the 
same or different supplier. The assumptions and notations used in the 
model are described below: 


Assumptions for the model:  


1. Demand is stochastic in nature. However, the mean and variance 
tend to change before and after the disaster.  


2. Suppliers have limited capacity and known with certainty. In case, 
disaster occurs, suppliers can support with an additional 20% backup 
capacity  


3. All orders must be fulfilled in same period. Late deliveries are not 
allowed. Penalty cost is incurred for any shortages in case of disaster 
caused disruptions.  


4. Emergency orders can be executed to prevent the disruptions.

The objective function of the model shown equation (19) is the 
minimization of total cost of procurement comprising of unit price, 
ordering cost, transportation and holding cost along with the total risk 
coming from selected suppliers over the entire planning horizon. 
Equation (20) represents the inventory balance equation balancing in-
ventory from previous period and total orders received to the demand 
and inventory left over in current period. Equation (21) restricts the 
maximum order to be placed in any period to the total demand over 
planning period. Equation (22) is the supplier capacity constraint 
restricting the order quantity with the available supplier capacity. 
Equation (23) restricts the maximum risk coming from suppliers for any 
product in any period to be less than 40%. The integer nature of order 
quantity Xpstand inventory Iptand the binary nature of variable Ypstfor 
supplier selection is shown in equations (24) and (25) respectively. 


Extended MIP: Supplier Selection and Order Allocation with 
disruptions. 


If any disaster event occurs model II is used to execute emergency 
orders from the selected or backup suppliers. The purchase price of 
emergency orders is higher than regular orders. The emergency orders 
from suppliers are also associated with risk. In model II shortages can 
occur and a penalty cost is incurred corresponding to the same. The 
regular orders already finalized using model I must remain as such and 
can be used as given data in Model II. The model is formulated as 
following:

Equation (26) represents the objective function of the model which 
minimizes the total cost of procurement comprising of purchase price, 
ordering cost, transportation cost of regular as well as emergency orders, 
holding cost, penalty cost for the shortages occurring, and the cost of risk 
from regular orders and emergency orders. Equation (27) represents the 
inventory balance equation, balancing the inventory on hand, the reg-
ular orders and the emergency orders to the demand, current inventory 
and the shortages. Equation (28) is the capacity constraint for emer-
gency orders. During any disaster event, the suppliers offer 20% more 
capacity as extended support. Emergency orders can be placed from the 
same supplier as regular orders or the different one. The risk for each 
product in each time period for extended orders should be less than 30% 
as shown in equation (29). Equation (30) describes the integer nature of 
emergency orders and shortages and equation (31) describes the binary 
nature of variable for supplier selection for emergency orders. 


4. Case illustration: XYZ automobiles private limited 


In this section, the proposed multi stage hybrid model for supplier 
selection and order allocation is illustrated using the case of XYZ Au-
tomobiles Pvt. Ltd. XYZ has been a market leader in automobiles for 
several years despite encountering some disruptions from time to time. 
In recent years, the company has been investing heavily in disruptive 
technologies and hence bringing in major structural changes in its 
overall functioning. XYZ has realized that it has not been able to gain 
any significant improvement as the technologies under the umbrella of 
Industry 4.0 has been installed and implemented at a company’s level. 
The other supply chain functions of the company are not yet fully in-
tegrated with the technologies available within the company. Therefore, 
the company has not been able to realize the potential benefits of In-
dustry 4.0 like supply chain visibility and transparency. Supplier se-
lection and order allocation is one key function for the company which 
needs structural transformation. The company has been using the 


conventional criteria and methods for supplier evaluation and therefore, 
are not able to capture the technological competency of suppliers which 
is now an important requirement by the company. The other major 
concern for the company to integrate the supply chain is to minimize the 
disruptions which are caused by the natural disasters such as floods, 
cyclones & earthquakes as well as manmade disasters such as terrorist 
attacks or protests. Hence, the company is required to identify and up-
date the supplier evaluation criteria capturing the technological com-
petency of the suppliers. The suppliers which are not technologically 
competent may not provide the necessary visibility to the company in 
terms of capacity and lead-times, increasing the risk of disruption and 
hence cannot be considered for order allocations. The company is 
required to maintain and develop a pool of suppliers based on the 
technological criteria to ensure the efficient use of disruptive technol-
ogies in order to fulfil the uncertain demand and to handle disaster 
caused disruptions. The disaster events in past have caused two types of 
disruptions for the company in the past i.e. huge fluctuation in demand 
and/or capacity failure from supplier side. The company needs to design 
a supplier segmentation, selection and order allocation process such that 
the suppliers suitable to adapt to the changes in technology ongoing 
with the company are identified and developed and can also help the 
company in handling the sudden fluctuations in demand/capacity due to 
disasters by providing real time visibility. The company intends to 
develop the supplier segmentation & selection process so that overall 
cost of procuring items over a planning horizon can be minimized. At the 
same time, the supplier selection process is expected to be adaptive to 
handle the potential disruption by allocating emergency orders to other 
suppliers such that cost impact and risk is kept minimum. In order to 
address the company’s concerns the multi-stage hybrid model for sup-
plier selection and order allocation considering disruptive technologies 
and disruption risks is implemented. The steps are explained in 
following subsections. 


4.1. Criteria identification & prioritization 


The criteria for evaluating suppliers for their technological compe-
tence are identified from literature and from expert opinion (top & 
middle management of the company). The identified criteria are briefly 
described in Table 2. The criteria are compared amongst themselves 
using Fuzzy-AHP. The aggregated fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix is 
provided in Appendix A2. Final priorities of the criteria are shown in 
Table 3. It has been observed that manufacturing flexibility, cyber se-
curity, use of RFID & data visibility are important technological re-
quirements from the suppliers in today’s digitized supply chains. The

accordingly 


C2 RFID/Barcodes It helps in visualizing the levels of inventory at all levels of supply chains, having real time information can help the organization to 
manage disruptions from alternate/backup suppliers 


C3 Public-Private Partnership Public-private partnerships can help in data access from government agencies and organizations can know the actual impact of 
disaster 


C4 Smart contracts using Block chain Can help manage the capital and resources and maintains a transparency at all supply chain links 
C5 Data Visibility across value chain Each supply chain link must be also to provide all necessary information on real time basis to other supply chain partners to prevent 


any chance to disruption

technological criteria are used for supplier selection process in order to 
adapt to the changing supply chain dynamics and to mitigate the risk of 
disruption by natural and man-made disasters. 


4.2. Supplier segmentation 


In supplier segmentation process, the initial pool of suppliers is 
evaluated against the identified set of criteria using Output-oriented 
DEA model. The rating of each supplier’s potential to perform on the 
given criteria is taken from the historic data as well as from expert’s 
judgements. All ratings measure supplier’s performance on given 
criteria, therefore, are considered to be the output. The suppliers are 
then segmented into efficient and inefficient ones. After using the model 
for all the suppliers, the efficiencies calculated are shown in Table 4. 


Hence, efficient supplier set is {S2, S3, S4, S7, S8} is considered for 
further selection process whereas the inefficient set of suppliers {S1, S5, 
S6, S9, S10} are not further considered. By dropping the inefficient sup-
pliers unable to adapt to the dynamics caused by the use of disruptive 
technologies in supply chain, the risk of disruption likely to be caused by 
inefficient suppliers can be avoided. 


4.3. Supplier prioritization using TOPSIS 


After supplier segmentation, the efficient set of suppliers are 
considered for further procedures, whereas the inefficient suppliers are 
dropped. The efficient suppliers are further prioritized using TOPSIS. 
Appendix A3 shows the detailed steps of the TOPSIS for given data. The 
weights used in TOPSIS for criteria have already been computed using 
FAHP. Finally, using FAHP-TOPSIS, the final closeness index is 
computed and the suppliers are ranked as shown in Table 5. The supplier 
S4 is found to be best ranked followed by S7. Supplier S3 is ranked third 
followed by S8 and S2. 


4.4. Criteria-risk mapping and supplier risk calculation 


The criteria used for supplier selection are supposed to protect the 
company against one of the supply chain risks. The criteria-risk mapping 
is done using expert opinions and the insights drawn from literature. In 
Table 6, the criteria-risk matrix is shown indicating which criteria is 
protecting the organization against which risk. For example: the for 
criteria C1 the value is 1 against forecasting risk, indicating that criteria 
C1 is protecting the organization against that particular risk. If the value 
of cell is zero, it indicates no relationship. 


Using the steps describes in section 3.6, The average risk associated 


with each supplier is calculated. It can be observed from Table 7 that 
supplier S3 is having least risk associated with it which is 18% and 
supplier S2 is having highest risk percentage out of all five suppliers. 


4.5. Supplier selection and order allocation using MIP 


The multi-period and multi-product planning of detailed order al-
locations to respective suppliers has to be done by the company. The 
problem considers the order allocation problem for ten different items to 
the five suppliers over a planning horizon of six months. The orders must 
be allocated to the suppliers in such a way that demand is fully met at 
minimum cost of procurement including the purchase cost, ordering 
cost, transportation cost, holding and risk cost. The supplier capacities, 
prices offered by suppliers and the forecast of mean and deviation for 
stochastic demand are known to the company. The complete data for the 
problem is given in Appendix A4. The problem is solved using mixed 
integer program when there is no disaster/unforeseen event. The com-
plete supplier selection and order allocation obtained for the given 
problem in absence of any disruption is provided in Table 8. It can be 
noted that at this stage all the orders are the regular orders. The total 
cost of procurement is 3002984. It can be seen from the table that dy-
namic lot sizing is followed for all the products to match the stochastic 
demand. 


4.5.1. Disaster scenario I: demand fluctuations 
Now, considering a scenario when there is a disaster occurrence in 


second time period. Due to disaster, there is a fluctuation in demand of 
all the parts from second period onwards. In this case regular orders 
alone will not be able to satisfy the increased demand. In this case, the 
problem is again solved using extended MIP, which considers regular 
orders as input and minimizes the disruptions by allocating emergency 
orders over and above the regular orders. It is assumed that in case of 
disaster all suppliers are bound to offer 20% more capacity than they 
were offering initially. If demand is still not met using emergency orders 
it will result in a stockout for which company incur the huge cost of 
stockout. The price for emergency orders charged by the suppliers is also 
higher than the price for regular orders. It can be seen from Fig. 2 that 
demand has increased from time period 2 onwards and the emergency 
order are allocated in addition to regular orders. The regular demand is 
shown using the solid line and fluctuated demand is shown using the 
dotted line. The regular orders and emergency orders are shown using 
bars. It can also be seen from Fig. 2 that in most of the cases the emer-
gency orders are given to the suppliers already given regular orders. It is 
because it is more cost effective to order in emergency situations from 
same supplier already supplying the regular orders. However, in some 
cases, due to cost or capacity restrictions the emergency orders are given 
to other suppliers as well. The total cost incurred in this case is 3267580 
including the incremental cost of managing disruption. In this case, the 
increased demand is fully met using emergency orders and hence no 
shortage cost is incurred. However, if the demand fluctuations are not

managed using emergency orders, it would have resulted in shortages/ 
disruption. It would have cost the company 1390900, which is 54% 
higher than cost of regular orders. On the other hand, the cost of man-
aging disruptions using incremental orders is merely 9% of regular cost. 
The ordering patterns for each product time over entire planning hori-
zon with or without disaster occurrence are also shown in Appendix A5. 


4.5.2. Disaster scenario II: capacity disruption 
In this section, another disaster scenario is considered where the 


supplier capacity of one of the supplier’s is disrupted. In this case, 
disaster does not affect the demand, however, the capacity of supplier 2 
is disrupted. It is assumed that disaster occurred in time period 2, 
therefore supplier 2 would not be able to fulfil its regular orders from 
period 2 onwards. Therefore, in this scenario, the extended MIP is again 
used to allocate emergency orders for the disruption caused. In this case, 
the regular orders for supplier 2 will become zero from second period 
onwards. The results obtained are shown in Fig. 3. It is observed from 
the figure that corresponding to demand, the regular and emergency 
orders placed. The incremental cost of procurement is incurred for 
emergency orders. The ordering pattern for all the items over entire 
planning horizon for regular and emergency orders is tabulated in detain 
in Appendix A6. It is estimated that total cost of procurement including 
the cost of emergency orders for this scenario is 3269683. However, in 
case this disruption in supplier capacity cannot be managed using 
emergency order allocation to other suppliers, it all would have resulted 
in shortages. And the total penalty cost for shortages would amount to 
4423800, which is 47% more than total cost of procurement (see Fig. 4). 


4.5.3. Disaster scenario III: demand fluctuation and capacity disruption 
(Exhibit A) 


In third scenario, it is assumed that disaster has two-fold effect, it 
caused demand fluctuations in addition to the capacity disruption. In 
this scenario, it is considered that both scenario I and scenario have 
occurred together. There is a demand fluctuation due to disaster and also 
there is a capacity disruption from supplier side. Again, it is assumed 
that disaster occurs in period 2, the demand for all the products fluc-
tuates from period 2 onwards. Also, the supplier 2 is disrupted from 
period 2 onwards and will not be able to fulfil the regular orders allo-
cated for all the parts. In order to manage both the disruptions, the 
extended MIP is used. The regular orders are kept as it is, however, the 
regular orders pertaining to the disrupted supplier (S2) will become zero 


from second period onwards. The emergency orders are allocated to the 
suppliers with remaining & extended capacity in order to manage the 
regular orders which supplier S2 was unable to meet and also to meet the 
demand fluctuations as much as possible. The results obtained are 
shown in Fig. 5. It can be seen that the demand has increased during 
disaster as well as regular orders have reduced due to disruption. 
Therefore, in this case the quantity and number of emergency orders 
have significantly increased as compared to other orders. The ordering 
pattern for all the products over the planning horizon is provided in 
Appendix A7. In case, there is not enough backup capacity to handle 
disruptions, it can result in shortages. For this case example, no short-
ages are incurred. The total cost of procurement incurred for this sce-
nario is 3565577. However, if these disruptions were not handled using 
emergency orders, they would have resulted in shortages and cost of 
penalty would be 5840480 which is 94% higher than the total cost of 
procurement in this case. 


4.5.4. Disaster scenario IV: demand fluctuation and capacity disruption 
(Exhibit B) 


In the fourth scenario, it is assumed that the disaster leads to both the 
demand and supply disruptions simultaneously. This scenario is similar 
to scenario III, however, the intensity of the disruption varies in this 
case. It is assumed that disaster event has led to unexpectedly high de-
mand fluctuations and on the other side some suppliers are affected by 
the disaster leading to complete capacity loss by those suppliers. The 
initial supplier selection and order allocation. 


Again, it is assumed that disaster occurs in time period T2, the de-
mand for all the products experiences huge fluctuations from time 
period T2 onwards. The suppliers S2 and S8 are also disrupted which 
means that they will not be able to fulfil any regular orders for any item 
product allocated to them. The extended MIP is used to manage the 
disruptions and revise the regular orders to meet the demand which may 
have increased significantly due to disaster and allocate emergency or-
ders to undisrupted suppliers in case in case some of the suppliers are 
disrupted. Now in this case, the company will be able to manage dis-
ruptions on the real time basis only if the supplier base is technologically 
competent to share the effect of disruptions with the company and al-
lows the revision of regular orders. In order to achieve the real-time 
coordination between suppliers and buyers is only possible if real-time 
information sharing is there between two parties. Therefore, in order 
to minimize the impact of disruptions, the suppliers must be

technologically competent with the firm transitioning inti Industry 4.0. 
The results of the extended MIP suggest that all the regular orders 


except the orders pertaining to the disrupted suppliers (S2 & S8) will 
become zero from second time period onwards. The emergency orders 
are allocated to the remaining undisrupted suppliers by utilizing their 
remaining or extended capacity available such that the demand is met as 
much as possible and the shortages are minimized. The results obtained 
are charted in Fig. 5. In this case, due to the huge fluctuation in the 
demand and two suppliers being disrupted, the high amount of emer-
gency orders allocated to the rest of the suppliers. The detailed ordering 
plan and the emergency order allocations are provided in Appendix A8. 
The company is able to handle the disruptions and allocate emergency 
orders because of real time information sharing and transparency be-
tween the company and the suppliers in Industry 4.0 environment. In 
this case the total cost of the procurement is 3887198. However, if this 
information sharing is not there, it can result in shortages. For this case 
example, no shortages are incurred. However, if these disruptions were 
not handled using emergency orders, they would have resulted in 
shortages and cost of penalty would be 5840200 which is 1844% higher 
than the total cost of procurement in this case. 


Table 9 shows that some flexibility in supply chain structure can help 
the company in preventing the disruptions by allocating emergency 
orders to other suppliers. It can be seen from the table that cost of 
procurement including the emergency orders is significantly less than 
the penalty cost for shortages for all the disaster scenarios. It is also 
realized from this case example that careful selection of suppliers in this 
era of disruptive technologies is extremely important. In this case, the 
suppliers are technologically competent to the organization and hence 
the information sharing and flow of material is transparent. The supplier 
capacity is visible to the organization and hence the emergency orders 
can be placed. In absence of technologically competent suppliers, such 
responsiveness and flexibility cannot be achieved. Therefore, disruptive 
technologies play a significant role in managing disruption risks in a 
supply chain. This case also indicates the importance of supplier-buyer 


relationships along with the role of information sharing across supply 
chain. The demand fluctuations in this case can be managed using 
supplier backup capacity during disaster. 


5. Managerial implications and theoretical contributions 


5.1. Managerial implications 


The outcomes of the proposed research can help supply chain man-
agers to reconfigure their conventional supplier selection and order 
allocation process to match the changing dynamics of the industry. The 
proposed framework can be used as a decision making tool by the 
business organization which can assist supply chain managers in eval-
uation of supplier alternatives on their technological capabilities as well 
as their ability to ensure business continuity against disruptions from 
disasters. The findings reveals that the supplier segmentation and pri-
oritization process proposed in the paper helps business organizations to 
proactively design a pool of reliable suppliers minimizing the supplier 
risk and hence the impact of disruptions in event of disaster. The pro-
posed MIP is a unique model to assist the supply chain managers to 
optimally design their order allocation policies from multiple sources to 
meet the uncertain demand while keeping the overall cost and risk at 
minimum level. Moreover, the proposed model can be also of high 
sustainable value to business organizations in handling the disaster 
caused disruption scenarios such as unexpectedly high demand fluctu-
ations or supplier capacity failures in a cost-efficient manner. Another 
unique and interesting aspect of the proposed MIP is its application in 
the event of disruption where business organizations can be benefited by 
the proposed extended MIP enabling them to efficiently revise the reg-
ular orders and allocate emergency orders in an attempt to minimize the 
cost impact of disruptions and ensure business continuity. The case- 
illustration provided in the paper can also help managers to under-
stand and relate to the structural dynamics of the supplier selection 
process in presence of disruptive technologies and disaster caused

This paper contributes to the widely and extensively researched field 
of supplier selection. The contribution made in the paper is technically 


and theoretically a novel attempt as an integrated supplier segmenta-
tion, selection and order allocation in Industry 4.0 environment 
considering the disaster caused disruptions. The proposed model pre-
sents how the supplier selection decisions are affected when a conven-
tional industry transition into Industry 4.0. The requirements from the 
suppliers in industry 4.0 to handle the disaster caused disruptions are

different from a conventional industry. To address this concern, the 
proposed work presents a multi stage hybrid model for supplier seg-
mentation, prioritization and order allocation considering the industry 
4.0 environment in presence of demand and/or supply disruptions. The 
paper identifies the supplier selection criteria relevant to Industry 4.0 
environment. The set of criteria identified in the paper evaluates the 
technical competency of the supplier and the ability to handle disrup-
tions in Industry 4.0 environment. The paper also derives the average 
supplier risk by mapping their performance of the set of criteria with 
different kinds of risks involved. The supplier risk is then integrated into 
mixed integer program where the orders are allocated to the suppliers to 
meet the uncertain demand over a planning horizon such that total cost 
and the risk associated is simultaneously minimized. In case of disaster 
caused disruptions, the extended MIP tends to revise the regular order 
allocations and allocate emergency orders with the suppliers in such a 
way that incremental cost handling with the disruptions and overall risk 
is again minimized. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed 
model, a case of an automobile company is also considered under four 
disaster scenarios. 


6. Conclusions and future scope of work 


The fourth industrial revolution has led to the need of 


technologically upgrading the supply chains and for companies to 
identify the technologically competent partners. In addition to this, 
global supply chains also have to select the supply chain partners 
considering the risk of disruptions caused by natural and man-made 
disasters. Therefore, the paper addresses the reconfiguration of sup-
plier selection and order allocation process broadly from two perspec-
tives i.e. disruptive technologies and disruption risks. The paper 
proposes a multi-stage hybrid model for re-configuration of supplier 
selection process involving criteria identification, supplier segmenta-
tion, selection and order allocation jointly considering disruptive tech-
nologies and disruption risks. The paper identifies and prioritizes the 
technological criteria used for selecting suppliers for digitized supply 
chains, which are different from conventional criteria. The supplies are 
segmented into efficient and inefficient suppliers using DEA and the 
efficient suppliers are further evaluated and ranked using FAHP-TOPSIS. 
The paper also proposes a novel method to compute the supplier 
disruption risk using criteria-risk mapping. The paper proposes an MIP 
for the detailed supplier selection and order allocation against the un-
certain demand considering disruption risk. The extended MIP is also 
proposed to handle the disaster caused disruptions such as demand 
fluctuations & supply shortages by revising the initial allocation and 
allocating emergency orders on real time basis. The proposed multi stage 
hybrid model is illustrated using a case of an automobile company which 
is transitioning to Industry 4.0 and investing into disruptive technolo-
gies. The proposed model is helpful for the companies undergoing 
supply chain structural changes in order to adopt to disruptive tech-
nologies and how disruptions can be handled in reconfigured supply 
chain structure. The proposed multi-stage hybrid model can be extended 
in future to incorporated lead-time constraints, delays and late orders. In 
addition, the model can also be extended by integrating other supply 
chain functions such as production, warehousing, logistics etc. with 
supplier selection.

Credit author statement 


Harpreet Kaur developed the proposed model as well as the numerical case. She solved the proposed OR based model in LINGO and prepared the 
revised paper considering the reviewers comments. She also drafted the paper. Surya Prakash Singh provided the initial research idea of the proposed 
work using Multi-criteria decision making tools for supplier selection and order allocation under disruption and risk. He also assisted on improving the 
paper based on reviewer’s comments. 


Overall, the paper was discussed and prepared by these above two authors where several round of discussion happened over phone.
