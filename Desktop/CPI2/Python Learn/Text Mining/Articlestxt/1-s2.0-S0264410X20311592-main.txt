Concerns about the quality and use of immunization and vaccine-preventable disease (VPD) surveillance
data have been highlighted on the global agenda for over two decades. In August 2017, the Strategic
Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) established a Working Group (WG) on the Quality and Use of Global
Immunization and Surveillance Data to review the current status and evidence to make recommenda-
tions, which were presented to SAGE in October 2019.
The WG synthesized evidence from landscape analyses, literature reviews, country case-studies, a data


triangulation analysis, as well as surveys of experts. Data quality (DQ) was defined as data that are accur
ate, precise, relevant, complete, and timely enough for the intended purpose (fit-for-purpose), and data
use as the degree to which data are actually used for defined purposes, e.g., immunization programme m
anagement, performance monitoring, decision-making. The WG outlined roles and responsibilities for
immunization and surveillance DQ and use by programme level.
The WG found that while DQ is dependent on quality data collection at health facilities, many interven-


tions have targeted national and subnational levels, or have focused on new technologies, rather than the
people and enabling environments required for functional information systems. The WG concluded that
sustainable improvements in immunization and surveillance DQ and use will require efforts across the
health system — governance, people, tools, and processes, including use of data for continuous quality
improvement (CQI) — and that the approaches need to be context-specific, country-owned and driven
from the frontline up. At the country level, major efforts are needed to: (1) embed monitoring DQ and
use alongside monitoring of immunization and surveillance performance, (2) increase workforce capacity
and capability for DQ and use, starting at the facility level, (3) improve the accuracy of immunization pro-
gramme targets (denominators), (4) enhance use of existing data for tailored programme action (e.g.,
immunization programme planning, management and policy-change), (5) adopt a data-driven CQI
approach as part of health system strengthening, (6) strengthen governance around piloting and imple-
mentation of new information and communication technology tools, and (7) improve data sharing and
knowledge management across areas and organizations for improved transparency and efficiency.

Global and regional partners are requested to support countries in adopting relevant recommendations
for their setting and to continue strengthening the reporting and monitoring of immunization and VPD
surveillance data through processes periodic needs assessment and revision processes. This summary
of the WG’s findings and recommendations can support ‘‘data-guided” implementation of the new
Immunization Agenda 2030.

1. Background


Concerns about the quality and use of immunization and
vaccine-preventable disease (VPD) surveillance data for decision-
making have been highlighted on the global agenda for more than
two decades [1,2]. In 1998, following the identification of inconsis-
tencies in national-level vaccine coverage data reported to the
World Health Organization (WHO), the Strategic Advisory Group
of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) recommended intensified
efforts to improve immunization data quality, leading to the con-
ception of WHO/UNICEF estimates of national vaccine coverage
(WUENIC) [3], among other efforts.


Countries need quality data for immunization programmeman-
agement and decision-making and to meet the ambitious regional
and global vaccine coverage and disease elimination goals, such as
those that were outlined in the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP)
[4]. Subsequently, the GVAP companion document ‘‘Global Routine
Immunization Strategies and Practices (GRISP)” was developed to
‘‘reassert routine immunization as the foundation for sustained
decreases in morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable
diseases across the life-cycle of all individuals” [5]. GRISP empha-
sized the importance of improving data quality and use to guide
programme management and improvement.


Looking forward, the emphasis on data quality and use will
become even stronger with the development of the Immunization
Agenda 2030 (IA2030), which was endorsed by the World Health
Assembly in August 2020 and sets a global immunization strategy
to achieve a ‘‘world in which everyone, everywhere, at all ages,
fully benefits from vaccines for their health and well-being” and
which highlights ‘‘data-guided” as one of its four core principles
[6]. Improved information systems and quality data will also be
critical to measuring progress towards achieving the Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs) and Universal Health Coverage (UHC),
such as improvements in Primary Health Care across the life-
course and equity of service delivery [7–10]. Sustainable improve-
ments will require a whole-systems approach that includes people,
tools, governance, and processes including for continuous quality
improvement [11].


As a concrete measure towards improving data quality and use,
SAGE established a Working Group (WG) on the Quality and Use of
Global Immunization and Surveillance Data in August 2017 tasked
with (i) taking stock of immunization and VPD surveillance data
availability, quality, and use at country, regional, and global level;
(ii) assessing unmet monitoring needs at the global and regional
level; (iii) assessing any gaps in the standards and guidance on
immunization monitoring and surveillance; (iv) reviewing evi-
dence on the factors limiting data quality and use as well as the
effectiveness of related interventions; (v) reviewing the status of
information systems and modern technology to support the collec-
tion, management, analysis, and use of immunization and surveil-
lance data; and (vi) identifying any gaps in evidence and creating a
research agenda [12]. The WG’s final findings and recommenda-
tions were presented to SAGE in October 2019 [13]. This article
aims to summarize and disseminate the recommendations to
national and global stakeholders to support implementation of
the IA2030.

2. Methods


We considered vaccination coverage (the proportion of an eligi-
ble population who is vaccinated), immunization programme pro-
cess indicators (e.g., vaccination sessions), vaccine supply, and VPD
surveillance data to be within the scope of the review. Vaccine
safety and financial data were excluded.


We synthesized evidence across various landscape analyses, lit-
erature reviews, country case studies, surveys of immunization
experts, and a data triangulation analysis to address the tasks (i-
vi) outlined above. Detailed methods and reports for these reviews
and analyses can be found in the full WG report (chapter 1.2) and
the SAGE website [14]. In brief, the literature reviews that were
synthesized included systematic reviews, as well as a ‘‘realist
review” and several ‘‘scoping reviews” on key topics, including bar-
riers limiting data quality and use, and what works to improve data
use [15]. Although differing slightly in terms of methodology, all
literature reviews included searches of electronic databases (e.g.,
Pubmed) to identify relevant published literature and included
the grey literature. Where there was a paucity of high-quality evi-
dence, the WG employed expert opinion and consensus. Key infor-
mant interviews and self-administered questionnaires were
conducted among 22 immunization experts working at all levels
of WHO, partner agencies, ministries of health, and experts on vac-
cination coverage surveys and management of humanitarian
crises.


We structured our findings around a simplified theory of
change (Fig. 1) adapted from the Global Framework to Strengthen
Immunization and Surveillance Data for Decision-making [11]. The
theory of change includes five health systems areas where efforts
are needed — Governance, People, Tools, Processes (including for
Continuous Quality Improvement), and Evidence. The recommen-
dations made in the report aim to positively impact these areas
in order to generate data that are available, fit-for-purpose and
used for action, thereby resulting in increased vaccination cover-
age, equity and efficiency of service delivery, as well as decreased
VPD morbidity and mortality (Fig. 1).

3. Findings and observations


3.1. Definitions


The WG adopted a definition of data quality as data that are
accurate, precise, relevant, complete and timely enough for the
intended purpose (or ‘‘fit-for-purpose”), such as to monitor immu-
nization programme performance, support efficient programme
management or provide evidence for decision-making (Box 1)
[16,17]. ‘‘Data use” is the degree to which data are actually used
for a defined purpose, e.g., programme management, performance
monitoring, decision-making [16].

Box 1 Attributes of immunization and surveillance data quality, as defined as
‘‘fit-for-purpose”


Accuracy — Degree of agreement between a given mea-
surement and the actual (or true) value.


� Concurrence (proxy) — Degree of agreement between
different methods intended to measure the same


construct.


� Representativeness (proxy) — Degree to which popu-
lation measured reflects the intended target popula-


tion (e.g., similar distribution of important


characteristics).


� Integrity (proxy) — Degree to which data, once
entered into the official record, are not lost, incorrectly


transcribed from one record to another, or otherwise


altered from the original, i.e., accuracy of stored/


reported data.


Precision— Degree of spread among a series of measure-
ments that is independent of accuracy


� Consistency (proxy) — Degree to which data attributes
are free from contradiction and are coherent with other


data in a specific context of use, e.g., over time for one


indicator or across related indicators.


Relevancy — Degree to which the data collected and
reported reflect what is most important to support deci-


sion-making and not in excess of what is needed so as


to consume scarce resources.


Completeness — Degree to which all relevant data
needed for decision-making are recorded and reported


and therefore available for use.


Timeliness—Degree to which data are current and avail-
able when needed to inform decisions.

3.2. Availability, quality and use of immunization and surveillance
data, data-related guidance and assessment methods


There is a considerable amount and variety of immunization
and surveillance-related data available nationally, regionally, and
globally, though the data are not always accessible to those that
need them the most [16]. At the national level, routine coverage
data are available, through health management information sys-
tems (HMIS), and in some cases, stand-alone immunization report-
ing systems, and coverage surveys. Data for monitoring equity
usually comes from periodic coverage surveys or ad hoc studies
[18,19], while data for routine monitoring of high-risk populations
may not be available in most countries. Campaign coverage data
are often available but may not be well-archived or in a standard-
ized format for use. VPD surveillance data are collected nationally

7185

by integrated communicable disease surveillance systems and/or
disease-specific case-based surveillance (e.g., polio, measles,
rubella, neonatal tetanus). Adverse Event Following Immunization
(AEFI) monitoring systems exist in some form in most countries,
but may not be robust [16].


National reporting processes for administrative immunization
and VPD surveillance data were considered to be functioning well,
but the quality of these data is still often poor, especially in low-
and middle-income countries (LMICs) [20–26]. Reporting was not
always conducted according to guidelines, and the tools (forms,
hardware and software) were not always available or optimal to
support reporting processes [16]. Data from private providers
may not be included in routine reporting [16]. The inaccuracy of
denominators to calculate vaccine coverage or disease incidence
rates was identified during the review as a common problem
[27,28]. In addition to concerns over VPD surveillance data quality,
much of the aggregate VPD surveillance data collected lacks rele-
vant information (e.g., age, vaccination status, laboratory confirma-
tion) for immunization programme management [23,26,29,30].
The systematic linkage of laboratory and epidemiological data for
case-based VPD surveillance was identified as a current gap in
many countries [31]. Finally, there is also increased demand from
global partners for the collection and use of subnational and
individual-level immunization and VPD surveillance data to sup-
port achieving programme objectives [32,33].


Since 1988, the WHO-UNICEF Joint Reporting Form (JRF) has
collected standardized immunization, surveillance and other pro-
gramme data from all countries on an annual basis [34]. The JRF
reporting and validation process is revised every other year and
the data included have become more comprehensive, expanding
beyond coverage and surveillance to meet new monitoring needs
as the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) evolves. Sub-
national vaccination coverage data for several vaccine-doses has
been collected globally through the JRF since 2017, with known
limitations [32]. Plans to switch to an online reporting system
(eJRF) are ongoing and are related to the the development of
WHO Immunization Information SystEm (WIISE), an integrated
platform for management and visualization of coverage, surveil-
lance and other data at the global level that is projected to improve
data availability and usefulness [35]. At the global level, immuniza-
tion data collected through the JRF [34] and vaccination coverage
estimated for each country by WUENIC [36] remain key sources
of immunization data available openly on the WHO and UNICEF
websites [37,38].


The WG identified a large number of global and regional guid-
ance documents and standards that have been developed to
address issues related to EPI monitoring, data quality and use
[16,39]. However, people working in immunization and VPD
surveillance were not always aware or able to find and access rel-
evant documents. In addition, the WG identified a number of gaps
in guidance relating to various aspects of the monitoring and eval-
uation of vaccination programmes, including how to improve pro-
gramme targets (denominators), track mobile populations,
monitor vaccination across the life-course, and routinely monitor
coverage equity [16].


A number of tools for countries to assess immunization data
quality exist, such as the Data Quality Self-assessment (DQS) and
Data Quality Review (DQR) toolkit [40,41]. These tools have
evolved in a way that has improved country ownership and inter-
est in making data improvements, with some evidence of positive
impact on data quality and use as well (Table 1) [16,42]. A review
completed by the WG identified many data quality measures by
different quality attributes for immunization coverage, denomina-
tors, and surveillance data (available as an annex to the full WG
report) [16]. More work is needed to define a common lexicon of
definitions around data and a standard set of indicators to measure

data quality and use, as part of comprehensive programme moni-
toring [17].


3.3. Factors limiting and the effectiveness of interventions to improve
access, quality and use of immunization and surveillance data


Data quality loss or failure to share and use data can occur
through multiple mechanisms at all levels of the health system.
Data quality loss can result from failure to record properly, tran-
scription or calculation errors, missing or outdated forms, procedu-
ral gaps (e.g., not including private sector), lost or damaged
records, inaccurate denominator data, and intentional falsification
[17,43]. Root causes associated with poor data quality include gaps
in health worker capability and motivation, performance-based
targets, unsupportive leadership, lacking a culture of data use, poor
information system design, overly complex tools, inadequate poli-
cies and resources, and suboptimal processes for data collection
and reporting, including supervision and feedback [17,29,30,43–
45].


Types of barriers to sharing data locally and internationally
include technical (inadequate interoperability, standards, archiv-
ing procedures); motivational (lack of incentives, trust between
data providers and users, or resources/time needed); economic
(e.g., potential negative economic effects); political (bureaucratic
hurdles, lack of political will); legal; and ethical barriers [46,47].


Failure to use data can result from a lack of any of the following:
confidence in the quality of available data, data analysis and inter-
pretation skills, understanding on how to use data to monitor and
improve immunization programmes, or a culture of information
use (‘‘data use culture”) for various reasons [17,43,44,48].


3.4. Emerging issues and recent successes related to improving
immunization and surveillance data quality and use


There are many emerging issues for data quality, including the
need for more accurate population estimates to ensure coverage
accuracy especially as coverage increases [49] and to include
private-sector data in reports [50]. Access and full use of VPD
surveillance data that is relevant to immunization programme
planning and decision-making remains limited [23,26,33]. Another
monitoring challenge for immunization programmes is moving
from infant vaccination towards a life-course vaccination approach
[51]. As global vaccination policy moves to promote equity across
subpopulations and geographic areas, appropriate indicators and
routine monitoring beyond vaccination coverage need to be devel-
oped and implemented [52]. The development of global and regio-
nal guidance on monitoring immunization inequalities using
survey data is a step in the right direction [19]. More accurate tar-
get population estimates that include migrant and marginalized
populations, also remain a pressing need at the operational pro-
gramme level [7,52].


At the global level, developments noted by the WG that could
potentially help improve the quality and use of immunization
and surveillance data include new electronic platforms, like WIISE,
new guidance like on Electronic Immunization Registries [53], DQR
[40], WHO Immunization Data Handbook [54] and related bi-
lingual (English and French) distance-based learning initiatives
using the ‘‘WHO Scholar” platform, consisting of short video lec-
tures, discussion sessions, and real-life projects supported by
peer-learning and mentoring for enrolled students mostly working
at the national, subnational, and health facility levels [55,56]. The
revised VPD Surveillance Standards [33] and draft global Compre-
hensive VPD Surveillance Strategy [57], a companion document to
the IA2030, also emphasizes system-design based on the data
required to achieve surveillance objectives and greater access
and use of information to manage immunization programmes.

7187

At the national level, many countries are adopting online elec-
tronic health information systems resulting in improved data man-
agement and access, and some countries are demonstrating
success with electronic immunization registries (and others less
so) [42,53,58–61]. Large countries like India and China have
demonstrated success at using triangulation of immunization and
surveillance data to identify immunity gaps [16,62]. Denominator
improvement projects have occurred in many countries, including
use of geospatially modeled estimates [63–67]. While there is
increased uptake of Civil Registration and Vital Statistics (CRVS)
in some countries, progress in LMICs is likely to be slow [68–72].


3.5. Working group perspective on the current needs for improving
data quality and use


A recent realist review found that multicomponent interven-
tions are most effective for improving health data quality and
use [42], similar to the findings of a systematic review of interven-
tions for improving health worker performance [73]. For example,
no impact has been observed from technological interventions
alone, without the related capacity building [42]. Further, employ-
ing a health system approach that addressed multiple areas (e.g.,
standards, hiring data managers, data review meetings, and sup-
portive supervision) was found to be more likely to succeed and
be sustained over long-term [42,73].


The perspective of the WG is that sustainable improvements in
data quality and use require effort across the healthcare system
(i.e., governance, people, processes, tools), not just new technolog-
ical solutions. Continued exclusive focus on low-hanging fruit will
not address the root issues and achieve sustainable change. For this
reason, it is relevant to consider multicomponent interventions
within and across the five key areas of Governance, People, Tools,
Processes for Continuous Quality Improvement, and Evidence
towards improving data quality, access and use as part of a health
systems approach. The approaches need to be context-specific,
country-owned and driven from the frontline up.


4. Governance: Strengthening governance of data collection,
access, and use


Within the area of governance [74], there are several funda-
mental factors that enable collection of high-quality data, as well
as access and use (Box 2). Having strong policies (e.g., for eHealth)
and accountability mechanisms in place that govern all key aspects
of data collection, access, integration, and use is important to
develop immunization and VPD surveillance information systems
that produce high-quality, credible data that are useful to monitor






H.M. Scobie et al. Vaccine 38 (2020) 7183–7197

and improve programmes [11,75,76]. National standards govern-
ing all stages of data generation, use and sharing (both within orga-
nizations in country and internationally) that consider privacy and
confidentiality are needed [46,47].


Improving data quality and use requires leadership and com-
mitment from national governments, such as sufficient resources
and supportive policies and regulations, to facilitate a ‘‘data use
culture” for continuous quality improvement, as well as a willing-
ness to improve data quality — even if it initially leads to lower
reported performance [77]. Coordination and collaboration
between different units dealing with immunization and surveil-
lance data (e.g., immunization programme, surveillance units,
and laboratories in the public, private and not-for-profit sectors)
is crucial to establish efficient, sustainable information systems
that avoid data fragmentation and duplication [46,78]. The full
WG report (chapter 3) includes several examples of the positive
impact of robust national governance processes on vaccination
data quality and use [16].

5. People: Building capacity and capability of the health
workforce in data collection and use


Issues around health workers’ competencies related to data
management have been widely documented, including the lack
of sufficient capacity, capability and motivation in data collection,
analysis, interpretation and use [24,43,79–81]. These issues are key
factors limiting the quality and use of immunization and VPD
surveillance data [29,30,44,82,83]. Data quality at all levels ulti-

planning and capacity-building must specifically target the local
level [17].


Frontline staff are often over-burdened with multiple responsi-
bilities, including data collection for vertical programmes [14].
They spend a third of their time on data-related activities such as
recording and reporting [84,85], which often compete with clinical
duties, thus impacting the quality, completeness and timeliness of
reporting [86,87]. The data demands of global partners are not
always aligned with the priorities of national immunization pro-
grammes and can further burden frontline healthcare workers
[14,30,88]. The focus on technology — rather than on the people
who drive information systems — has often led to the development
and implementation of complex health management information
systems, or tools, without sufficient attention to human resources
required to run them [30,43,89].


Improving this situation requires a multi-pronged approach —
including improved workforce planning, pre-service and in-
service training, with regular reinforcement through supportive
supervision and effective feedback [73,89–91]. Adequate resour-
cing and dedicated person-time for data-related tasks also need
to be taken into consideration [92,93]. A global framework of
immunization workforce competencies has been developed that
may be helpful for this purpose [93,94]. Some countries such as
India [62] and Botswana [95] have dealt with the issue by creating
a cadre of health information personnel specifically trained and
dedicated to managing and analyzing data; more evaluation of
the usefulness and sustainability of this strategy is needed.


There are several recommended curricula available world-wide
for pre-service training of health professionals that include mod-
ules on the collection, analysis, management, and use of immu-

illance program. This schematic was developed by the SAGE Data Working Group.

nization data. These include the ‘‘EPI Prototype Curricula for doc-
tors and nursing/midwifery schools” in the WHO African Region
[96,97] and the Mid-Level Management Course for EPI managers
[98], which has been recommended for use both for pre-service
training and for certifying professionals for practice [99].


However, findings from a scoping review on pre- and in-service
training on immunization data management found that current
pre-service training programmes often do not adequately prepare
health workers to carry out data-related tasks, nor has most in-
service training on data had any major impact in improving the
skills and practices of health workers [81]. Governments therefore
need to make a dedicated effort to provide effective and continu-
ous competency-based training on the generation and use of
health data [92,93], incorporating adult learning theory and based
on the data-related responsibilities required at different levels of
the health system. Global partners should think strategically about
the added value of additional data requests, and prioritize
accordingly.


The WG developed a framework that defines the roles and
responsibilities of health workers in collecting, analyzing and using
immunization data from the facility to the global level in order to
assist countries in planning their capacity-building activities
related to immunization data and information systems (Fig. 2).
Interventions to address issues around data quality and insufficient
skills sets, including plans to hire new staff, should be focused on
elements of these competency frameworks [93,94].

6. Tools: Aligning information systems and technological
innovations with local context & programme needs


Advances in information and communication technology (ICT)
have led to a multitude of tools developed to address deficiencies
in data quality, availability and use (Table 2), which are described
in more detail in the full WG Report (chapter 5) [14]. Some of these
tools, in particular information systems and decision-support tools
(e.g., dashboards), can improve the quality and use of data [42] and
are in use in many countries globally, including in LMICs [100].
However, many tools do not go beyond the pilot stage, thereby
wasting financial and human resources [101]. The reasons include
over-enthusiasm for adopting technological innovations without
defining the problem to address, a lack of rigorous evaluation, as
well as insufficient consideration of critical ‘‘readiness” factors that
are pre-requisites for successful implementation [53,59]. Readi-
ness factors include the governance structures and procedures
needed to support the new technology, the human resource needs
to operate and use it, integration with existing systems, infrastruc-
ture requirements, and financial sustainability.


In general, there is a trend towards collecting, processing, and
analyzing immunization and VPD surveillance data as part of inte-
grated systems, rather than stand-alone systems developed specif-
ically for vaccine programmes [16]. An integrated approach creates
efficiencies from similar data requirements across health pro-
grammes, which facilitates data linkage and monitoring along the
continuum of care. However, when integrated systems do not meet
the needs of immunization programmes, the immunization com-
ponents of integrated tools may be underutilized and parallel EPI
information systems may continue, thus increasing the burden of
data collection, reporting, and management [16,102]. Effective
integration of immunization data tools with other information sys-
tems requires optimal coordination across health programs and
the establishment of information system standards, including min-
imum information datasets and interoperability frameworks, as
well as protocols for data sharing and protection [102]. Decision-
support tools, such as electronic dashboards for routine immuniza-

7189

tion monitoring, have shown promise and are particularly helpful
when incorporated into information systems [42,103].


New technologies can have a positive impact on the quality and
use of immunization and surveillance data. However, these inter-
ventions are not magic bullets, and are unlikely to be adopted by
countries in the long-term or to lead to long-lasting data improve-
ments unless other readiness factors and conditions are in place
[53,104]. Innovative approaches are also more likely to lead to
improved data use when they address a specific need, and when
they are implemented as part of a package of interventions includ-
ing standards, training, etc. [42].


Rigorous evaluation of these tools has not been conducted sys-
tematically, but is essential because the impact of new tools is not
always obvious [53,104]. Where evaluations have been done, they
have shown, for example, that mobile-based reporting does not
always improve timeliness, or that the implementation of a health
management information system does not systematically lead to
improved data use [42]. In general, more evidence is needed on
the impact, cost-effectiveness and sustainability of interventions
such as novel ICT approaches, including documented examples of
decisions on when and how to scale interventions.

7. Processes: Using immunization and surveillance data for
continuous quality improvement


Periodic data quality assessments (e.g., every 3–5 years) alone
have had limited impact on the quality of immunization and VPD
surveillance data (Table 1) [20,42]. Newer approaches that incor-
porate a systems assessment (governance, people, tools, processes)
and result in a data improvement plan (Table 1) [40,54] have
potential for greater impact in terms of addressing the root causes
of poor data quality [43]. In addition, the WG suggests shifting
from periodic assessments to routine monitoring of data quality,
including automated data validation checks and analyses on elec-
tronic information systems would have greater impact in terms
of improving data quality (i.e., as part of a feedback cycle including
real-time data correction) [40]. Monitoring data quality indicators
as part of comprehensive monitoring framework would help rein-
force the importance of improving data quality, in addition to
achieving coverage targets.


Some evidence indicates that data quality improvements can be
driven by increased data use [40], but the WG observed that much
of the data collected is underutilized. Data triangulation is ‘‘an
approach for critical synthesis of existing data from two or more
data sources to address relevant questions for programme plan-
ning and decision-making” [105]. We suggest that triangulation
of existing data, such as surveillance, rapid coverage monitoring,
and vaccine supply data should be routinely conducted for public
health analysis in order to create a more granular picture of pro-
gramme performance at subnational and national level [16,106].
To this end, draft guidance has already been developed, piloted
in countries, and used as part of a WHO Scholar course focused
on data triangulation [107].


We propose using data for CQI of immunization programmes
(not just data quality) should be the vision for the next decade,
including institutionalized and sustainable mechanisms for process
evaluation, supervision, and monitoring at all levels of the health
system [16]. Evidence from use of CQI in healthcare outside of
immunization indicates that using this approach has resulted in
long-lasting improvements to use of data for decision-making, as
well as improved clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction
[108,109]. Within EPI, the U.S. programme called IQIP (Immuniza-
tion Quality Improvement for Providers) and an earlier iteration
called AFIX (Assessment, Feedback, Incentives, and eXchange) are
well-documented examples of a CQI framework [110,111]. Exam-

ples of CQI guidance and projects in developing country settings
also exist, but better documentation of the effectiveness of these
approaches in different contexts and appropriate scale-up is needed
[16,108,112–115]. In general, greater emphasis on strategies to
improve immunization performance alongside measuring relative
improvements (e.g., coverage improvement since previous period,
change in number of unvaccinated children) [16,103,116,117],
rather than achieving absolute targets may be helpful.


When trying to address improvements over different health
system areas, the use of ‘‘maturity grids” to assess country capac-
ities has been a helpful development in terms of prioritizing and
coordinating technical support for improvement, such as those
proposed for immunization programmes and VPD surveillance in
Africa [118,119]. As part of the IA2030, increasing data-related
capacities to facilitate data-guided decision-making will be critical
for achieving goals on equity and vaccination across the life-course
so that every person benefits from vaccination and no one is left
behind [6].


8. Evidence: Filling gaps in evidence around data quality and
use


Several gaps in evidence and knowledge concerning key aspects
affecting the quality and use of immunization and VPD surveillance

7190

data were identified. Important challenges encountered by the WG
included the lack of a framework for what data is needed for
immunization programmes at different levels, the lack of consen-
sus on the definition of ‘‘data quality,” and the lack of monitoring
indicators related to ‘‘data use.” To address these fundamental
gaps, the WG has proposed a working definition and outlined attri-
butes of data quality and associated indicators, as well as uses of
data by level in order to advance the discussion. Further field-
testing and feedback from users are needed before key indicators
can be adopted as part of any global monitoring framework, e.g.,
for IA2030. Of note, relevant data quality indicators are likely to
differ by context and level.


Another fundamental challenge is the lack of evidence on how
better data quality and use leads to better decision-making and
better immunization programme performance, though examples
exist from other fields [108,109,120,121]. The IDEA project created
an evidence gap map that highlighted greater existing evidence for
the impact of interventions on improved immunization data qual-
ity and availability, but less existing evidence on what works to
support immunization data-guided decision-making, particularly
at the facility level [42].


The WG noted that much of the evidence reviewed regarding
interventions designed to increase data quality and use generally
lacked robust evaluations. There was very limited evidence on

the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and sustainability of interven-
tions which aim to improve data quality and use. For example,
despite the many pilots of novel ICT approaches for data collection,
processing and reporting, few documented examples exist of
evidence-based decisions on when and how to scale interventions.
Some of the better examples of evaluating and scaling of interven-
tions have been documented through the BID Initiative and the BID
Learning Network [122].


A research agenda was developed by the WG and is outlined in
Table 3 by each of the key areas of governance, people, tools and
processes including CQI. Research needed to fill gaps on specific
issues, such as processes for improving and incorporating local
immunization targets (denominators), the use of triangulation
and geospatial approaches for immunization monitoring and
planning, and the role of serosurveys as part of immunization pro-
gramme monitoring were also highlighted. More detail is provided
in the full WG Report of the SAGE WG on the Quality and Use of
Immunization and Surveillance Data (chapter 7) [14].


9. Conclusions


There is no shortage of immunization and VPD surveillance
data, at all levels — local, national, regional, and global. However,
data are not being used optimally to inform public health action,
either because data are not accessible where needed, are of

7191

insufficient quality, or are used insufficiently in routine decision-
making because of a lack of ‘‘data use culture.” Greater data use
can result in better quality data and ultimately contribute to better
immunization programme performance by better identifying and
targeting those who are eligible for vaccination [11,42].


Increasing and improving data use — and ultimately the perfor-
mance of the immunization programme — can come about through
strengthening the data-related skills and knowledge of health
workers and by making better use of a diverse range of available,
often-underused data, including through data triangulation. Trian-
gulation of independent sources like coverage, vaccine stock, and
surveillance data helps address and overcome the limitations of
individual data sources and enables the use existing data for
improved programme management and decision-making. For pro-
grammemonitoring, we suggest moving beyond an exclusive focus
on absolute performance targets to assessing relative improve-
ments in programme performance and data quality at various
levels.


In light of an absence of a consensus definition of immunization
data quality, we suggest a pragmatic definition of ‘‘fit-for-purpose,”
or good enough for performance monitoring, programme manage-
ment, or decision-making. Historically, the immunization data
quality debate has been focused on coverage accuracy, rather than
producing data of sufficient quality to help improve vaccination
and disease prevention. In order to achieve impact, we need to

refocus on the underlying causes of insufficient data quality and
use at different levels. Because data quality ultimately depends
on the quality of data collection at the point of vaccination, data
quality and use interventions must target the local level where
data collection occurs.


Creating a strong ‘‘data use culture” from the local to the global
level, where data is collected, reported, analyzed, used for decision-
making, and fed-back for improving the delivery of an immuniza-
tion programme would go a long way in driving data quality
upwards. Such a data use culture emphasizes moving beyond spo-
radic data quality reviews and assessments (often perceived as
‘‘tick box” requirements) that treat quality data as an outcome,
to supportive continuous quality improvement interventions that
demonstrate the public health impact of better data quality and
use to those who collect the data. Reasons for suboptimal data
quality and use are context-specific and multi-faceted, so it is nec-
essary to identify and address behavioral and organizational chal-
lenges along with building technical capacity [45,123].


To achieve sustainable improvements in data quality and use, a
health systems approach is needed. The SDGs and improving Pri-
mary Health Care to achieve UHC [9,10] are fundamental touch-
points for many of the needed changes, including robust
information systems, capacity-building on data, and use of data

7193

for continuous quality improvement. It is critical that efforts to
improve immunization data quality and use be integrated with
broader efforts to improve the overall performance of the immu-
nization programme and larger health system.


In order to promote a data use culture that maximizes the util-
ity of continuously improving data to achieve maximum popula-
tion protection through robust, data-guided immunization
programmes, we proposed specific recommendations under eight
broad categories, many of which are for national and subnational
levels (Table 4) [16]. These recommendations were endorsed by
SAGE in October 2019 [13] and will support ‘‘data-guided” imple-
mentation of the IA2030, within the broader efforts of UHC and
PHC [6,9,10]. We encourage countries, with the support of immu-
nization partners at the national, regional and global levels, to
adopt relevant recommendations for their settings, and to imple-
ment related multicomponent interventions through a health sys-
tems approach.
