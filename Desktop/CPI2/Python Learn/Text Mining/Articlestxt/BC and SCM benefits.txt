Blockchain technologies have captured the imagination of scholars, managers, and practitioners around the
world. It is widely accepted by these actors that blockchain is not a buzzword, but a highly disruptive technology
that is already remodeling the organizations and their supply chain business models. Despite the meaningful
advance in the last years, blockchain applications regarding the operations and supply chain management
(OSCM) are still in their infancy. Little is known about the role of blockchain in terms of operations traceability,
as well in areas such as e-commerce, agriculture, public services, etc. Therefore, this Special Issue seeks to extend
our understanding of blockchain applications in OSCM and how firms create and capture business value with
blockchain. To this effect, this Special Issue will provide a well-articulated and in-depth discussion of the role of
blockchain in creating value in the domain of OSCM. Specifically, it is expected that more light is shed on how
blockchain integrates with and impacts new business models, transforms relationships, and improves perfor-
mance and competitive advantage in OSCM. Also, the evolution of blockchain was reviewed in order to provide a
strong background to the readers. The literature review was performed taking into account a bibliometric
perspective of blockchain-related publications. The review supports the importance of this Special Issue by
highlighting the urgent needs of this topic in this reputable journal. Finally, we provide future research direc-
tions and a guide for the papers presented in this Special Issue.


1. Introduction to the special issue


In the digital age, virtually all business models have been under-
going unprecedented disruptions thanks to unending breakthroughs in
cutting-edge information and communication technologies (ICTs)
(Ismagilova, Hughes, Dwivedi, & Raman, 2019). A prominent and
highly disruptive technology is the blockchain, which is already con-
tributing to remodeling traditional business models and creating new
opportunities across the entire supply chain. As a rule, blockchain refers
“to a fully distributed system for cryptographically capturing and
storing a consistent, immutable, linear event log of transactions be-
tween networked actors” (Risius & Spohrer, 2017). Blockchain emerged
as a technology to perform transactions in the cryptocurrency market
(Nakamoto, 2008; Oh & Shong, 2017; Prybila, Schulte, Hochreiner, &
Weber, 2017). Also, blockchain applications have reached an author-
itative level in the financial sector, but it is only recently that they have
spanned other areas, such as the OSCM field. Blockchain is considered
as both a critical challenge and opportunity paradigm. For instance,
blockchain can trigger significant improvements in transparency, ac-
countability, and trust, security, efficiency and costs minimization
(Kshetri, 2018).


Additionally, blockchain is viewed as a solution for supply chain
management (SCM) traceability problems (Lu & Xu, 2017) and for
generating closer and trustworthy relationships (Aste, Tasca, & Di
Matteo, 2017; Wang, Luo, & Lee, 2019) not only between organizations
and their suppliers, but also through the entire SCM. On the one hand, a
blockchain-enabled smart contract (a script that can trigger a


transaction) has the potential of bringing high levels of efficiency with a
decentralized operation to SCM. On the other hand, blockchain can be
combined with other cutting-edge technologies (e.g., big data analytics,
the internet of things, cyber-physical systems, among others) to bring
about disruptive impacts in all specialized fields.


Despite the numerous potential benefits of blockchain, blockchain-
related concepts (e.g., enablers, adoption, implementation, etc.) are still
to be well mastered by a good number of managers. The challenges
about how they can ensure that blockchain adds value to their orga-
nizations and the SCM, remain unanswered. From the OSCM perspec-
tive, blockchain is still in its infancy, and all its potential remains un-
clear. For example, a recent review on bitcoin, blockchain and fintech
in the SCM (Fosso Wamba, Kamdjoug, Robert, Bawack, & Keogh, 2018)
identified few empirical studies using the survey method approach for
investigating these subjects. Moreover, this adds to the scarcity of stu-
dies reporting blockchain applications employing empirical ap-
proaches, including surveys (Ying, Jia, & Du, 2018).


Thus, the focus of this Special Issue provides a well-articulated and
in-depth discussion for OSCM scholars and practitioners in the in-
vestigation of the role of blockchain in creating value for OSCM.
Specifically, this Special Section seeks to shed more light on and gain an
in-depth understanding of how blockchain integrates with and impacts
new business models, transforms relationships, and improves perfor-
mance and competitive advantage in OSCM. Subsequently, we look
forward to unveiling substantial practical and theoretical implications
concerning blockchain in the OSCM context.


The remainder of this editorial is structured as follows. First, we rely

on a bibliometric approach to present the current status of research on
blockchain. This option enable us to highlight the most relevant sources
in blockchain research, and to delineate their growth. So, the top 20
affiliations are being established by the number of publications, fol-
lowed by the top 20 countries based on the number of publications and
cited references. The various levels and types of collaboration between
countries are also indicated. Then, a document-level analysis is con-
ducted, and includes the top 20 globally cited publications, the most
locally cited references, and a tree map of keywords provided by the
different authors. The next point is about a knowledge structure, which
is determined by highlighting the main themes and trends in blockchain
research. Through a network approach in terms of collaborations, we
then established a related intellectual and social structure. Ultimately,
future research directions on blockchain and its interplay with OSCM
are formulated, together with the papers selected for this Special Issue.


2. What is the current status of research on blockchain?


2.1. Source-level analysis


To analyze academic research papers on blockchain, we down-
loaded all the bibliometric data on blockchain found in the Web of
Science (WoS) Core Collection database on October 17, 2019. We used
“blockchain” as the key phrase, knowing that all papers with this phrase
in their title, keywords or abstracts would be detected, thereby ensuring
completeness in our document collection. WoS is widely recognized as
the most reliable academic database, as it contains the most recognized,
high-profile and high-quality international academic publications
(Batistič & van der Laken, 2019; Zhang, Huang, Porter, Zhang, & Lu,
2019). We retrieved 3507 documents and made a number of observa-
tions: (i) publications on blockchain began in 2013 and were on the rise
until 2018; (ii) the number of publications decreased drastically in
2019, leading to an annual growth rate of -9.43 %; (iii) as the year 2019
is not over yet, the trends show that this annual growth rate may
change. Table 1 presents the top 20 blockchain publication sources in
the above-mentioned dataset, while Fig. 1 shows the evolution in the
number of publications by year. Most of the leading publication outlets
are conferences or open access journals. Once more, we can observe a
decrease in the number of publications.


2.2. Author-level analysis


Table 2 shows the top 20 relevant affiliations by the number of
publications. The first striking observation is that leading universities
and research institutions worldwide like Stanford University, MIT and


Oxford University are not among the leaders in this research domain.
Also, we notice that IBM Research is among the leading publishers on
blockchain in academic outlets.


Table 3 presents the top 20 countries based on the number of
publications. Like in most cases, China and the USA are the world
leaders in academic publications in most research fields. The next top
country is the UK, which has published only about half as many
documents as the USA. However, we can observe that the USA has more
citations than China. This is an interesting result because it raises issues
related to the quality, applicability, relevance and visibility of pub-
lications from China.


Nevertheless, we can observe an almost equal involvement of the
North American, Asian and European continents in blockchain research
publications. The distribution of blockchain publications worldwide
shows that all world regions are publishing academic research on
blockchain, although there are a few countries not publishing yet,
especially on the African continent. In any case, the top 5 most cited
countries remain the USA, China, the UK, Germany, and South Korea.


Another interesting fact is the collaboration between these coun-
tries. Fig. 2 shows the international collaboration intensity per country
for the top 20 countries. We observed that most countries are colla-
borating with other countries to publish research on blockchain. Also,
there are more single-country publications (SCPs) than multiple-
country publications (MCPs), thus indicating that collaborations in
blockchain research are mostly between institutions of the same
country.


2.3. Document-level analysis


In Table 4, we present the 20 most globally cited publications and
unveils the most influential publications in blockchain research. We can
observe from the topics that blockchain researchers mostly cited works
on smart contracts, privacy, security, and the blockchain architecture.


When we went further to analyze the most locally cited references in
our dataset’s reference list, as shown in Table 5, we identified the his-
torical origins of blockchain research domains and topics in terms of
contributions with a strong impact in the field. Evidently, the most
impactful reference is that of Bitcoin as an electronic cash system
(Nakamoto, 2008). This is the study that initiated contemporary re-
search on blockchain. However, reflections on how to minimize risks of
catastrophic failures or vulnerabilities in computer systems that led to
the development of blockchains started with the "Byzantine Generals
Problem” (Lamport, Shostak, & Pease, 1982).


To further understand the blockchain research field, we analyzed
the keywords found in our dataset (Figs. 3 and 4). We considered the

author’s keywords and keywords plus (keywords obtained from the ti-
tles of references in our collection that were not necessarily provided by
the authors). Both types of keywords provided us with a better under-
standing of the depth and breadth of the blockchain research field. We
found that blockchain research had so far mostly focused on bitcoin,
smart contracts, security, the internet of things (IoT), and blockchain
technology. Keywords Plus revealed that these research studies are
generally conducted in the context of management, security, tech-
nology, bitcoin, and IoT.


3. Conceptual structure


This section presents the main themes and trends in blockchain
research.


3.1. Factorial analysis


Two main clusters characterize the conceptual structure of block-
chain research, as shown in Fig. 5. The red cluster represents research
on blockchain technologies, techniques and applications while the blue
cluster represents emerging computing technologies applied to the
blockchain.


3.2. Thematic evolution


Fig. 6 presents the thematic evolution of blockchain research. Based
on the publication distribution, we analyzed the evolution of block-
chain research themes in two intervals: 2013–2018, and 2019 onwards.
Our first observation is that studies in information security are diver-
ging into bitcoin. Secondly, research on bitcoin is diverging into


blockchain technology, distributed ledger technology, and the internet
of things (IoT). Thirdly, smart grid technology is diverging into block-
chain technology. Fourthly, decentralization is diverging into the
blockchain; and lastly, cloud computing is diverging into IoT topics.


Following co-citation analysis, the results revealed three main
clusters that show the three categories of blockchain research that in-
tellectually characterize this research field. Cluster 1 represents re-
search that focuses on bitcoin. Cluster 2 reveals research that focuses on
blockchain and smart contracts with their applications. Finally, Cluster
3 represents research on issues (challenges, vulnerabilities, limitations)
related to the bitcoin and blockchain protocols. In addition, we used
collaboration networks to show how institutions and countries relate
and interact with each other in blockchain research. We identified three
main clusters in blockchain research. All clusters had a very diverse set
of institutions in terms of country. However, each of the two most
prominent clusters of countries collaborating in blockchain research

and Asian countries while Cluster 2 consisted of European countries.


4. Future research directions


Blockchain technologies have been capturing the imagination and
bringing challenges and opportunities for both academics and practi-
tioners. Even though blockchain has advanced considerably in recent
years, as identified in our literature review, there is a big gap regarding


mainly empirical studies (Fosso Wamba et al., 2018; Frizzo-Barker
et al., 2019). The review of blockchain showed an interesting increase
in the number of published papers, mainly in 2018 and 2019. Besides,
the most relevant sources identified in blockchain research were
dominated by the IEEE (journals and conferences). Thus, it reinforces
the paucity of blockchain studies from the perspective of information
management. Moreover, the blockchain technologies have demon-
strated strong adherence in the context of operations and supply chain
management (Kshetri, 2018; Queiroz & Fosso Wamba, 2019; Ying et al.,

2018). Nevertheless, studies contemplating the interplay of blockchain
and supply chain remain at their embryonic stages (Queiroz, Telles, &
Bonilla, 2019). Against this backdrop, the “International Journal of In-
formation Management” has been endeavoring to publish more high-
quality papers about blockchain. Such an effort, coupled with our
current analysis of the blockchain literature, is expected to usher in
greater motivation for those willing to publish in this Special Issue.


Though the literature on blockchain is still at its infancy (Janssen,
Weerakkody, Ismagilova, Sivarajah, & Irani, 2020), it represents a ro-
bust foundation for studies in the area of information management
(Hughes et al., 2019) while the interplay between blockchain and other
cutting-edge technologies (2017a, Duan, Edwards, & Dwivedi, 2019;
Dwivedi et al., 2019; Kshetri, 2017b) could offer a high potential for
tackling OSCM problems. Our search found that the top five most-cited
countries are led by the USA and China, which top the list, followed by
two European nations, namely the UK and Germany, and completed by
South Korea. In a context where these nations represent a high level of


industrialization, it is therefore important that both the academia and
industry sectors develop strategic projects involving cutting-edge
technologies in developing countries. Hence, such an outlook should
offer extensive opportunities for future research on blockchain in their
OSCM.


Blockchain applications in OSCM tend to work together with other
cutting-edge technologies. For instance, blockchain can be well com-
bined with artificial intelligence (Dwivedi et al., 2019), IoT (Kshetri,
2018), and big data (Chae, 2019), among others. As reported pre-
viously, mainly in the treemap of keywords and in the Dendrogram,
there is an evident lack of studies on blockchain in the OSCM field. This
may also explain the importance of this Special Issue. In addition,
considering the thematic map, the thematic evolution of blockchain
research and the main blockchain research themes and trends, in-
sightful suggestions about hot topics in blockchain research have
emerged. For instance, there have been successful experiences re-
garding the integration of blockchain with artificial intelligence

techniques for product traceability improvement in supply chains
(Chen, 2018), with IoT (Reyna, Martín, Chen, Soler, & Díaz, 2018) in
order to increase trust among supply chain partners, and with bitcoin to
support sharing economy business models, among others. Finally, we
consider the results of our bibliometric analysis and the papers selected
for this Special Issue to make the following suggestions in terms of
research directions:


• The interplay between blockchain and artificial intelligence in
OSCM and how this interaction could contribute to creating value.
• How can blockchain leverage the traceability of food supply chains
in a global perspective?
• How can blockchain effectively contribute to enhancing the re-
lationships between social variables (e.g., trust, power, knowledge
sharing, cooperation) and supply chain members?
• Is blockchain a tamper-proof system to e-commerce, procurement,
etc?
• What is the role of blockchain in health care systems?• What is the impact of blockchain in the environment? How can it
affect an organization's business operation models?
• Is blockchain a sustainable technology to help organizations create
value? What is the role of the blockchain continuance intention?


• What are the real cost savings that blockchain technologies enable
in supply chain transactions by minimizing the intervention of in-
termediaries?


On the other hand, there is a need to underscore the importance of
developing more empirical studies on blockchain in OSCM as well as on
its integration with other cutting-edge technologies. Moreover, al-
though the blockchain technologies being applied in representative
emerging economies (e.g., India, China, Malaysia), such countries, like
their counterparts form the developing world, are expected to put in
more effort to understand the various blockchain adoption stages.


5. Papers in this special issue


The focus of this Special Issue was to invite OSCM scholars and
practitioners to ponder on how blockchain integrates with and impacts
new business models, transforms relationships, and improves perfor-
mance and competitive advantage in OSCM. By so doing, this Special
Issue contributes to shedding more light on the dynamics of blockchain
in OSCM while unlocking opportunities regarding blockchain integra-
tion in OSCM-related fields. All papers accepted for this Special Issue
are in line with the objectives indicated earlier. A total of twelve

distinguished research articles have been selected.
The first paper, entitled “A blockchain-based framework of cross-


border e-commerce supply chain”, by Liu and Li, presents an exciting
blockchain framework focused on product transactions and traceability
in e-commerce. The paper proposes new approach methods and algo-
rithms which can improve security, and traceability in e-commerce’s
supply chains, and therefore contribute to minimizing counterfeit at-
tacks (Liu & Li, 2019).


The second paper titled “An intelligent blockchain-based system for
safe vaccine supply and supervision”, by Yong, Shen, Liu, Li, Chen and
Zhou, demonstrates a blockchain application for a safe vaccine in
Chinese supply chains. Their research develops a blockchain system
integrated with machine learning and smart contracts for vaccine su-
pervision. The proposed blockchain system can enhance the traceability
of vaccines, prevent frauds, provide a more effective demand fore-
casting and, consequently, minimize the expiration of vaccines (Yong
et al., 2019).


In the third paper, “Blockchain technology in supply chain man-
agement for sustainable performance: Evidence from the airport in-
dustry”, by Di Vaio and Varriale, the authors explore the blockchain
interplay with supply chain and sustainable performance. They describe
the case of a collaborative blockchain platform in an Italian airport.
Besides, the paper reports the main benefits produced by the blockchain
platform and its convergence to sustainable performance (Di Vaio &
Varriale, 2019).


In the fourth paper, “Perception-based model for analyzing the
impact of enterprise blockchain adoption on SCM in the Indian service
industry”, by Karamchandani, S. Srivastava and R. Srivastava, the au-
thors address the issue of enterprise blockchain adoption by relying on
a research model derived from the well-known technology acceptance
model (TAM) and the innovation diffusion theory (IDT). The paper
identifies six supply chain management dimensions, namely “the cus-
tomer relationship, information quality, service quality, supply un-
certainty, mass customization, and delivery reliability” related to
blockchain perceived benefits in supply chains (Karamchandani,
Srivastava, & Srivastava, 2019).


In the fifth paper, “A blockchain use case in food distribution: Do
you know where your food has been?”, by Bumblauskas, Mann, Dugan
and Rittmer, the authors provide insights into a use case for blockchain


food traceability in the U.S. context. The paper demonstrates a proof-of-
concept approach, the needs and benefits for building food supply
chains that are more transparent, reliable, efficient and cost-effective.
Thus, increased transparency and the use of traceability mechanisms
can enhance the relationships between supply chain partners
(Bumblauskas, Mann, Dugan, & Rittmer, 2019).


In the sixth paper is entitled “Time to seize the digital evolution:
Adoption of blockchain in operations and supply chain management
among Malaysian SMEs”, by Wong, Leong, Hew, Tan, and Ooi. The
paper evaluates the adoption of blockchain by small and medium en-
terprises (SMEs) in a Malaysian context, for their operations and the
management of their supply chains. The study proposes a research
model based on the technology, organization and environment
Framework (TOE), and points out exciting findings regarding the sig-
nificant influence that competitive pressure, complexity, cost and re-
lative advantage exert on the intention to adopt blockchain (Wong,
Leong, Hew, Tan, & Ooi, 2019).


The seventh paper, “Boundary conditions for traceability in food
supply chains using blockchain technology”, by Behnke and Janssen,
clearly sets the boundary conditions for which blockchain technologies
in food supply chains can lead to increased traceability. In the first
place, the authors report four interview-based cases involving food
supply chains, then provide an analysis that takes into account five
elements, namely business, supply chain process, regulation, quality
assurance, and traceability. Finally, they identify eighteen boundary
conditions distributed in these five elements (Behnke & Janssen, 2019).


In the eighth paper, “Blockchain technology and enterprise opera-
tional capabilities: An empirical test”, by Xiongfeng Pan, Xianyou Pan,
Song, Ai and Ming, the authors present the interplay of blockchain
technology with enterprise operational capabilities. The paper identi-
fies fifty blockchain technology-listed enterprises in the Chinese con-
text, then they argue that the enterprise’s total asset is one of the most
prominent variables concerning the implementation of blockchain
(Pan, Pan, Song, Ai, & Ming, 2019).


The ninth paper, “Land records on Blockchain for implementation of
Land Titling in India”, by Thakur, Doja, Dwivedi, Ahmad and
Khadanga, reports the land records management problems in India and
how blockchain technologies can solve them. The authors provide a
well-articulated description of blockchain in land records process, as

well as the main challenges (Thakur, Doja, Dwivedi, Ahmad, &
Khadanga, 2019).


In the tenth paper, “Blockchain, adoption, and financial inclusion in
India: Research opportunities”, by Schuetz and Venkatesh, the authors
present a resourceful work about the connection of blockchain tech-
nologies and their potential to facilitate financial inclusion in rural
Indian areas. The authors suggest that global supply chain challenges
like high costs, geographical access, financial literacy and inappropriate
banking products could be met by blockchain adoption. To crown it all,
the study highlights the antecedents of blockchain adoption (Schuetz &
Venkatesh, 2019).


The eleventh paper, “Analysing the impact of blockchain-tech-
nology for operations and supply chain management: An explanatory
model drawn from multiple case studies”, by Tönnissen and Teuteberg,
strove to develop an exploratory model supported by a multiple case
analysis approach. The proposed model provides essential insights into
the dynamics of the relationship between the various actors as a result
of the impact of blockchain not only on the supply chain stakeholders,
but also on operations and supply chain business models, not to men-
tion the role of disintermediation (Tönnissen & Teuteberg, 2019).


In the last paper, “Modeling the blockchain enabled traceability in
agriculture supply chain”, by Kamble, Gunasekaran and Sharma, the
authors identify the enablers of blockchain technologies for supply
chains in agriculture in India. The authors identified thirteen enablers,
the most influential of which are traceability, auditability, immut-
ability, and provenance in the agricultural sector (Kamble,
Gunasekaran, & Sharma, 2019).
