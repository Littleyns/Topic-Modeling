Abstract 


Under the concept of "Industry 4.0", production processes will be pushed to be increasingly interconnected, 


information based on a real time basis and, necessarily, much more efficient. In this context, capacity optimization 


goes beyond the traditional aim of capacity maximization, contributing also for organization’s profitability and value. 


Indeed, lean management and continuous improvement approaches suggest capacity optimization instead of 


maximization. The study of capacity optimization and costing models is an important research topic that deserves 


contributions from both the practical and theoretical perspectives. This paper presents and discusses a mathematical 


model for capacity management based on different costing models (ABC and TDABC). A generic model has been 


developed and it was used to analyze idle capacity and to design strategies towards the maximization of organization’s 


value. The trade-off capacity maximization vs operational efficiency is highlighted and it is shown that capacity 


optimization might hide operational inefficiency.

1. Introduction 


The cost of idle capacity is a fundamental information for companies and their management of extreme importance 


in modern production systems. In general, it is defined as unused capacity or production potential and can be measured 


in several ways: tons of production, available hours of manufacturing, etc. The management of the idle capacity

Abstract


Today, most enterprises are undergoing a digitization process with the fourth industrial revolution, named industry 4.0. The focus 
of the digital transformation lies mainly on production, therefore the terms such as “Factory of the Future” or “Smart Factory” are 
used similar with this concept. However, there are many reasons for considering the impact of digitalization in logistics and the 
importance of supply chain for industry 4.0. The key promises of this concept are enabling real-time full-transparency from 
suppliers to customers, small lot sizes, multiple product variants, connected processes and decentralized, autonomous management. 
These benefits cannot be achieved by production alone, but only along the entire supply chain. Moreover, logistics should gain a 
greater vision to fulfill the requirements of industry 4.0 as sustainably as possible in terms of using appropriate technologies and 
enhancing vertical and horizontal integration among the supply chain partners. In this respect, this study highlights the benefits of 
the digitization of logistics process and examines the sustainability impact of digitization in logistics. The study is pursued as a 
single case study within the FMCG companies and their transport service providers in Turkey and it is based on a qualitative 
method and on connected semi-structured interviews.

and practices have improved, new technologies have introduced and the size and scale of industrial production have
expanded enormously [20]. The core idea of Industry 4.0 is to use the emerging information technologies to implement 
Internet of Things (IoT) and services so that business process and engineering process are deeply integrated making 
production operate in a flexible, efficient, and green way with constantly high quality and low cost [17]. However,
digital transformation lies mainly on production with respect to achieving the desired objectives towards “Smart 
Factory” such as real-time full-transparency from suppliers to customers, small lot sizes, multiple product variants, 
connected processes and decentralized, autonomous management. It is impossible to realize a smart factory unless the 
relevant logistics processes are also “smart” [16]. Digitization is an important instrument in realizing a reliable and 
sustainable future transport system and supply of goods [15]. Logistics gains a greater vision in terms of mass adoption 
of smart and connected digital technologies and applications (e.g. mobile, cloud, sensors, data analytics, machine 
learning, blockchain, IoT) and enhancing vertical and horizontal integration among the supply chain partners. This is 
likely to result in radical shift in ways of business thinking and implementation in logistics that has created a need for 
a new business paradigm toward a connected, smart, highly efficient and sustainable digital logistics ecosystem that 
is fully transparent to all the players involved - from the suppliers of raw materials, components, and parts, to the 
transporters of those supplies and finished goods, and finally to the customers demanding fulfillment [14]. However, 
the industry transformation of matter, energy and labor into goods, services, waste and ambient emissions, has 
generated high levels of economic wealth, simultaneously it results in increasing human interference with the 
biosphere, industrial activity produces about 22% in total final energy consumption, and about 20% in global CO2 
emissions [18]. The ambition with the digitization of industrial sector should therefore be considered to transformative 
change towards more sustainable, resilient and just societies, as defined by the World Commission on Environment 
and Development [19]. Digital alone has the immense opportunity to reduce emissions from logistics by as much as 
10 to 12% by 2025 [9] and to help decarbonize the global economy. Hence, the aim of the sustainable digital logistics 
ecosystem is to rethink digitally-based business models and redesign the way of business processes along the supply 
chain to sustainable development and to balance the sustainability in terms of economic, social and environmental 
dimensions and reflect the interconnections between them [7] [8] [9]. 


This paper aims to examine the sustainability impact of digitization in logistics and also find out what are the 
digitization characters and associated technologies in logistics network, how the adoption of digitization changed the 
logistics processes and which benefits have been obtained through digitization. The study is based on a case study 
qualitative research approach incorporating Delphi panel carried out in four fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) 
companies and two transport service providers conducted in Turkey. 


2. Digitization in logistics


Digitization or digitalization means basically capturing an analog signal and converting it into digital form for the 
purpose of generating a digital representation that can be electronically stored or processed [1]. Digitization makes 
information and communication available anywhere, anytime, within any context, and for any user using any device 
and type of access. With the increasing use of computer technology, a greater proportion of recorded information has 
become digital, as in 1993, only 3% of the world’s recorded information was stored digitally, this figure had reached 
to 94% by 2007 [6]. The better information and transactions are captured and processed, the more systems get equipped 
with certain degree of intelligence, and the more these systems communicate with each other through interconnections, 
the higher is the level of digitization of a network e.g. an entire supply chain or a single logistics process. The 
digitization disrupts logistics processes partly or completely [8] but could also create intrinsic value for the industry 
and wider society. Building logistics network with digital technologies would offer a new degree of resiliency and 
responsiveness enabling companies to escalate the competition in effort to provide customers with the most efficient 
and transparent service delivery [14], as using analytic technology (e.g. hyperconnectivity, supercomputing, Big Data) 
obtains large-scale logistics data and applying complex algorithms into this data helps companies where they can save
money, increase margins and operate more cost-effectively and environmentally friendly. According to white paper 
from the World Economic Forum indicates that digitization in logistics could provide $1.5 trillion in value through 
the year 2025 [9]. The digital logistics ecosystem is based on four key enablers: technology, process, organization and 
knowledge [6]. Integrating technology and applications with good knowledge management across organizations and

business processes is critical to the success of digital logistics strategies. The digitization in logistics is based on six 
characteristics: cooperation, connectivity, adaptiveness, integration, autonomous control and cognitive improvement.
The full implementation of wide range of digital technologies such as mobile, cloud, sensors, augmented reality, three-
dimensional (3D) printing, data analytics, IoT and others, in logistics processes enables: integrated planning and 
execution systems, logistics visibility, autonomous logistics, smart procurement and warehousing, spare parts 
management, and advanced analytics [14]. A digital logistics designed with the aforementioned six characteristics and 
available technologies provides significant benefits to manage, plan and synchronize freight and logistics operations:
real-time, full transparency along the entire supply chain, visibility and efficiency for transport chains and logistics 
center, high optimization potential through big data analytics, device and location independent information gathering 
through cloud computing, low management complexity through decentralized, autonomous decision-making, open 
intelligent user interface/software design for enabling horizontal and vertical collaboration, better automation through 
human-machine interaction, reducing failures in complex processes and enabling comprehensive consumer experience 
through augmented reality solutions (e.g. wearable computing) and more. In addition, these digital technologies allow 
the companies to timely react to disruptions along the supply chain and to adapt changes in logistics processes and 
even to predict possible risks by modelling the system with what-if scenario analysis.


The digitization of the entire process for plan, source, make, deliver and return will further improve logistics 
processes, optimize workflows and reduce lead times. Fig. 1 depicts a sustainable digital logistics ecosystem, which
shows how digitization impacts logistics from the perspective of economic, environmental and social dimensions of 
sustainability. The sustainability dimensions should reflect:
• Economic: affordable system that operates efficiently, offers collaborative solutions and a mix of transport mode 


choices and supports the local economy. 
• Environmental: reduced greenhouse gas emissions, pollution and waste, minimized consumption of non-renewable 


energy sources and uses technologies that reuses and recycles its components.
• Social: basic access needs of individuals/communities to be met safely and support good lifestyles, and with equity 


within and between generations.

The detailed descriptions of digitization characteristics in logistics are as follows:
• Cooperation: cooperative action (e.g. shared warehouse and transport capacities) through digitization has the 


potential to improve the efficiency and reliability of the logistics industry [9], this creates special needs for inter-
organizational information exchange and data integration and an architecture to support virtual logistics clusters. 
The virtual service providers assemble several companies (or partners) into strategic alliances that allow sharing of 
their physical facilities to achieve utilization of logistics service beyond their own region of operation [12]. For 
example, the pooling of warehousing and transportation facilities over a widely geographical distributed area of 
operation through a digitally integrated cross-border logistics hub. A digital operating model is all about 
implementing digital capabilities along the organizational layers of governance, processes, data and performance 
management, and information technology. It allows for required levels of integration and standardization of 
processes [24].


• Connectivity refers the ability of a technology to act as an interface to other digital resources on the network, or to 
accept a connection from another resource [13]. Digitization through connectivity enables vertical integration from 
supplier to customer as well as horizontal integration among other competitors and other business partners along 
the supply chain in order to sustain end-to-end visibility. The technologies such as machine-to-machine (M2M),
hyper-connectivity, super-computing and real-time big data analytics enable companies to match the supply and 
demand for underused assets and products. The cloud, in combination with mobile and social media, can 
dematerialize products or even entire industries. The logistics system is made more intelligent and increases 
productivity through self-regulating processes in order to avoid errors and unplanned interruptions. Moreover, 3D 
printing creates opportunities for manufacturing inputs that are biodegradable (e.g. cocopallet) or infinitely 
recyclable [5].


• Adaptiveness: Digitization refers an open dynamic adaptable system which is characterized by the fact that the 
components and their relations change over time and also it can be influenced by events outside of the system 
boundaries. The system of networked digital resources is both adaptable (system that can be changed by an external 
actor, e.g. through a graphical user interface) and self-adaptive (system that modify themselves in response to 
perceived changes in the environment, e.g. user-input or changes in the internal composition of the system) [13]. 
For instance, smart containers or smart bins are adaptable to different sensors to track and trace.


• Integration refers to the ability of system to connect, integrate, monetize and share any data, device, system and 
process in near or real time in the digital economy. In information technology, logistics systems integration is the 
process of linking together different computing systems and software applications physically or functionally, to 
act as a coordinated whole logistics flows. It adds additional value because of interactions between logistics 
subsystems. Three types of integrations are possible: (1) horizontal integration through value networks, (2) vertical 
integration and networked logistics systems, and (3) end-to-end digital integration of logistics across the entire 
value chain [17]. Software as a Service (SaaS) applications and other digital service platforms allow 
communication between back-end systems of organizations, thereby traditional data centers and enterprise services
are seamlessly connected with cloud, mobile, and other application programming interface (API) digital 
ecosystems. Digitally enabled global logistics platforms are configured with this system logic to connect all users 
(e.g. shippers, logistics services) in order to sustain a real time operating environment. Those platforms consolidate 
demand from several shippers, optimizing the end-to-end logistics planning process and based on warehouse 
location and targeted delivery location, suggesting appropriate transport modes [9].


• Autonomous control: Digitization enables decentralized, autonomous decision making. Autonomous refers literally 
acting independently and without outside control. The machine-learning technologies (e.g. transvoyant) help to 
make predictive analytics. Daily many real-time events can be collected and analyzed from sensors, satellites, 
radar, video cameras and smartphones [2]. In logistics applications, algorithm tracks the real-time movement of 
shipments and calculates their estimated time of arrival, factoring the impact of weather conditions, port congestion 
and natural disasters. Adidas is implementing an omni channel strategy, allowing customers to buy in a number of 
ways (online and in physical store) and to get delivered in any way (at home, at the store or at a pick-up point) by 
using analytics.

operation through a digitally integrated cross-border logistics hub. A digital operating model is all about 
implementing digital capabilities along the organizational layers of governance, processes, data and performance 
management, and information technology. It allows for required levels of integration and standardization of 
processes [24].


• Connectivity refers the ability of a technology to act as an interface to other digital resources on the network, or to 
accept a connection from another resource [13]. Digitization through connectivity enables vertical integration from 
supplier to customer as well as horizontal integration among other competitors and other business partners along 
the supply chain in order to sustain end-to-end visibility. The technologies such as machine-to-machine (M2M),
hyper-connectivity, super-computing and real-time big data analytics enable companies to match the supply and 
demand for underused assets and products. The cloud, in combination with mobile and social media, can 
dematerialize products or even entire industries. The logistics system is made more intelligent and increases 
productivity through self-regulating processes in order to avoid errors and unplanned interruptions. Moreover, 3D 
printing creates opportunities for manufacturing inputs that are biodegradable (e.g. cocopallet) or infinitely 
recyclable [5].


• Adaptiveness: Digitization refers an open dynamic adaptable system which is characterized by the fact that the 
components and their relations change over time and also it can be influenced by events outside of the system 
boundaries. The system of networked digital resources is both adaptable (system that can be changed by an external 
actor, e.g. through a graphical user interface) and self-adaptive (system that modify themselves in response to 
perceived changes in the environment, e.g. user-input or changes in the internal composition of the system) [13]. 
For instance, smart containers or smart bins are adaptable to different sensors to track and trace.


• Integration refers to the ability of system to connect, integrate, monetize and share any data, device, system and 
process in near or real time in the digital economy. In information technology, logistics systems integration is the 
process of linking together different computing systems and software applications physically or functionally, to 
act as a coordinated whole logistics flows. It adds additional value because of interactions between logistics 
subsystems. Three types of integrations are possible: (1) horizontal integration through value networks, (2) vertical 
integration and networked logistics systems, and (3) end-to-end digital integration of logistics across the entire 
value chain [17]. Software as a Service (SaaS) applications and other digital service platforms allow 
communication between back-end systems of organizations, thereby traditional data centers and enterprise services
are seamlessly connected with cloud, mobile, and other application programming interface (API) digital 
ecosystems. Digitally enabled global logistics platforms are configured with this system logic to connect all users 
(e.g. shippers, logistics services) in order to sustain a real time operating environment. Those platforms consolidate 
demand from several shippers, optimizing the end-to-end logistics planning process and based on warehouse 
location and targeted delivery location, suggesting appropriate transport modes [9].


• Autonomous control: Digitization enables decentralized, autonomous decision making. Autonomous refers literally 
acting independently and without outside control. The machine-learning technologies (e.g. transvoyant) help to 
make predictive analytics. Daily many real-time events can be collected and analyzed from sensors, satellites, 
radar, video cameras and smartphones [2]. In logistics applications, algorithm tracks the real-time movement of 
shipments and calculates their estimated time of arrival, factoring the impact of weather conditions, port congestion 
and natural disasters. Adidas is implementing an omni channel strategy, allowing customers to buy in a number of 
ways (online and in physical store) and to get delivered in any way (at home, at the store or at a pick-up point) by 
using analytics.

• Cognition: Logistics functions undergo a fundamental change with the development of technologies such as 
artificial intelligence (AI), robots, drones for handling domestic and international movement of goods. Those 
technologies and applications such as autonomous mobile robots, unmanned ground vehicles, unmanned aerial 
vehicles and self-driving vehicles deeply impact the present and future success of logistics and improve the logistics 
industry, moreover autonomous vehicles have greater potential to reduce accident and enhance the road safety [25].
Self-driving trucks are testing by automotive manufacturers including Daimler, Volvo and Scania, Google’s 
driverless car has made a lot of progress [11], and moreover Uber realized the first delivery operation with 
driverless autonomous vehicle. Amazon is exploring the viability of delivery of small parcels by drone technology 
and developing flying warehouse blimp for the large delivery. In addition, picking process with autonomous

3. Research Design


This research uses a case study methodology to evaluate the sustainability impact of digitization in logistics, which 
focuses on understanding the dynamic present within a given setting [3].  The case study is pursued within FMCG 
companies and their transport service providers in Turkey, as FMCGs have inherently been affected by the changes in 
consumer behavior, especially the rise of digital, so that they are ready to adapt quickly [22]. A descriptive 
sustainability evaluation is performed to qualitatively identify implications of digitization on the three sustainability 
dimensions of logistics: economy, environment and society as defined by the WCED [19]. The evaluation is based on 
a defined set of criteria for which identified implications are described. The social indicators can necessarily only be 
dealt with in a qualitative fashion since the digitization technologies are still being developed, whereas the other 
economy and environment indicators can be quantified through costs, energy and CO2 emissions, however all 
sustainability dimensions are qualitatively evaluated in this study, the reason for this is the difficulty to collect 
representative data. The criteria are obtained from studying relevant literature as well as expert opinions as a

comprehensive sustainability evaluation of digitization in logistics has not been performed yet and also existing studies 
on sustainability dimensions are based more on transport rather than on logistics [21]. An aspect has been selected 
valid to become a criterion if a digitization in logistics related sustainability implication has been associated with the 
aspect, see Table 1. At the end, 23 relevant criteria are determined, where 11 out of 23 indicate the economic 
dimension, 6 criteria point to the environmental dimension and the rest of 6 criteria refer the social dimension of 
sustainability. In order to evaluate the impact of digitization from logistics perspective, the aforementioned digitization
characteristics are also considered while deciding on the listed aspects.


4. Case Study


After determining a list of criteria for sustainability impact of digitization in logistics, a case study is pursued among 
FMCG companies and transport service providers. For this study, four FMCG companies and two service providers 
were selected as they are investing in digital transformation and adapting the last digital technologies and applications 
in their processes and operations [4] and they are also cooperating each other for logistics activities. The following
research question was asked every company logistics expert to fulfill the evaluation table. 


“How do you evaluate the sustainability impact of digitization in logistics processes and operations in respect to 
digitization characteristics of logistics?” Please indicate your evaluation with the following statements on a 5-point 
relative impact scale: + less/poor ++ moderate +++ high/excellent, no impact, n/a no available evidence yet.


The evaluation process is pursued first of all with the remote session and the logistics expert of each company 
received the research question by email and fulfill the table in order to assess own perception, then all experts were 
invited to participate in a Delphi panel for achieving consensus on evaluation of sustainability impact of digitization. 
Their task was to sort, analyze and evaluate listed criteria and recommend of the most impacted sustainability criteria 
of digitization with at least two-rounds. They came to consensus with respect to sustainability impact and digitization 
characteristics of logistics, as seen in Table 2. 


5. Result and Conclusion


This study explored the sustainability impact of digitization in logistics and also answered what are the digitization 
characters and associated technologies in logistics network, how the adoption of digitization changed the logistics 
processes and which benefits have been obtained through digitization. The most existing literatures pointed out the 
sustainability implications of digitization from solely transport perspective and they failed to employ a broad case of 
logistics. Therefore, this study represents a new approach to understand the sustainability implications from logistics 
perspective. Digitization in logistics has still not reached the maturity level, as it is still in an early maturation phase. 
For this reason, sustainability implications can be improved and changed over the years with the maturity level of 
digitization. 


The study result showed that the using digital technologies and applications in logistics within FMCG companies 
and transport service providers had a huge sustainability impact, especially the sustainability impact of digitization 
with respect of economic implication was more important than the other dimensions (see Fig. 2), although evaluation 
of some impacts of criteria were unclear from participants. In terms of logistics cost, delivery time, delay, inventory, 
reliability and flexibility issues, a great potential of digitization in logistics can be seen. Beside this, study showed that 


Fig. 2. Sustainability implications of digitization in logistics


8 Kayikci / Procedia Manufacturing 00 (2017) 000–000


the social implications of digitization (improved health outcomes, lover accident rates) have generally poor impact.
Safety and health matters could be improved with the digitization in logistics, whereas digitization was seen as 
potential threats with respect to labor patterns, therefore the acceptance of fully digitization was also less. The 
environmental implications of digitization had most impacts on reducing waste, pollution and emission of greenhouse 
gases. Digitization is expected to create far more value for society than economy, in this instance, businesses, 
regulators and policy-makers will need to collaborate to maximize value for business and wider society [10].


The study has limitations that restrict the generalizability of the results, as the study were conducted using only six 
digitization characteristics of logistics as well as Delphi study was pursued with the participation of six companies.
Furthermore, quantitative part is missing in the study which was assessed only qualitatively on the three sustainability 
dimensions: economy, environment and society.
