Abstract: 


Digitally-enabled automated business solutions have the capacity to transform the economies of less 


developed regions. Indeed, the penetration of web-enabled automated business systems amongst small 


firms in less developed regions is a good indicator of the health of an emerging digitally-enabled 


economy. These technologies open up new markets and, through the effective control of supply chain 


logistics, create new efficiencies which enable these firms to compete. This research explores current e-


readiness trends concerning small to medium size enterprises in the Western Balkan region, a region 


under-represented in the recent literature. It focuses attention on three main factors which appear in the 


literature: government incentives, physical location and cost. The study concludes that the role of the 


emerging technologies and the Internet is reshaping the business model of the enterprises in the region 


and draws conclusion about important influencing factors. 


Keywords: Control and Automation to Improve Stability, Managing the Introduction of Technological 


Change to Improve Stability, SME-oriented Automation.

1. INTRODUCTION 


Digitally-enabled online business automation is transforming 


the way SMEs are engaging in business across supply chain 


and in social networks comprising customers, regulators and 


other trading partners. For example, Rasel (2016) showed 


how organizations using internet-based services to drive 


efficiencies through better communications and control of 


relations with customers and suppliers. In spite of the 


importance of these technologies as an engine for economic 


development and regional stability, few studies have reported 


on the Balkan Peninsula. This paper reports a study of 
specific factors influencing internet-based business systems 


automation penetration in the western Balkans, and tests a 


number of hypotheses to understand in factors reported in the 


literature are present in this regional case. 





2. AUTOMATED DIGITAL SYSTEMS & SMES 


OECD (OECD 2018b) reports that the focus on internet-


based business varies across different economies in the 


European zone. However, most SMEs in this region are using 


this automation and control technology to innovate their 


business models, especially by using social media to engage 


with their customer base and exploit market opportunities. 


Social media enables SMEs to engage with more end users in 


a shorter period. Bouwman et al. (2018) reported similar 


findings in an empirical study of 338 European SMEs 


actively using web-enabled social business with big data to 


innovate their business model. The study explored whether or 


not this tendency is also found in the Western Balkans. 





Ketikidis et al. (2008) confirmed in later reports by the World 


Bank (2015) explored the usage of EDI in railways across the 


Balkan region and found out that is quite low. Also, OECD 


(OECD 2018a) presented evidence that the use of EDI in the 


Western Balkans is low in comparison to other regions. Web-


enabled business solutions are perceived by some as a driver 


of cost reductions, especially in countries where access to 


Internet is easier in comparison to countries which are having 


difficulties in adoption by enterprises and people which is 


turning to be an evolutionary manner instead of being a 


revolutionary approach (EBRD 2018), (Pavic 2011), a 


situation especially true in countries outside the European 


Union where the infrastructure is not well developed and the 


government are not giving incentives to help small 


enterprises to use the advantage of the Internet.  





OECD (OECD 2018a;) reported business registration of the 


Balkan region showing an increasing tendency of small 


enterprises to register as individual businesses and limited 


liability companies, which in turn implies that business 


arrangements in the region are becoming more normalised 


and formalized. Unlike SMEs in Europe, most enterprises in 


the report are owned and managed by a single person and 


investments on technology are mainly perceived as costs and 


not as benefits.

1. INTRODUCTION 


Digitally-enabled online business automation is transforming

specific factors influencing internet-based business systems

2. AUTOMATED DIGITAL SYSTEMS & SMES 


OECD (OECD 2018b) reports that the focus on internet-


based business varies across different economies in the 


European zone. However, most SMEs in this region are using 


this automation and control technology to innovate their 


business models, especially by using social media to engage 


with their customer base and exploit market opportunities. 


Social media enables SMEs to engage with more end users in 


a shorter period. Bouwman et al. (2018) reported similar 


findings in an empirical study of 338 European SMEs 


actively using web-enabled social business with big data to 


innovate their business model. The study explored whether or 


not this tendency is also found in the Western Balkans. 





Ketikidis et al. (2008) confirmed in later reports by the World 


Bank (2015) explored the usage of EDI in railways across the 


Balkan region and found out that is quite low. Also, OECD 


(OECD 2018a) presented evidence that the use of EDI in the 


Western Balkans is low in comparison to other regions. Web-


enabled business solutions are perceived by some as a driver 


of cost reductions, especially in countries where access to 


Internet is easier in comparison to countries which are having 


difficulties in adoption by enterprises and people which is 


turning to be an evolutionary manner instead of being a 


revolutionary approach (EBRD 2018), (Pavic 2011), a 


situation especially true in countries outside the European 


Union where the infrastructure is not well developed and the 


government are not giving incentives to help small 


enterprises to use the advantage of the Internet.  





OECD (OECD 2018a;) reported business registration of the 


Balkan region showing an increasing tendency of small 


enterprises to register as individual businesses and limited 


liability companies, which in turn implies that business 


arrangements in the region are becoming more normalised 


and formalized. Unlike SMEs in Europe, most enterprises in 


the report are owned and managed by a single person and 


investments on technology are mainly perceived as costs and 


not as benefits.

In a major early study of technology investment and 


innovation, Pek-Hooi Soh et al. (2004) found that the 


physical location of a firm was vital for the success of 


business ventures generally, and shaped their use of 


information technology as a strategic lever as reflected in the 


customer value preposition. As SMEs recognise the need to 


use even basic web solutions such as e-mails, web-pages and 


e-commerce systems, they innovate new opportunities for 


small-scale local enterprise thus successfully competing with 


bigger enterprises without a need on having offices in several 


places, thus mitigating disadvantages associated with poor 


geographic location (Sun et al. 2012). Ratnasingam (2008) 


mentioned the fact that with the growth of e-commerce 


known as interaction business-to-consumer (B2C) firms are 


gaining new customers and are being able to compete with 


larger firm, even though there are still reluctances of 


customers using e-commerce instead of shopping physically. 


Other research reveals that not all enterprises are using 


information technology to achieve their goals and strategic 


direction. For example, in a major study of EDI penetration 


in Kosovo supply-chain networks Stapleton (2011) reported 


that about two thirds of firms had not adopted this digital 


supply chain automation system to control the flow of 


business information across partner networks. Whilst this 


study did not report on physical location factors, it did show 


that subsidiarity was an important factor influencing EDI 


adoption amongst large firms such as banks. 





Government influence through incentives has also been 


reported as an important factor shaping the e-readiness of 


small firms. In this way, a research by Hong et al. (2016) 


wrote about the necessity of government grant to promote 


innovation and efficiency, which was found to be a positive 


connection among innovativeness in terms of e-readiness and 


grants by governments. 


Tsai et al. (2011) reported that the implementation of digital 


business solutions (in this case ERP) involves significant 


risks and have a very low success rate impacted by important 


contextual factors, especially post-conflict countries. In a 


research by Kryeziu and Imeri (2016) a chronology of 


governmental incentives and investments in terms of creating 


a better interaction among tax administration and businesses 


showed an easier way of using e-services and a high 


acceptance of users, in this case businesses.  





3. RESEARCH QUESTIONS, THEORY AND 


HYPOTHESES 





This short literature review gave rise to three research 


questions which explore a narrow range of possible factors: 





RQ1: To what extent does physical location of SMEs in the 


Western Balkan region influence the penetration of web-


enabled business automation solutions? 





RQ2: To what extent do government incentives influence the 


penetration of web-enabled business automation solutions 


amongst SMEs in the western Balkan region? 





RQ3: To what extent do factors associated with cost control 


influence the penetration of web-enabled business automation 


solutions amongst SMEs in the western Balkan region? 





From these research questions and the literature survey it was 


possible to derive a number of testable hypotheses for which 


data could be gathered, as follows: 





H1: Factors associated with the physical location of SMEs in 


the Western Balkan region are perceived by key decision 


makers in these SMEs to be correlated with the adoption of 


online business automation technology. 





H2: Factors associated with appropriate government 


incentives for SMEs in the Western Balkan region are 


perceived by key decision makers in these SMEs to be 


correlated with the adoption of online business automation 


technology. 





H3: If H1 and H2 are true, factors associated with the 


physical location of SMEs in the Western Balkan region are 


perceived by key decision makers in these SMEs to be 


correlated with the availability (or otherwise) of appropriate 


incentives from government in relation to the adoption of 


online business automation technology. 





H4: Cost factors for SMEs in the Western Balkan region are 


perceived by key decision makers in SMEs to be correlated 


with the adoption of online business automation technology. 





H5: If H4 is true, cost factors for SMEs in the Western 


Balkan region are perceived by key decision makers in these 


SMEs to be correlated with incentives from government in 


relation to the adoption of online business automation 


technology. 





4. OVERVIEW OF RESEARCH DESIGN 


This research used an online survey based upon the above 


hypotheses to gather evidence both for the theory and on 


SMEs and decision maker profiles. The survey employed a 


self-administered, structured questionnaire using mono-


method (single data collection technique). The targeted 


population was key decision makers in SMEs and response 


rates were 67% (94 respondents from 140 targeted 


companies). These were approached through by the 


researchers based on data found at opendatakosovo.org and 


arbk.rks-gov.net. The study therefore suffers from a non-


response bias of 33%. The next section presents survey 


findings. 





5. FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION 


4.1. Profile of the Respondents 


The first part of the questionnaire gathered details of key 


decision makers and their firms. Gender breakdown was 75% 


males and 25% of the respondents were females. This was 


consistent with results in other recent reports prepared by 


international agencies (OECD 2018a; ASK, 2018). Whilst the

perceived by key decision makers in these SMEs to be 


correlated with the adoption of online business automation 


technology. 





H3: If H1 and H2 are true, factors associated with the 


physical location of SMEs in the Western Balkan region are 


perceived by key decision makers in these SMEs to be 


correlated with the availability (or otherwise) of appropriate 


incentives from government in relation to the adoption of 


online business automation technology. 





H4: Cost factors for SMEs in the Western Balkan region are 


perceived by key decision makers in SMEs to be correlated 


with the adoption of online business automation technology. 





H5: If H4 is true, cost factors for SMEs in the Western 


Balkan region are perceived by key decision makers in these 


SMEs to be correlated with incentives from government in

4. OVERVIEW OF RESEARCH DESIGN 


This research used an online survey based upon the above 


hypotheses to gather evidence both for the theory and on 


SMEs and decision maker profiles. The survey employed a 


self-administered, structured questionnaire using mono-


method (single data collection technique). The targeted 


population was key decision makers in SMEs and response 


rates were 67% (94 respondents from 140 targeted 


companies). These were approached through by the 


researchers based on data found at opendatakosovo.org and 


arbk.rks-gov.net. The study therefore suffers from a non-


response bias of 33%. The next section presents survey 


findings. 





5. FINDINGS AND DISCUSSION 


4.1. Profile of the Respondents 


The first part of the questionnaire gathered details of key 


decision makers and their firms. Gender breakdown was 75% 


males and 25% of the respondents were females. This was 


consistent with results in other recent reports prepared by 


international agencies (OECD 2018a; ASK, 2018). Whilst the 





survey did not explore these findings in further detail, it can 


be reasonably speculated on the basis of academic studies 


that these high rates of males in decision making are due to 


the bureaucratic procedures and culture in the firms, possibly 


associated with the transitioning nature of the economy from 


centrally-planned to market economy (Cule & Fulton 2005), 


Samolienko (2008)). There may also be prejudices associated 


with a Kosovar patriarchal culture which act as obstacles 


against women leading an enterprise (Saltemarsh (2002), 


Slzuki & Albani (2004)). There are also barriers created by 


the recent wars which affected predominantly the way of 


doing business and sustainability of the enterprises and which 


may be reflected in this gender bias. The post-conflict 


situation may also explain the age-profiles of decision makers 


in the sample. Respondents between 25-34 years old made up 


50% of the sample. Respondents aged between 35-44 


occupied 16% of the whole population, whereas the group 


less than 25 years old and 44-54 years old together account 


for 13.8%. Respondents between ages of 55-64 comprised 


only 6.4%. This again is consistent with other reports 


showing a tendency of younger people who have accessed 


higher education and/or have entrepreneurship spirit to create 


their own enterprise (OECD 2018a; ASK, 2018).  


4.2. Profile of Digital Business Systems Penetration in SMEs 


The study made few assumptions about the level of 


penetration of various digital technologies in the sample. 


population and data was gathered to profile the nature and 


extent of penetration of these systems and technologies, 


including basic technology like Personal Computers, e-mail, 


intranet or other solutions.  





All respondents used personal computers and e-mails but 


only 54.3% used a company intranet for internal purposes 


and only 2.1% are using other software’s such as Enterprise 


Resource Planning, EDI or other solutions. Which is also 


connected with the fact that small enterprises do not perceive 


investments in ERP or EDI as a strategic approach. The 


findings for EDI-based automated business communications 


suggest little change in the last ten years for EDI penetration, 


a subject which requires further study as it suggests that these 


firms are at a significant disadvantage to SMEs in other 


regions, especially in relation to supply chain efficiency, 


business controls and productivity. They are also not in a 


position to avail of emerging technology in regulation such as 


XBRL and PEPPOL which could make it difficult for the 


firms to access business opportunities overseas. 





These findings align with Komijani and Mahmoodzadeh 


(2009) which showed that, ten years ago, developing 


countries are trying to pursue technologic changes more, 


especially countries which are in South East Europe but that 


it is very difficult and some regions are at a distinct 


disadvantage compared to others. Studies have especially 


highlighted the difficulties for SMEs in African countries 


(Kayisire and Wei 2016) and this study of the Western 


Balkans suggest that the region may be experiencing similar 


structural barriers.  





In spite of the reported difficulties associated with adopting a 


full suite of digital business solutions, 98% of respondents 


believed that the Internet and related digital services could 


play a significant role in lowering costs and adding value to 


their supply chain activities. 





Table 1 summarizes influencing factors the SMEs decision 


makers reported for use business-based internet capabilities 


and related information technology services. In line with this, 


it can be said that the need of being and sustaining 


competitive in the market is perceived with the changes that 


they have to follow in terms of using new technologies. 








Table 1.  Summary of ICT influencing factors at SMEs 


Summary of ICT influencing factors at SMEs Results 


1. Internet as a very important tool 53.19% 


2. Internet as an important tool 31.91% 


3. Internet is not important tool or has 


marginal importance 


5.32% 


4.  Using ICT to communicate with existing

10. Using Internet to keep up with 


competition 


95% 


11. Using ICT to streamline their operation  76% 


12.   





The finding of current research regarding the influence of 


ICT usage are in line with the findings of different academics 


such as Hervas-Oliver et al. (2016), Aslesen and Harirchi 


(2015) where they stated that the use of innovative 


approaches through the Internet helped organizations to 


develop internally and externally, especially by easy access to 


raw materials, products and their customers to use the 


benefits within their supply chain activities which is also 


stated by reports of different institutions (OECD 2018b; 


EBRD 2018) when it comes to the use of the Internet with the 


influence of external factors. 





Current and future plans on using innovative solutions 


offered by digital business capabilities 





Current research measured also the current and future plans 


on using innovative solutions, where in table 2 a summary is 


presented.  


Table 2.  Summary of current and future plans 


Summary of current and future plans Results 


1. Possession of web page  88.3% 


2. Plans on having web page 8.5% 


3. Not having a web page 3.2% 






32 Albert Aliu  et al. / IFAC PapersOnLine 52-25 (2019) 29–34





4.  Purchasing goods/services online 63.83% 


5. Selling goods/services online 42.55% 


6. Supplying information about products 


online 


94.68% 


7. Not supplying information about products 


online 


4.26% 


8. Planning to share information about 


products in the near future 


1.06% 


9. Bidding for contracts via Internet 78.72% 





The low levels of selling online from the company 


perspective it is connected with the fact that the infrastructure 


is not well-developed to support selling online as well as the 


fact that customers are loyal when it comes to purchasing 


goods/services since they prefer purchasing offline (Roy et al. 


2017). However, since most of the respondents possess web 


page they stated that they supply information about the 


products via the Internet while a low percentage of 


respondents are still not sharing product information via the 


Internet and few of them are planning in the near future to 


share information. The current findings are not in line with 


the finding of Guha et al. (2018) where having a web page is 


considered as a main source of interaction with different 


opportunities offered by the Internet. 


Furthermore, the current use of the Internet by enterprises is 


foreseen to have a huge impact when it comes to public 


bidding. In line with this, the respondents of the current 


research stated that they bid for contract via the Internet, 


which is considered a good indicator to overcome informal 


activities (Cule and Fulton 2005) as well as the use of 


electronic procurement which is the main way of applying for 


public contract starting from 2019. 








The use of online systems to interact with third parties 





Interaction among enterprises is considered to be a key-


success factor. In this way, the table 3 below summarizes the 


use of online systems to interact with third parties. 


Summary of usage of ICT to interact with third 


parties 


Results 


1. Using Internet to find new suppliers 87.23% 


2. Using Internet to build business 


connections 


94.68% 


3. Monitoring online visitors 44.68% 


3. Online subsidiary  67% 


4.  Planning to have online subsidiary 2.13% 


5. Not planning to have online subsidiary 30.85% 





In line with the table above, Rasel (2016)  stated that 


organizations are becoming more punctual by the use of 


Internet services, mainly to be in touch with customers and 


suppliers which is in line with the current findings. Likewise, 


the statistics in terms of visitors play a crucial role when it 


comes to the analysis within a business. Nevertheless, the 


low levels of using Internet as a monitoring tool bring back to 


the findings of Aliu and Halili (2013) where there was no 


usage of advanced information systems which is offering the 


analytical tools as well.  


Contrary, the non-usage of online subsidiary is considered as 


a lost potential, since according to the findings of Sun et al. 


(2012) small enterprises should use the power of the Internet  


to compete with bigger enterprises without a need on having 


offices in several places. 





5. DISCUSSION OF EVIDENCE FOR HYPOTHESES 





Based on the analysis through SPSS regarding the 


correlations among variables it was found out that some of 


the hypotheses are accepted and some are rejected. A 


summary is presented below, and a detailed table of the 


results can be found as appendix of this paper.

correlation among two variables and the 2-tailed significance 


is greater than 0.05 where there can be concluded that there is 


no significant correlation among those two variables, and the 


hypothesis H1 is rejected. 


In addition, correlation among good location is vital to 


business success and government should give more 


incentives to help firms get on the Internet, there is weak 


positive correlation among variables and the 2-tailed 


significance is greater than 0.05 where there can be 


concluded that there is no significant correlation among those 


two variables, and the hypothesis H2 is rejected. 


Further, good location is vital to business success and 


benefits of the Internet tend to out-weigh its costs, it can be 


seen that there is a weak negative correlation among two 


variables and the 2-tailed significance is less than 0.05 where 


there can be concluded that there is correlation among two 


variables at the 95% significant.  


The hypothesis H3 is accepted at the 95% significance level 


which means that good location and Internet tend to outweigh 


its cost are indirectly related, due to its weak negative 


correlation which is related to what is stated in literature. 


In regards to the variable customers increasingly expect us to

5. CONCLUSION  


The main aim of the current research was to provide a 


descriptive analysis as well as to test the hypothesis about the 


impact of the Internet usage at SMEs. With this in mind the 


study posed three research questions which can be answered 


briefly in light of the hypotheses and findings. 





RQ1: To what extent does physical location of SMEs in the 


Western Balkan region influence the penetration of web-


enabled business automation solutions? 


There was no evidence to suggest a correlation between the 


physical location of firms and their adoption of these 


systems. This is an encouraging finding as it suggests that 


these technologies could help “level the playing field” for 


adopting SMEs. This could be a significant driver of 


competiveness, especially for firms in marginalised, outlier 


regions in the Western Balkans. It can be reasonably 


speculated that any government incentives designed to 


actively support SMEs across the region to adoption online 


business systems could have a major positive impact on 


economic activity. These could include infrastructure 


investments as well as other incentives The next question 


explored this possibility. 





RQ2: To what extent do government incentives influence the 


penetration of web-enabled business automation solutions 


amongst SMEs in the western Balkan region? 


There was no evidence that these incentives were available to 


firms, suggesting that the government may be overlooking 


the role of digital business automation systems as potential 


levers for economic growth. Previous reported case studies 


have revealed significant capacity for innovation and 


competitiveness in Kosovo across the high-tech sector 


(Stapleton (2019); Kealy & Stapleton (2015)). Findings for 


H5 suggest that any incentives which would alleviate cost 


barriers to technology investment would have a particularly 


strong impact, such as tax breaks, attractive credit facilities or 


other incentives.  





RQ3: To what extent do factors associated with the control of 


costs influence the penetration of web-enabled business 


automation solutions amongst SMEs in the western Balkan 


region? 


The evidence strongly suggested that cost were a major factor 


in technology investment decision in the region. SMEs 


reported that they recognised the innovative capacity of these 


solutions as well as using the technology to obtain 


competitive information driving strategic choices. There was 


evidence that costs were related to the geographical location 


of the SME, again suggesting that government incentives 


prioritising certain geographical locations are advised. 





Being online is a matter of survival in the 21st century and 


this study reveals a positive picture in terms of the openness 


and readiness of many SMEs in the western Balkans to adopt 


and exploit these new technologies. On the other hand the 


barriers to adoption are significant and can be reduced by 


clear enacted government policies, supported by targeted 


international aid. The findings of this study suggest that such 


policies will democratise online access, and create 


sustainable balanced development across the region.
