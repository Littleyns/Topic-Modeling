This study focuses on examining client citizenship behaviors (CCBs) from a psychological contract perspective in 
enterprise systems (ES) vendor–client relationships. Using polynomial modeling to capture the discrepancy be-
tween expected obligations and delivered fulfillments, this stud unpacks psychological contract and investigates 
the impacts of psychological contract under-fulfillment, fulfillment, and over-fulfillment on CCBs. The results show 
that both under-fulfillment and over-fulfillment of psychological contract are negatively related to CCBs. CCBs 
are shown to be higher when expected obligation and delivered fulfillment are both high than when both are low. 
The theoretical contributions and practical implications are discussed.   


1. Introduction 


Client participation has been regarded as a critical factor to the 
success of enterprise systems (ES) project [1,2]. Although many ES 
vendors have succeeded in promoting their clients to participate in ES 
projects through contractual regulations [3,4], it is still challenging for 
ES vendors to encourage their clients to exhibit a series of client citi-
zenship behaviors (CCBs) which are voluntary and not explicitly detailed 
in formal contracts [5]. CCBs, including providing ES usage feedbacks, 
recommending ES to partners, and helping partners with ES imple-
mentation, are critical for ES vendors to achieve competitive advantage 
[6]. Specifically, feedbacks from clients are helpful in finetuning soft-
ware modules to better integrate multiple business processes [7]. Cli-
ents’ recommendations assist ES vendors in promoting their products 
because opinions from a neutral party are more convincing [8]. Helping 
behaviors are more effective in transferring domain knowledge and 
achieving ES project success [9]. Conceivably, it is imperative for ES 
vendors to understand how to increase the willingness of their clients to 
conduct CCBs in achieving the success of ES projects. 


As contended by literature, citizenship behavior is discretionary and 
voluntary in nature, which is free from being explicitly regulated [10]. 
Instead of formal written contract, psychological contract, which contains 
a set of unwritten beliefs and expectations concerning reciprocal 


obligations [11], is widely considered as an effective enabler of citi-
zenship behaviors [12–14]. In the context of ES project, the ven-
dor–client relationship is a social exchange relationship where both 
parties pursue mutual benefits with the principle of reciprocity [15]. The 
social exchange between an ES vendor and its client creates a set of 
norms—beliefs and perceptions of obligations—that establish a psy-
chological contract of client [16,17]. From the clients’ perspective, cli-
ents tend to behave based on their own implicit beliefs rather than explicit 
complex contractual rules that are impractical to execute [18,19]. Once 
the psychological contracts get fulfilled, these beliefs can intrinsically 
motivate CCBs based on the norm of reciprocity in social exchange re-
lationships [20,21]. However, the role of psychological contracts in 
influencing CCBs in ES projects has rarely been mentioned. Therefore, 
this study attempts to scrutinize the influencing mechanisms of psy-
chological contract fulfillment status on CCBs in ES projects. 


Extant literature has widely explored the influence of breach or 
violation of psychological contract on citizenship behaviors (e.g., [12, 
13,22]). While findings of these studies have indeed extended our un-
derstandings of the role of psychological contract in citizenship behav-
iors, they still share some limitations. First, there is a paucity of research 
concentrating on inter-organizational contexts to empirically examine 
citizenship behaviors from the psychological contract perspective, given 
that previous research mainly focused on intra-organizational contexts

(e.g. [12,14,23,24],). Yet, the literature indicates that, in a buyer–sup-
plier relationship, the buyer maintains a set of expectations toward the 
supplier’s obligations, which introduces a distinct psychological 
element into the contractual relations [11,25,26]. This exchange of 
obligation supports the existence of a psychological contract between 
these two parties. In an ES project, the exchange between an ES vendor 
and its client involves implied obligation of reciprocity for mutual 
benefits [11], which thereby establishes a psychological contract be-
tween them. Given this, it is appropriate and necessary to apply psy-
chological contract as a lens to investigate the cognitive and 
psychological aspects of managing CCBs in ES vendor–client relation-
ships [11,25]. 


Second, although many studies have explored the effect of the under- 
fulfillment of psychological contract (e.g., [16,27–29]), few studies have 
investigated its over-fulfillment [29]. In an ES project, over-fulfilling 
obligations may come at a huge cost to ES vendors due to complex ES 
implementation processes. Meanwhile, maintaining cooperative re-
lationships in ES projects involves more resources and energy, for 
example, building buffers into contracts to accommodate scope changes 
and investing time in building good relationships [19]. Furthermore, 
over-fulfillment may lead to clients’ perception of violation because they 
suspect ES vendors going beyond the boundary such as deliberately 
accessing business intelligence [30,31]. Specifically, when ES vendors 
develop an overly close bond with staff from client firms to foster 
knowledge sharing, it may induce clients’ concern of misappropriating 
their intellectual assets held by staff. Thus, comparing with 
under-fulfillment of psychological contract, its over-fulfillment deserves 
equal attention regarding its influence in ES projects. 


Third, scholars normally operationalize breach and fulfillment of 
psychological contract by reflecting the extent to which a firm has kept 
its promises (e.g., [32]), omitting the joint effects of the components that 
comprise breach and fulfillment (i.e., expected obligations and delivered 
fulfillments) on citizenship behaviors [33]. In ES projects, both expected 
obligations and delivered fulfillments are critical factors that influence 
clients’ behaviors. As ES implementation is a knowledge-intensive 
project that requires ES vendors’ sustained support, clients believe ES 
vendors are obligated to perform certain behaviors to ensure the success 
of ES projects. These expected obligations involve a clear understanding 
of ES vendors’ roles and responsibilities that clients are likely to react to. 
The final delivered fulfillments joint with expected obligations ulti-
mately determine the behaviors that clients respond with. Hence, it is 
necessary to take an expanded view of psychological contract by 
considering the distinction between obligations and associated fulfill-
ments [33]. 


Addressing these research gaps is practically meaningful and theo-
retically important. Practically, although legal contracts exist between 
ES vendors and clients, written obligations cannot cover all concerns 
from clients and must be supplemented by unwritten promises [18]. 
Because ES implementation implies an unwritten set of expectations 
from clients, psychological contracts ubiquitously exist in ES ven-
dor–client relationships. However, CCBs are free from explicit contrac-
tual regulations but can be intrinsically motivated by fulfillment of 
psychological contracts. Therefore, it is important for ES vendors to pay 
attention to the influence of psychological contracts on CCBs in 
achieving ES project success. Theoretically, the social exchange nature 
of ES vendor–client relationship implicitly establishes psychological 
contracts between ES vendors and clients [34,35]. While IT outsourcing 
research has drawn on social exchange theory (SET) [34,35], little ac-
counts for the breach and/or fulfillment of psychological contracts that 
occur within social exchanges impacting ES vendor–client collaboration. 
By considering the distinction between expected obligations and deliv-
ered fulfillments, a psychological contract provides a more nuanced 
theoretical perspective to shed light on the theoretical mechanisms that 
how ES vendors’ fulfillment of expected obligations influences CCBs in 
the ES implementation context. This research contributes by employing 
SET to investigate CCBs in ES vendor–client relationships using a 


psychological contract perspective. 
Based on the clients’ perspective, this study aims to examine how 


CCBs are influenced by ES vendors’ fulfillment of their clients’ psy-
chological contracts. Specifically, we considered a full range of potential 
situations of under-fulfillment (i.e., client perceived fulfillments fall short 
of expected obligations), fulfillment (i.e., client perceived fulfillments 
match expected obligations), and over-fulfillment (i.e., client perceived 
fulfillments exceed expected obligations) of psychological contract. 
Furthermore, we compared the performance of CCBs under perfect 
fulfillment between situations in which delivered fulfillments and ex-
pected obligations are both low and both are high. By capturing the 
discrepancy between expected obligations and delivered fulfillments, 
this study enhances the understanding of CCBs in ES projects by 
considering the full range of psychological contract fulfillment situa-
tions (e.g., under-fulfillment, fulfillment, and over-fulfillment) and 
using polynomial modeling to examine the curvilinear relationships 
between psychological contract fulfillment situations and CCBs. Our 
research results suggest that both psychological contract under-fulfill-
ment and over-fulfillment are negatively associated with CCBs. We further 
observe that, in the fulfillment situation, CCBs will be higher when ful-
fillments and obligations match at a high level as opposed to when they 
match at a low level. 


2. Theoretical background and hypotheses development 


2.1. Social exchange theory 


Social exchange theory was initially applied to examine interper-
sonal exchanges that are not purely economic [36]. This theory defines 
social exchange as “voluntary actions of individuals that are motivated 
by the returns they are expected to bring and typically in fact bring from 
others” ([37] p. 91). While developed at the individual level, scholars 
have extended SET to the organizational level [36,38,39]. At this level, 
SET proposes that corporate groups interact for a reward or with the 
expectation of a reward from their interaction with partners [38,40]. 
Generally, the exchange parties are interdependent and the exchange 
requires a bidirectional transaction involving reciprocity [41]. The norm 
of reciprocity that represents the “rules” governing social exchange in-
dicates the exchange as reciprocal in that, if one party supplies a benefit, 
the receiving party should respond in kind [41]. 


Social exchange theory provides a general approach for under-
standing how clients are likely to respond when they perceive their 
psychological contracts have been fulfilled or not. Because inter- 
organizational relationships, such as ES vendor–client relationships, 
are not only governed by contractual elements but also regulated by 
social norms, such as beliefs concerning reciprocity [42]. In ES ven-
dor–client relationships, an ES vendor wants to maintain its market 
share, while its client wants to successfully implement ES for operational 
efficiency. Hence, ES vendors and their clients are highly interdependent 
with mutual benefits and commitments [15]. In the course of coopera-
tion, both parties abide by the certain “rules” of exchange that guide the 
exchange processes [43]. For example, ES vendors maintain an expec-
tation of return from their clients when contributing to clients. Because 
the fulfillment status of a psychological contract may break or maintain 
the “rules” of exchange which, in turn, affects the readiness of clients to 
exchange with CCBs. In this view, we deem SET as an appropriate 
theoretical lens to examine the effects of psychological contract on CCBs. 


Social exchange theory is composed of a series of propositions that 
outline social exchange. First, the success proposition argues that, for all 
actions taken, the more often a particular action is rewarded, the more 
likely the exchange partner is to perform that action again [40]. In the 
ES vendor–client context, knowledge share between these two parties is 
reflective of this principle. The reward proposition argues that the more 
deprived the reward, the more value it gains [38]. The value proposition 
argues that the more valuable the exchange one party perceives as the 
result of an exchange, the more likely the party to perform the action

again [38]. In the ES vendor–client context, clients will engage in 
reciprocal activities in response to how valuable the actions ES vendor 
performed. The aggression proposition argues that the exchange party will 
aggressively withhold the action in the future when its action does not 
receive the expected reward or receive unexpected punishment [40]. 
Finally, the rationality proposition argues that, in choosing between ac-
tions, the exchange party will choose that which will bring a greater 
expected value of reward [40]. Hence, we argue that SET provides a 
general approach for understanding how clients are likely to respond 
upon perceiving whether their psychological contracts have been ful-
filled by their ES vendors. 


2.2. Client citizenship behavior 


Citizenship behavior was initially studied at the individual level (e. 
g., [44–47]). This individual discretionary behavior promotes the 
effective functioning of the organization but is not directly or explicitly 
recognized by the formal reward systems [48]. Gradually, researchers 
widely studied this behavior at the group level and consider citizenship 
behavior as a collective voluntary behavior that done by a group (e.g. [5, 
49–51],). Their antecedents and outcomes have been studied in diverse 
fields such as organizational behavior (e.g. [50,52],), human resource 
management (e.g. [52,53],), marketing (e.g. [54],), information systems 
(e.g. [5,55],), and leadership (e.g. [46],). Recently, scholars have 
increasingly realized that citizenship behavior might grow in a context 
[56,57] and have called for research on citizenship behaviors at the firm 
level [58]. Autry et al. [59], for example, contended citizenship be-
haviors as discretionary interfirm behavioral tactics that promote the 
effective functioning of the whole system, but are not directly or 
explicitly included in formal agreements. Based on the work of Autry 
et al. [59], Skinner et al. [60] described the development of a scale for 
measuring citizenship behavior at the firm level. In IS field, researchers 
investigated the role of citizenship behavior at various levels. Table 1 
provides an overview of recent IS research on citizenship behavior. 


In this study, we theoretically ground the concept of CCBs in prior 
studies of firm-level citizenship behavior and define CCBs as a client 
firm’s readiness to engage in extra-role behaviors that are not explicitly 
detailed in formal business contracts [57,65]. Following Groth [65]’s 
work, we conceptualize recommendations, helping other customers, and 
providing feedback as three dimensions of CCBs. Because ES vendors not 
only care about expanding their market shares but also interest in 
improving their outsourcing service quality [66]. Therefore, the three 


dimensions are citizenship behaviors that an ES vendor most valued in 
an ES vendor–client relationship. Specifically, recommendations refer to 
clients’ voluntary behavior (i.e., that which is not required by ES ven-
dors) to recommend ES products to other firms [67]. Helping other 
customers denotes a client’s discretionary engagement in constructive 
behaviors to assist other customers in implementation and ES usage 
[67]. Providing feedback refers to a client’s discretionary behaviors in 
providing valuable information, including usage feedback and related 
services, to ES vendors [68]. Given the significance of CCBs in ES ven-
dor–client relationships, it is necessary to understand how to increase a 
client’s propensity to engage in citizenship behaviors in an ES project. 


2.3. Psychological contract 


A psychological contract is a set of beliefs about reciprocal obliga-
tions between two parties in an exchange relationship [69,70]. Unlike 
expectations, psychological contracts are based on perceived promises 
of reciprocity and are established when one party believes that the other 
party is obligated to perform certain behaviors [71]. Hence, researchers 
have argued that each party in a relationship possesses a unique psy-
chological contract based on its own understanding of the reciprocal 
obligations [19]. Central to psychological contract theory is the 
perception of breach. Psychological contract breach is a continuum 
ranging from under-fulfillment to fulfillment, to over-fulfillment [72]. 
Under-fulfillment occurs when one party perceives another party’s 
insufficient fulfillment of obligations within a psychological contract 
[73]. Fulfillment happens when one party perceives that obligations 
have been sufficiently fulfilled by another party [73]. Over-fulfillment 
happens when one party perceives delivered fulfillments exceed prom-
ised obligations [74]. 


Most of the prior literature focuses psychological contract at the 
individual level of analysis (e.g., [28,75–78]), while some studies have 
extended it to relationships at the firm level (e.g. [11,19,25,79–82],). 
Blancero and Ellram [79] noted that the key aspect of psychological 
contract allows it to be applied in inter-organizational contexts, such as 
relationships between buyers and suppliers. In a buyer–supplier rela-
tionship, a psychological contract is the conceptualization of an ex-
change agreement between the buyer and the supplier in which one 
party maintains a set of beliefs toward the other party’s obligations [25]. 
In an ES vendor–client relationship, clients hold beliefs about what their 
ES vendors are obligated to provide and beliefs about how well the ES 
vendors have fulfilled the obligations [19]. To make clear the critical 
customer–supplier obligations in an IT outsourcing relationship, Koh 
et al. [19] developed and empirically validated their research models of 
customer and supplier obligations in the context of IT outsourcing. 
Through qualitative analysis, Koh et al. [19] identified six major com-
ponents of what clients believe are ES vendors’ obligations in IT 
outsourcing. We draw on their finalized set of validated obligations to 
develop our research model. These components are well established in 
literature to reflect psychological contract in IS outsourcing relation-
ship, which is consistent with the relationship in our research context 
[19]. These components are evaluated from the perspective of clients to 
reflect their opinions on key aspects in IT outsourcing relationships. 
Particularly, clients can evaluate to what extent they believe that an ES 
vendor should take these obligations and how well the ES vendor fulfills 
these obligations. Table 2 shows an ES vendor’s basic obligations that 
constitute the basis of psychological contracts in an ES vendor–client. 


2.4. Hypotheses development 


Under-fulfillment of psychological contracts occurs when clients 
perceive a discrepancy between what they think ES vendors are obli-
gated to provide and what they actually receive. In ES vendor–client 
relationships, clients seek to maintain equality between their costs and 
beliefs in the exchange relationship [83]. However, from the clients’ 
perceptive, the discrepancy between delivered fulfillments and expected

obligations creates inequality in the social exchange [84]. In this sense, 
as long as clients perceive that they have adequately met their obliga-
tions to their ES vendors, clients may feel shortchanged by ES vendors’ 
failure to fulfill their obligations. Thus, clients will incline to rebalance 
this unfair social exchange by reducing the extent of their voluntary 
actions (i.e., CCBs). Besides, obligations are based on beliefs in promises 
or debts [11]. ES vendors’ failure to comply with their obligations may 
foster the clients’ perception that ES vendors not give serious consid-
eration to the promises of ES projects success and are thereby not 
dependable. This leads to negative beliefs on the client’s behalf about 
the integrity of ES vendors, and, therefore, inflicts severe damage on the 
norms of reciprocity in the social exchange relationships. Given this, the 
under-fulfillment of a psychological contract by ES vendors may affect 
not only what clients have expected to receive but also what clients feel 
obligated to offer in return. In such cases, clients may feel much less 
obligated to perform citizenship behaviors because the obligations in the 
psychological contracts are no longer valued. Hence, we predict that 
clients will withhold CCBs if they feel the psychological contract has not 
been adequately fulfilled. 


Hypothesis 1. The CCBs will be reduced to the extent that clients 
perceive that the obligations comprising their psychological contracts 
have been under-fulfilled by their ES vendors. 


When delivered fulfillments exceed expected obligations, clients 
receive more inducements than they expected. Such excess also creates 
inequality in social exchange. SET suggests that clients are motivated to 
engage in CCBs when they perceive that their relationships with ES 
vendors are based on the foundation of fair social exchanges [12]. To 
maintain equality in the reciprocal exchange, clients tend to reciprocate 
the exceeded fulfillments by increasing their CCBs. Besides, prior 
research suggests that excess increases client satisfaction [65,72]; the 
more satisfied the clients are with the degree to which their ES vendors 
are “living up to their obligations”, the more reciprocal CCBs the clients 
are likely to respond with. Thus, as clients receive more benefits from 
their ES vendors, they perceive that the obligations comprising their 
psychological contracts are highly valued and that their ES vendors are 
therefore highly dependable. This leads to clients’ positive assessment of 
beliefs about their ES vendors’ benevolence and integrity. In this sense, 
clients will more likely respond in kind in terms of CCBs to maintain a 
good relationship with their ES vendors. Taken together, these argu-
ments about the over-fulfillment of a psychological contract lead us to 
posit the following: 


Hypothesis 2. The CCBs will increase to the extent that clients 
perceive the obligations comprising their psychological contracts have 
been over-fulfilled by their ES vendors. 


Psychological contract fulfillment is conceptualized as a continuum 
where received inducements and promises range from low to high levels 
with the stipulation that received inducements equal those promised. As 
clients perceive their ES vendors’ obligations—such as clear authority 
structures and dedicated project staffing—to be critical to the success of 
the ES projects and difficult to accomplish, clients tend to believe that 
their ES vendors are fulfilling an ambitious standard [19]. Compared 
with a low level of obligation that is fulfilled, the higher the level of an 
obligation being fulfilled, the more certain the clients believe their ES 
vendors have fulfilled an ambitious commitment to them. For example, 
clients may believe that their ES vendors are more obligated to assign 
adequate staff dedicated to the project and lower the staff turnover 
during the project than to work as a team with them. Compared with 
fulfilling the obligation of working as a team, fulfilling the obligation of 
dedicated project staffing is more likely to enhance the clients’ 
perception of fulfilling an ambitious commitment. Therefore, clients will 
willingly reciprocate the high level of delivered fulfillment with more 
CCBs. Additionally, higher levels of obligations fulfilled will generate 
higher levels of perceived organizational support from ES vendors, 
which give impetus to clients to reciprocate this benefit with higher 
performances of CCBs [23]. Following this logic, we posit the following: 


Hypothesis 3. The CCBs will be higher when expected obligations 
match delivered fulfillments at a high level than match at a low level. 


3. Research methods 


3.1. Data collection 


As the variables we studied are primarily psychological concepts, it is 
more effective to apply a survey design to capture the key characteristics 
in which we are interested. A survey was conducted in collaboration 
with one of the largest ES service suppliers, BS Company, in the Chinese 
garment industry. We chose to collect data from its client firms whose ES 
services are at the post-implementation stage. The post-implementation 
stage is suitable and helpful for our research because, by this stage in the 
process and relationship, clients can comprehensively evaluate the ES 
vendor’s fulfillment of obligations with respect to the entirety of the ES 
implementation service. Furthermore, clients also tend to have a clear 
evaluation of their willingness to engage in citizenship behaviors. 


To obtain a representative sample, we filtered 200 clients whose ES 
services are at the post-implementation stage from a list of client firms 
provided by BS Company. The executives in charge of ES implementa-
tion in the client firms were selected as our key respondents because of 
their vast amount of knowledge on ES services and their familiarity with 
ES implementation processes. The client representatives of BS Company 
have the names and addresses of their client firms as well as the names 
and contact information of the key respondents. So, the client repre-
sentatives of BS Company assisted us in distributing the questionnaires 
to the key respondents through an online link. Meanwhile, we kept in 
touch with client representatives in BS Company and make sure they 
invited and distributed our questionnaires to the key respondents. The 
liaison between client representatives in BS Company and client firms is 
useful for improving response rate as well as quality. To minimize the 
biases induced by personal links, we specified in questionnaires and 
when distributing the questionnaires what our academic purpose was 
and promised no further use of their personal information. Several 
rounds of follow-up reminders were conducted to maximize the 
response rate. 


Out of a total of 200 questionnaires, 135 complete questionnaires 
were obtained, with a response rate of 62.5 %. As all data were collected 
through the survey, non-response bias is a concern. To access this po-
tential non-response bias, we compared early and late responses on key 
firm characteristics. The chi-square test on ownership type 
(χ2(3) = 3.276, p = 0.351), firm size (χ2(5) = 8.780, p = 0.118), firm 
history (χ2(5) = 3.576, p = 0.612), and number of IT employees

ES vendor’s obligation for: 


(1) Accurate project scoping Define precisely the nature and range of services 
covered in the outsourcing contract, and be 
flexible in handling customers’ requests for 
changes in these services. 


(2) Clear authority structures Delineate the decision-making rights and 
reporting structures in the project, in terms of the 
roles and responsibilities of all parties involved. 


(3) Taking charge Complete the job and solve problems 
independently, with minimal customer 
involvement. 


(4) Effective human capital 
management 


Assign high-quality staff to work on the project 
and minimize staff turnover during the project. 


(5) Effective knowledge transfer Educate customers in terms of the necessary 
skills, knowledge, and expertise associated with 
using the outsourced system or service. 


(6) Building effective 
interorganizational teams 


Invest time and effort to foster a good working

(χ2(3) = 5.627, p = 0.131) showed no significant differences, indi-
cating that non-response bias was not a serious problem in this study 
[85]. Table 3 shows the demographic information. 


3.2. Measures 


As our domain of interest in this study concerns psychological con-
cepts and behaviors, we reviewed the literature on psychological con-
tracts, organizational behaviors, and interfirm relationships. Grounding 
our theoretical model in the extant literature allowed us to adapt 
existing scales for measurement. An English questionnaire was first 
developed, which adopts a five-point Likert scale with measurement 
ranging from 1 (“strongly disagree”) to 5 (“strongly agree”). Following 
translation/back-translation procedures [86], the questionnaire was 
then translated into Chinese and checked by two scholars and six 
doctoral students in relevant fields to ensure content validity. The Chi-
nese questionnaire was then translated back into English by a profes-
sional and no semantic discrepancies were identified when compared 
with the original English version. A complete list of items in the ques-
tionnaire is shown in the Appendix. 


3.2.1. Psychological contract obligation and fulfillment 
The measurements of psychological contract obligation and psy-


chological contract fulfillment were adapted from Koh et al. [19]. Psy-
chological contract obligation (PCO) and psychological contract 
fulfillment (PCF) were formulated as reflective second-order constructs, 
each having six dimensions: accurate project scoping (APS), clear au-
thority structures (CAS), taking charge (TAC), dedicated project staffing 
(DPS), knowledge sharing (KNS), and building effective interorganiza-
tional teams (BEI). The expected obligations and corresponding fulfill-
ments were tested separately by asking: “My firm believes that the ES 
vendor should take following obligations” and “In fact, the ES vendor 
fulfilled the following obligations.” 


3.2.2. Client citizenship behavior 
The CCB measurement was adapted from Groth [65] and was 


formulated as a reflective second-order construct with the following 
categories: recommendations (REC), helping other customers (HEP), 
and providing feedback (PFB). Each category was tested by asking: “My 
firm willing to….” 


3.2.3. Control variables 
We controlled for several variables that could affect CCBs. Dummy 


variables were used for firm ownership. Ownership 1 refers to state- 
owned companies, ownership 2 refers to privately owned companies, 
ownership 3 refers to foreign-owned companies, and ownership 4 refers 
to sino-foreign joint companies. Dummy variables were also used for 
firm age where firm age 1 refers to less than 1 year, firm age 2 refers to 
1–3 years, firm age 3 refers to 4–6 years, firm age 4 refers to 7–10 years, 
firm age 5 refers to 11–15 years, and firm age 6 refers to more than 15 
years. Firm size was measured by dummy variables that represent the 
number of employees, where firm size 1 refers to less than 10 employees, 
firm size 2 refers to 10–50 employees, firm size 3 refers to 51–100 em-
ployees, firm size 4 refers to 101–200 employees, firm size 5 refers to 
201–300 employees, and firm size 6 refers to more than 300 employees. 
IT department size was also measured by dummy variables representing 
the number of IT employees, where size 1 denotes less than 2 IT em-
ployees, size 2 denotes two to five IT employees, size 3 denotes 6–10 IT 
employees, size 4 denotes 11–15 IT employees, and size 5 denotes more 
than 16 IT employees. 


3.3. Analysis 


3.3.1. Multicollinearity and common method bias 
Although several inter-construct correlations were greater than the 


benchmark of 0.600 (see Table 2), the test results revealed that the 
highest variance inflation factor (VIF) was 4.526, lower than the sug-
gested benchmark value of 5 (e.g., [87]). Therefore, multicollinearity 
was not a severe problem in our dataset. To further mitigate multi-
collinearity, we mean-centered PCO and PCF before regressions were 
conducted. 


Since the data were perceptual and collected from one informant to 
answer the self-reported questionnaire, common method bias might be a 
potential threat to the validity of the study. To minimize this bias, we 
adopted different instructions for different scales and arranged the 
constructs into distinct sections when designing the questionnaire [88]. 
Furthermore, we conducted three tests to check for potential common 
method bias. First, Harman’s one-factor test was performed using 
exploratory factor analysis (EFA) [88]. The results showed that 14 
distinct factors with eigenvalues of more than 1.0 explained 72.5 % of 
the total variance. The first factor explained 25.0 % of variance (not the 
majority of the total variance), thereby indicating that the common 
method bias was not likely to be a serious problem. Second, we 
compared the fit between the one-factor model and measurement model 
to assess the occurrence of common method bias [89]. The one-factor 
model yielded fit indices (χ2/df = 3144.777/902 = 3.486, 
CFI = 0.354, NNFI = 0.322, RMSEA = 0.136, SRMR = 0.143) that were 
unacceptable and significantly worse than the fit of the measurement 
model (χ2/df = 1860.003/1070 = 1.738, CFI = 0.806, NNFI = 0.778, 
RMSEA = 0.074, SRMR = 0.061). Third, we employed the confirmatory 
factor analysis (CFA) marker-variable technique to check whether there 
is a significant correlation between the maker variable (i.e., a method 
factor) and the hypothesized variables [90]. The marker variable that 
specifically designed for observing the shared variance between a 
method factor and hypothesized factors is theoretically unrelated to our 
hypothesized variables. In this study, a single-item scale for the marker 
variable was adapted from B. Fynes* et al. [91], which was included in 
the questionnaire to evaluate the competitive intensity of the industry. 
Respondents are asked to evaluate the question: “Competition in our 
industry is cut-throat” (1 = strongly disagree, 5 = strongly agree). 
Following the procedure of Malhotra et al. [90], the CFA 
marker-variable technique evaluates common method bias by checking 
statistical differences between a basic measurement model (with only 
hypothesized variables) and an extended measurement model (with 
both hypothesized variables and a marker variable). The results show no 
significant improvement in model fit indices: the basic model 
(χ2/df = 1860.003/1070 = 1.738, CFI = 0.806, NNFI = 0.778, 
RMSEA = 0.074, SRMR = 0.061) vs. the extended model

(χ2/df = 1919.986/1105 = 1.738, CFI = 0.803, NNFI = 0.773, 
RMSEA = 0.074, SRMR = 0.061). The results indicate that common 
method bias was not a serious problem in this study [91]. 


3.3.2. Confirmatory factor analysis 
We conducted CFA to evaluate the reliability and validity of the 


measurements. The composite reliability (CR) of first-order constructs 
followed the procedure of first-order factor analysis [92]. The 
second-order factors are predicted to account for the correlations among 
the first-order factors. We followed the procedure of second-order factor 
analysis to estimate the CR of second-order constructs (i.e., PCO, PCF, 
and CCBs) [92]. As shown in Table 4, all items are reasonable indicators 
of their respective first-order factors with factor loadings higher than the 
suggested benchmark 0.700. Table 5 presents the correlations among 
the first-order factors and are significantly interrelated, which speaks to 
the viability of second-order constructs. Thus, the composite reliabilities 
of second-order factors are calculated based on the loadings of their 
respective first-order factors that loaded onto the second-order factors. 
The results indicate that the values of CR are also higher than the 
benchmark value of 0.700. Furthermore, the values of the average 
variance extracted (AVE) are higher than the threshold of 0.500 [93]. 
Therefore, the constructs have acceptable convergent validity. Table 5 
shows that the inter-construct correlations are lower than the corre-
sponding square root of AVEs, suggesting good discriminant validity 
[94]. Overall, the results of second-order CFA suggest that the 
second-order aggregates (i.e., PCO, PCF, and CCBs) fit the data appro-
priately. To better describe and summarize features of a collection of 
information, we presented the mean values of aggregated first-order 
variables as well as their standardized deviations in Table 5. In the 
subsequent regression analysis, we performed the value of the 
second-order aggregates as the average value of their first-order aggre-
gates that were aggregated from the value of respective indicators. 


3.4. Polynomial regression and response surface analysis 


To test our hypotheses and capture the differential effects of under- 
fulfillment, fulfillment, and over-fulfillment of psychological contract, we 
used polynomial modeling and response surface methodology to address 
the research gaps [95–97]. Models that utilize a congruence between 
variables are common in information systems research. Both difference 
scores and polynomial modeling are used to examine the congruence 
effect. However, the difference scores methodology has several 
well-recognized limitations [98,99], including discarded information 
because of using difference scores to gain a single measure for further 
analyses and less robust due to unrealistically restrictive constraints on 
the difference scores model [98]. Polynomial models address the limi-
tations of difference scores (i.e., linear models) by allowing the exami-
nation of curvilinear relationships between component measures [98]. 
Therefore, Edwards and his colleagues recommended using polynomial 
modeling to generate three-dimensional response surfaces to examine 
the congruence/incongruence effects [95,100]. The response surface 
methodology provides an interpretive framework with mathematical 
and statistical techniques to show the features of the surface corre-
sponding to polynomial equations [101]. When coupled with response 
surface methodology, polynomial modeling can precisely capture the 
inherent three-dimensional relationships of obligations and fulfillments 
with CCBs [33,72], which provides a successful way of revealing the 
complexity in theories of congruence [102]. After Klein et al. [99]’s 
recommendation of polynomial modeling as a method of addressing 
more complex relationships in IS studies, polynomial modeling and 
response surface analysis have been widely used in information systems 
(IS) research. Table 6 provides an overview. 


The quadratic regression equation is illustrated below:  


CCBs = b0 + b1PCF + b2PCO + b3PCF
2 
+ b4PCF × PCO + b5PCO


2 
+ e.   


(1) 


We followed the regression procedure that the dependent variable 
(CCBs) was regressed on control variables as well as five polynomial 
terms: psychological contract obligation (PCO), psychological contract 
fulfillment (PCF), psychological contract obligation squared (PCO2), 
psychological contract fulfillment times psychological contract obliga-
tion (PCF × PCO), and psychological contract fulfillment squared 
(PCF2). To mitigate multicollinearity between component measures and 
their associated higher-order terms, PCF and PCO were centered around 
the pooled grand mean before calculating the higher-order terms [105]. 


After polynomial regression, we performed a response surface anal-
ysis. Following the procedure described in Edwards and Parry’s [100]

literature, we examined the basic features of the response surface: slopes 
and curvatures along lines of interest—fulfillment line (PCF = PCO) and 
breach line (PCF = - PCO). As shown in Fig. 1A, the comparison of ex-
pected obligations and perceived fulfillments was captured by the 
two-dimensional space on the floor of the graph. The fulfillment line 
(PCF = PCO) proceeded from the front corner to the rear corner and 
captured variation at absolute levels where perceived fulfillments equal 
perceived obligations. The breach line (PCF =–PCO) proceeded from the 
left corner to the right corner. Along this line, the region where fulfill-
ments are less than obligations represents deficiency, whereas the region 
where fulfillments are greater than obligations signifies excess. Fig. 1B 
illustrates the shape of the surface along the fulfillment line and Fig. 1C 
shows the shape of the surface along the breach line. To test Hypothesis 
1 and Hypothesis 2, we examined two key features of the plotted 


response surface: the slope as well as the curvature of the surface along 
breach line (PCF = - PCO). According to Edwards and Parry [100], the 
shape of the surface along PCF = - PCO line can be calculated by sub-
stituting—PCF for PCO in Eq. 1. Then, the slope of the surface along PCF 
= - PCO line can be calculated as (b1–b2) and the curvature of the surface 
along this line is (b3–b4 + b5). When the slope along the breach line is 
positive and significant, we are able to conclude that under-fulfillment is 
negatively associated with CCBs (i.e., Hypothesis 1) and over-fulfillment 
is positively associated with CCBs (i.e., Hypothesis 2). To test Hypothesis 
3, we examined the slope as well as the curvature of the surface along 
fulfillment line (PCF = PCO). Similarly, the shape of the surface along 
fulfillment line (PCF = PCO) can be calculated by substituting PCF for 
PCO in Eq. 1. Thus, along the PCF = PCO line, the slope of the surface 
can be calculated as (b1 + b2) and the curvature of the surface is (b3 + b4 
+ b5). If the sums are zero, then the surface is flat along PCF = PCO line. 
If the slope along the PCF = PCO line is positive and significant, we are 
able to conclude that CCBs are higher when obligation and fulfillment 
match at a high level than match at a low level (i.e., Hypothesis 3). 


4. Results 


4.1. Hypotheses testing 


To avoid misleading interpretation of the results, we checked the 
statistic power with our sample size of 135. We used G*Power 3.1 [106] 
to test the statistical power of our model. Specifically, we conducted a 
post hoc analysis (the statistical power 1 − β is calculated as a function 
of significant level, sample size, and population effect size) and set the α 
error probability of 0.05 [103]. The results show that the statistic power 
(1 − β) is 0.98 (F = 3.06), above the minimum threshold of 0.80 [107]. 
Furthermore, the join significant analysis of second-order polynomial

terms (PCF2, PCO × PCF, and PCO2) significantly lead to an increase in 
R2 (ΔR2 = 0.109, p < 0.01). Thus, the results showed a satisfactory 
statistical power for this research model. In addition, extant studies 
using polynomial modeling have adopted a similar sample size as this 
research and delivered valid results [96,103–105]. Based on the above, 
we believe that the sample size of this study is large enough for hy-
potheses testing. 


Table 7 reports the polynomial regressions results as well as the 
slopes and curvatures along the fulfillment line and breach line. Spe-
cifically, in the regression models, we controlled for firm ownership, 
firm size, firm history, and number of IT employees. In Model 2, we 
considered the linear model and, in Model 3, we added the three poly-
nomial terms. Our results indicate that the three second-order 


polynomial terms (PCF2, PCO × PCF, and PCO2) were jointly significant 
in predicting CCBs (F = 7.16, p < 0.001). As the variance explained by 
higher-order terms is significantly higher than that explained by the 
linear model (i.e., Model 2), the curvilinear model (i.e., Model 3) was 
found to be more favorable than the linear model (see [95,108]). To 
illustrate the principles of polynomial modeling, Fig. 1 illustrates the 
three-dimensional response surface based on these coefficients. 


Hypothesis 1 suggests that CCBs will be reduced to the extent that the 
perceived fulfillments fall short of expected obligations, and Hypothesis 
2 suggests that CCBs will increase as perceived fulfillment exceeds ex-
pected obligations. Examining the response surface, Fig. 1C indicates an 
inverted U-shaped surface along the breach line with the curvature 
showing a negative significance (curvature =–1.927, p < 0.05). Fig. 1C 
in the deficiency region shows that CCBs go down when fulfillments fall 
short of obligations (i.e., under-fulfillment), indicating that psycholog-
ical contract under-fulfillment is negatively associated with CCBs, thus 
supporting Hypothesis 1. However, the inverted U-shaped surface along 
the excess region signifies that CCBs go down when fulfillments exceed 
obligations (i.e., over-fulfillment), indicating that psychological con-
tract over-fulfillment is also negatively related to CCBs. This is contrary 
to what we predicted in Hypothesis 2. Thus, Hypothesis 2 was not 
supported. 


Hypothesis 3 suggests that the performance of CCBs is higher when 
perceived fulfillments and perceived obligations match at a high level as 
opposed to when they match at a low level. As shown in Table 7, the 
slope along the fulfillment line is significant and positive (slope = 0.908, 
p < 0.001), indicating that the performance of CCBs is higher when 
perceived fulfillments and expected obligations are both high as 
opposed to when both are low. Fig. 1B also indicates that the perfor-
mances of CCBs are higher at the rear corner (high/high congruence) 
than at the front corner (low/low congruence), thus supporting Hy-
pothesis 3. Additionally, the positive curvature (curvature = 0.939, p <
0.01) along the fulfillment line indicates a nonlinear relationship be-
tween psychological contract fulfillment and CCBs. 


For post hoc analyses, we tested whether or not clients react differ-
ently toward under-fulfillment and over-fulfillment, since both psycho-
logical contract under-fulfillment and over-fulfillment were negatively 
related to CCBs. The quantity of lateral shift of the surface along the 
breach line is nonsignificant (lateral shift =–0.158, n.s.), indicating that

Fig. 1C shows a symmetrical incongruence effect along the breach line. 
Thus, CCBs were shown to decrease symmetrically when psychological 
contract fulfillments deviated from psychological contract obligations in 
either direction. 


4.2. Robustness analysis 


To provide additional evidence that both under-fulfillment and over- 
fulfillment of psychological contract were negatively related to CCBs, we 
introduced the concept of fulfillment-obligation match (FOM) (i.e., the 
match between the level of delivered fulfillments and the level of ex-
pected obligations). Following the difference scores approach [109], we 
measured FOM as the absolute difference between the delivered ful-
fillments and expected obligations; that is, FOM = |PCF–PCO|. The 
higher value of FOM indicates a higher mismatch and the lower value 
indicates a closer match between PCF and PCO. Table 8 presents the 
results. The results show that FOM is negatively related to CCBs (β 
=–0.253, p < 0.01). The negative correlation between FOM and CCBs 
indicates the higher mismatch (i.e., higher FOM) the fewer CCBs. 
Additionally, the higher FOM indicates PCF and PCO deviate from 
perfect match in either direction (i.e., under-fulfillment or 
over-fulfillment). In other words, both under-fulfillment and 
over-fulfillment of psychological contracts were found to be negatively 
related to CCBs, supporting H1 and H2. 


5. Discussion and implications 


5.1. Discussion of the results 


Based on SET, this study offers a better understanding of CCBs from a 
psychological contract perspective in the context of ES vendor–client 
relationships. Our results support that psychological contract under- 
fulfillment is negatively associated with CCBs, which is consistent with 
existing individual-level research findings that psychological contract 
breach or violation can lead to various negative employee attitudes and 
behaviors, such as organizational citizenship behaviors (e.g., [12,13, 
45]). This finding confirms that under-fulfillment of psychological con-
tract leads to inequality in the social exchange between ES vendors and 
client firms. To maintain equity, client firms tend to reciprocate this 
unfair social exchange by reducing their CCBs [43]. The result also 
confirms that the under-fulfillment of psychological contract leads to 
negative beliefs and distrust which damages the reciprocal exchange 
norms between ES vendors and client firms [29]. Consequently, client 
firms may feel much less obligated to benefit their ES vendors through 
CCBs. Furthermore, we found that CCBs still maintain a moderate level 
of performance when perceived fulfillment fell a little short of expected 
obligations, which can be explained as a situation where psychological 
contract obligations are insufficiently fulfilled but not strong enough to 
arouse perceived violation emotionally [25]. Our findings also support 
that CCBs will be higher when fulfillments and obligations match at a 
high level as opposed to when they match at a low level. This indicates 
that ES vendors fulfilling strong obligations will earn more CCBs than 
fulfilling weak obligations. 


Counterintuitively, however, our results indicate that psychological 
contract over-fulfillment is negatively associated with CCBs. This differs 
from what we understood through SET as well as what we learned in 
individual-level research studies claiming that over-fulfilling em-
ployees’ expectations will enhance the exchange of positive behaviors 
(e.g., [45,74]). We provide the following plausible explanation for this 
counterintuitive finding. Specifically, the high level of exceeded fulfill-
ments may indicate relatively low or even no expected obligations on 
the clients’ behalf toward their ES vendor. Hence, clients might not be 
willing to reward ES vendors for fulfillments they do not need. 
Furthermore, the exceeded fulfillments may come at huge costs for ES 
vendors, of which clients may not be willing to cover. On the other hand, 
in ES vendor–client relationships, clients pay ES vendors for services. 
Under this condition, clients may feel it is fair when perceiving that ES 
vendors try to fulfill more than expected to satisfy them. More impor-
tantly, prior research suggests that the likelihood of perceiving 
over-fulfillment tends to be lower than the likelihood of perceiving 
under-fulfillment [12,110,111]. Accordingly, clients tend to ignore 
over-fulfillment behaviors, especially when they perceive their ES 
vendor as having low levels of obligations. Clients thus have less con-
sciousness to engage in more extra-role behaviors as social exchanges. 


5.2. Theoretical implications 


We expect that the findings of our study can provide the following 
theoretical implications. First, while prior IS research focuses on 
studying IT personnel’s or employees’ citizenship behaviors in IS con-
tracting (e.g., [17,55]) and ES success (e.g. [7,112],), this study extends 
individual-level citizenship behavior to an inter-organizational context 
and examines CCBs through a psychological contract perspective in ES 
projects. The results show that the fulfillment of psychological contract 
exerts great influence on a client’s voluntary engagement in ES projects. 
Therefore, this study affords a deeper understanding of psychological 
contract theory in the context of IS outsourcing and provides new in-
sights as to how to encourage client participation in ES projects from a 
psychological contract perspective. 


Second, this study focuses on both under-fulfillment and over- 
fulfillment of psychological contract, thus enriching the un-
derstandings of the effects of psychological contract over-fulfillment on 
CCBs in ES vendor–client relationships. Although our results show a 
distinct influence of psychological contract over-fulfillment on CCBs, 
this counterintuitive finding may indicate that SET is not suitable for 
predicting behaviors in the situation of over-fulfillment. Exceeding 
fulfillment in situations where the goal has already been achieved 
challenges the basic assumption of SET that self-interested parties 
transact or exchange with each other to accomplish outcomes they could 
not achieve on their own [113,114]. Therefore, the finding extends our 
understanding of social exchange between ES vendors and their clients 
and provides an anomaly that stimulates additional theorizing for future 
research. 


Third, by reflecting on the distinction between obligations and ful-
fillments, this study extends psychological contract literature by 
considering the effects of congruence between expected obligations and 
perceived fulfillments. The results demonstrate that whether the obli-
gations are fulfilled exerts a significant influence on clients’ engagement 
in voluntary behaviors in ES projects. Thus, our study provides a refer-
ence point for further research to identify those strong obligations 
comprising psychological contracts in IS outsourcing. 


5.3. Practical implications 


Our findings also suggest some practical implications. This study 
suggests that both under-fulfillment and over-fulfillment of psycholog-
ical contracts are negatively associated with CCBs. In other words, cli-
ents are likely to exhibit the highest performance of citizenship 
behaviors when ES vendors perfectly fulfill the psychological contracts

of clients. Thus, ES vendor managers should carefully assess their cli-
ent’s expected obligations and pay special attention to avoiding under- 
fulfilling and over-fulfilling. As clients behave equivalently to both 
under-fulfillment and over-fulfillment of psychological contracts, ES 
vendor managers are also advised not to spend more energy and re-
sources in exceeding their clients’ expectations. Because clients have no 
reason to kind mind or complain, ES vendors might not be aware that 
their efforts at over-fulfillment are likely being performed in vain, and 
might thus continue to allocate resources to maintain over-fulfillment in 
exchange for CCBs. 


Finally, ES vendor managers should be cautious that under-fulfilling 
or over-fulfilling a high level of expected obligation might lead to a 
sharp decrease in CCBs. Therefore, we suggest that ES managers care-
fully and clearly assess which kinds of obligations are strongly expected 
by their clients before ES implementation and, during ES implementa-
tion, ES vendor managers should make the necessary adjustments to 
achieve fulfillment and not seriously under-fulfill or over-fulfill these 
obligations. 


5.4. Limitations and future directions 


The limitations of this study present avenues for further research. 
First, we had no avenue to collect data from a random ES vendor–client 
sample, and the data we did collect came from the clients of a single ES 
vendor in China. While collecting data from a single ES vendor does 
make the results more reliable since the obligations perceived by clients 
are comparable because they face the same ES product and vendor, our 
results are still limited in generalization. Collecting data from a random 
ES vendor–client sample in future research would better address this 
external validity problem. 


Second, our results indicate that over-fulfillment of psychological 
contracts exerts a negative impact on CCBs in ES vendor–client re-
lationships. This finding is inconsistent with what we understood 


through SET. Although we provided several plausible explanations for 
this, further research should explore why psychological contract over- 
fulfillment leads to a negative impact on CCBs in ES implementation. 


Third, this study was mainly conducted from the client’s perspective 
as we focused on the obligations expected by clients toward ES vendors. 
Since each party possesses a unique psychological contract based on its 
own understanding of the reciprocal obligations in an ES project [19], 
discrepancies may occur because clients and ES vendors tend to have a 
difference in opinion regarding what the ES vendor is obligated to 
provide. It would thus be interesting to explore the impact of con-
gruence/incongruence between the two parties’ perceived obligations 
on CCBs. 


Fourth, we focused on the relationship between psychological con-
tracts and CCBs in a buyer–supplier relationship. This relationship may 
be influenced by contextual elements. Future research should explore 
environmental or relationship-specific moderators, such as competitive 
intensity, relationship length, and interfirm governance.
